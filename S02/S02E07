1
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:50,300
Be quiet back there!
These roads are SLICK!

2
00:01:50,335 --> 00:01:51,265
Hey Cartman. What?

3
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:53,300
Are you gonna share any of
that cake with the rest of us?

4
00:01:53,335 --> 00:01:55,265
Mm, let me think. No.

5
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:58,300
Come on fatass, you shouldn't
be eating all that cake anyway.

6
00:01:58,335 --> 00:02:00,300
Mm it's chocolaty and delightful.

7
00:02:00,335 --> 00:02:01,817
GIVE US SOME CARTMAN!

8
00:02:01,852 --> 00:02:03,265
Be quiet back there!

9
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:05,300
Whoa dude, the road is
really snowy out there.

10
00:02:05,335 --> 00:02:06,265
The road is always snowy.

11
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:09,265
I know but it's REALLY snowy today.

12
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:12,300
Mm I can't possibly
finish this whole cake,

13
00:02:12,335 --> 00:02:14,346
uh, oh yes I can. SHUT UP CARTMAN!

14
00:02:19,335 --> 00:02:21,265
Ok, that does it.

15
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:24,571
Ya'll be quiet or the
cute little bunny dies!

16
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:34,300
Dude she always tries to quiet us
down by threatening to kill that bunny,

17
00:02:34,335 --> 00:02:38,300
but I wonder if she ever would.
Oh she would dude, she would.

18
00:02:38,335 --> 00:02:41,265
GOD!

19
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:43,314
Oh for Christ sake I
don't believe this!

20
00:02:46,335 --> 00:02:51,265
Come on fat boy give us some cake now.

21
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:56,300
I cannot possibly eat one more
bit of this chocolaty goodness...

22
00:02:56,335 --> 00:02:58,265
oh wait wait wait try..

23
00:02:58,300 --> 00:03:01,300
DAMN IT CARTMAN YOU
ARE SUCH A FAT FUCK!

24
00:03:01,335 --> 00:03:02,665
What did you say?!?!?

25
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:15,265
I'm scared! Be quiet kid!

26
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:23,300
And right up here you can
see a red bellied chickadee.

27
00:03:23,335 --> 00:03:28,300
They're indigious to this area.

28
00:03:28,335 --> 00:03:33,317
What was that?

29
00:03:33,352 --> 00:03:38,300
What was what?

30
00:03:38,335 --> 00:03:39,265
All done.

31
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:43,265
Sit down and shut up!

32
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:47,300
I said quiet! Or else
I'll kill the bunny!

33
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:50,299
- Where are we?
- I have no idea.

34
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:52,300
I don't think we're in a very safe spot.

35
00:03:52,335 --> 00:03:53,265
Yeah what are we supposed to do?

36
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:56,500
Just keep your traps shut,
I'll consult the manual.

37
00:04:01,335 --> 00:04:02,265
Ms. Crabtree?

38
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:06,265
Shut up kid! I have to
watch a training video!

39
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:10,300
Hello and welcome to tape 7
of the bus drivers video guide.

40
00:04:10,335 --> 00:04:12,265
What to do if you become stranded.

41
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:15,265
By now you've calm down the
children and kept order by using the

42
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:18,300
"keep-quiet-or-I'll-kill-the-bunny"
technique. Now it's time to get help.

43
00:04:18,335 --> 00:04:21,300
The most important thing to remember
is the children will be safe as long

44
00:04:21,335 --> 00:04:25,300
as they stay on the bus. So
do not under any circumstances

45
00:04:25,335 --> 00:04:27,265
let any children off the bus.

46
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:30,300
The best way to achive this
is to tell them something like

47
00:04:30,335 --> 00:04:33,300
"a big scary monster will eat
you if you step off the bus"

48
00:04:33,335 --> 00:04:35,265
Kids! Do not get off this bus!

49
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:39,265
If you do a big scary
monster will eat you!

50
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:41,300
That's right. With the children
properly subdued, you can leave

51
00:04:41,335 --> 00:04:44,265
the bus and go out
looking for assistance.

52
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:47,300
And remember your bus driver's
code: "sit down and shut up!"

53
00:04:47,335 --> 00:04:50,265
I'm going for help. I'll
be back as soon as I can.

54
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:54,514
Remember don't get off this bus or
a big scary monster WILL EAT YOU!

55
00:04:57,335 --> 00:05:00,265
Hey why doens't the
scary monster eat her?

56
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:03,300
Cause dumbass, scary monsters
don't eat big fat smelly bitches.

57
00:05:03,335 --> 00:05:05,265
What did you say?

58
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:09,265
I said Larry King
won't grant me 3 wishes!

59
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:15,300
Hey this is not good. She
could've at least left the heat on.

60
00:05:15,335 --> 00:05:19,265
Had to happen to me didn't it?

61
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:25,300
Looking for love oooh baby,
looking for loove, doooo

62
00:05:25,335 --> 00:05:28,317
Oy, supper time. Come to papa.

63
00:05:28,352 --> 00:05:31,265
Hello little lady. Going my way?

64
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:35,300
SHUT UP AND HELP ME
INTO THIS THING!

65
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:37,743
Come on I haven't got all day!

66
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:48,300
Take me to the nearest town and make
it snappy you freak ass crack pot!

67
00:05:48,335 --> 00:05:50,265
Yes ma'am, right away ma'am.

68
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:54,300
So uh, what's a fragile dove like
yourself, doing out on a a night like this?

69
00:05:54,335 --> 00:05:57,300
Look mister, I gotta bus load
of kids trapped on that pass,

70
00:05:57,335 --> 00:06:00,300
and I need a crane,
helicopters and all that crap!

71
00:06:00,335 --> 00:06:03,317
Here let me have some of your aspirin.

72
00:06:03,352 --> 00:06:06,265
Uh, uh ma'am those are actually roofies.

73
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:09,300
Roofies, aspirin, right now
I don't give a rat's ass.

74
00:06:09,335 --> 00:06:11,300
How far to the nearest town?

75
00:06:11,335 --> 00:06:14,265
Mmm sweet.

76
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:19,300
You guys, what if Ms. Crabtree doesn't come
back and we're all trapped here forever?

77
00:06:19,335 --> 00:06:23,300
We couldn't get trapped here forever
Cartman. We'd die after a couple of days.

78
00:06:23,335 --> 00:06:24,265
Dude! What?

79
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:28,265
I don't wanna die on this bus
with you assholes! You guys suck!

80
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:32,300
Would you just relax? We've been in a lot worse
situations than this and come out of it just fine.

81
00:06:32,335 --> 00:06:33,265
Worse than this? Well sure.

82
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:36,300
Don't you remember that time when the
aliens kidnapped your little brother Ike?

83
00:06:36,335 --> 00:06:38,265
Now that was scary.

84
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:40,300
This sucks. How come the
visitors aren't coming for him?

85
00:06:40,335 --> 00:06:44,300
I think we have to signal them somehow.

86
00:06:44,335 --> 00:06:45,265
Hey he's like Rudolph.

87
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:48,300
Yeah, all you have to do
is fart some more Cartman,

88
00:06:48,335 --> 00:06:50,265
and the visitors are sure to come.

89
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:54,300
Really? Ah, I don't think
I can fart anymore tonight.

90
00:06:54,335 --> 00:06:55,265
Sure you do.

91
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:56,300
Come on Cartman, fart!

92
00:06:56,335 --> 00:06:57,265
I don't wanna.

93
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:58,300
He can't hold it in forever.

94
00:06:58,335 --> 00:07:00,265
Fart damn you!

95
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:03,265
Ok, that does it. Now listen!

96
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:05,300
Why is it that everything
today has involved things

97
00:07:05,335 --> 00:07:08,300
either going in or
coming out of my ass?!

98
00:07:08,335 --> 00:07:10,265
Whoa, look at that?

99
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:12,800
It's completely immature!

100
00:07:12,835 --> 00:07:15,265
Hey it's happening again!

101
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:18,300
It's an ice cream truck! Now
do you believe us Cartman?

102
00:07:18,335 --> 00:07:20,265
You guys can't scare me.

103
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:22,717
Cartman! There's an ice cream
truck sticking out of your ass!

104
00:07:27,335 --> 00:07:29,300
Hey look the aliens
are getting ice cream!

105
00:07:29,335 --> 00:07:33,265
Wow I guess everything's gonna be ok.

106
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:37,265
Now that was what I
call a sticky situation.

107
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:42,300
You can say that again.
Was that how it happened?

108
00:07:42,335 --> 00:07:44,317
Stop let me off you turd!

109
00:07:44,352 --> 00:07:46,265
Hey I wanna help you.

110
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:49,300
I care a lot about that bus
load of uh what was it again?

111
00:07:49,335 --> 00:07:50,265
Children.

112
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:54,300
Yeah right. Let me come with you.

113
00:07:54,335 --> 00:07:58,265
What the hell is this crap?

114
00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:02,300
I hate flying. Talk about
something I hate, it's flyin'.

115
00:08:02,335 --> 00:08:05,300
Say uh, are those
roofies kicking in yet?

116
00:08:05,335 --> 00:08:06,265
Well I don't think so!

117
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:08,265
Damn. You guys like impressions?

118
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:12,300
No! Here's my impression
of Robert Deniro,

119
00:08:12,335 --> 00:08:15,300
"Hey yous, yous guys, shut up yous!"

120
00:08:15,335 --> 00:08:17,265
You suck!

121
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:19,265
Yous guys shut up.

122
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:22,265
Sit down and shut up!

123
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:25,300
Come on lady, I love you, you love me!

124
00:08:25,335 --> 00:08:29,665
I SAID, SIT DOWN
AND SHUT UP!

125
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:35,265
Baby you're wonderful. You're a natural!

126
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:38,300
You're the funniest
comic I've seen in years!

127
00:08:38,335 --> 00:08:40,265
Why don't you just shut the hell up!

128
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:43,300
I've got to get some assistance
for my broken down bus!

129
00:08:43,335 --> 00:08:47,300
Broken down bus that's
great, great angle.

130
00:08:47,335 --> 00:08:49,265
Do you see her dude? Nope.

131
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:51,265
God damn it, how long
is this gonna take?

132
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:55,300
She's never coming back. Don't you get
it? She's left us here to die like pigs!

133
00:08:55,335 --> 00:08:58,265
Calm down dude, you're upsetting Kenny.

134
00:08:58,300 --> 00:09:01,265
I can't take it anymore!
I have to get out of here!

135
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:04,300
No kid! You heard what Ms. Crabtree said,
there's a big black scary monster out there.

136
00:09:04,335 --> 00:09:08,300
Well I'm not gonna sit here and
wait to die with the rest of you.

137
00:09:08,335 --> 00:09:11,300
If I make it back, I'll send help.

138
00:09:11,335 --> 00:09:12,265
Don't do it kid!

139
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:23,950
Maybe Ms. Crabtree did make that
stuff about the big black monster.

140
00:09:29,335 --> 00:09:30,700
Holy crap dude!

141
00:09:42,335 --> 00:09:47,265
Gross!

142
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:53,300
Well, I guess nobody else
will be getting off the bus.

143
00:09:53,335 --> 00:09:59,300
Hello? Oh hello Ms. Cartman,
it's Sharon, Stan's mother.

144
00:09:59,335 --> 00:10:01,317
Oh yes Sharon, how are you.

145
00:10:01,352 --> 00:10:03,300
Ms. Cartman is your son at home?

146
00:10:03,335 --> 00:10:05,300
Hold on dear, let me check.

147
00:10:05,335 --> 00:10:08,317
Hon I made beefy logs!

148
00:10:08,352 --> 00:10:10,326
I made cookie dings!

149
00:10:10,361 --> 00:10:12,265
Not he's not here.

150
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:17,300
Well now I am worried. I tried all the
houses and nobody know where they are.

151
00:10:17,335 --> 00:10:20,265
Oh dear.

152
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:22,800
I'm telling you Marty,
this woman is a natural.

153
00:10:22,835 --> 00:10:25,265
I haven't seen a funnier
person since Maury Povich.

154
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:28,300
What's her angle? I can't even
explain it. You have to see it.

155
00:10:28,335 --> 00:10:30,300
Alright, this better be good.

156
00:10:30,335 --> 00:10:32,265
Come on in, come on in.

157
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:35,300
What the hell did you
bring me to Denver for?

158
00:10:35,335 --> 00:10:37,317
You brainless brain fecolpheliac!

159
00:10:37,352 --> 00:10:39,300
Mr. Jonas, this is Ms. Crabtree.

160
00:10:39,335 --> 00:10:40,265
Pleasure to meet you.

161
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:44,300
You look like a lump of dog
shit just got hit by a CAR!

162
00:10:44,335 --> 00:10:45,817
What did I tell you?

163
00:10:45,852 --> 00:10:47,265
She's fantastic.

164
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:48,300
How would you like to make
a million dollars baby?

165
00:10:48,335 --> 00:10:50,317
How'd you like to suck my ass?

166
00:10:50,352 --> 00:10:52,265
Let's get started right away.

167
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:54,300
You gonna be alright? Don't touch me!

168
00:10:54,335 --> 00:10:56,300
I'm sorry do you need anything?

169
00:10:56,335 --> 00:10:58,265
No. I just... What?

170
00:10:58,300 --> 00:11:00,800
Can't help but feel like
I've forgotten something.

171
00:11:05,335 --> 00:11:07,265
What time is it? It is 12:07.

172
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:10,300
On Wednesday or Thursday?
Dude I think it's Saturday now.

173
00:11:10,335 --> 00:11:12,265
What? I'm missing the
new Fantasy Island.

174
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:14,265
Oh man I don't think it's
very safe to be on this bus.

175
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:17,300
Well we can't go anywhere or else that
big scary monster outside will get us.

176
00:11:17,335 --> 00:11:18,265
What do you think it is?

177
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:20,265
I don't know it's a big scary monster.

178
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:22,265
Hey, maybe it's that
thing scuzzlebutt. What?

179
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:28,300
Don't you remember? That time we were
out camping with your uncle Jimbo and Ned.

180
00:11:28,335 --> 00:11:30,300
That lava's coming right for us!

181
00:11:30,335 --> 00:11:31,678
Heeelp!

182
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:42,300
Jimini oaks! It's the real scuzzlebutt!

183
00:11:42,335 --> 00:11:44,317
What? Scuzzlebutt's real?

184
00:11:44,352 --> 00:11:46,265
Oh my god! Look at his leg!

185
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:49,265
Hi kids, I'm TV's Brent Mussberger.

186
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:52,300
Dude! He's got Brent
Mussberger for a leg!

187
00:11:52,335 --> 00:11:54,817
Quick Ned shoot it!

188
00:11:54,852 --> 00:11:57,300
MMm oh no, out of ammo!

189
00:11:57,335 --> 00:11:59,265
Hey look!

190
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:03,300
Dude he's making ice cream!

191
00:12:03,335 --> 00:12:05,265
Scuzzlebutt kicks ass!

192
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:08,265
Now that's what I call
a sticky situation!

193
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:12,300
Ok so we can agree that the monster outside
can't be Scuzzlebutt because Scuzzlebutt's nice.

194
00:12:12,335 --> 00:12:14,265
Hey, maybe it's our teacher Mr. Garrison.

195
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:18,300
Don't be stupid Cartman. Our teacher wouldn't
be out lying in the forest waiting to kill us.

196
00:12:18,335 --> 00:12:22,300
Oh no? Don't you remember the time he went
crazy, and tried to kill Kathie Lee Gifford?

197
00:12:22,335 --> 00:12:23,965
Here she comes!

198
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:34,265
Come on you little bitch.

199
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:38,300
It is with great pride and
honor that I'd like to welcome

200
00:12:38,335 --> 00:12:42,077
Mrs. Kathie Lee Gifford to South Park!

201
00:12:45,335 --> 00:12:48,265
Thank you.

202
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:50,265
Mr. Garrison! Stop!

203
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:52,300
Leave us! We must finish
what we have begun!

204
00:12:52,335 --> 00:12:54,265
But Mr. Garrison!

205
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:58,300
She's not really Kathie Lee
Gifford, she's some kind of alien.

206
00:12:58,335 --> 00:13:00,200
Thank you, how I love you all.

207
00:13:08,335 --> 00:13:11,265
See I told ya.

208
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:13,300
Well this is going to
put a damper on the day.

209
00:13:13,335 --> 00:13:17,300
Let's have ice cream everyone!

210
00:13:17,335 --> 00:13:18,265
BEEF-CAKE!

211
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:22,265
Now that's what I call
a sticky situation.

212
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:26,300
But the monster outside couldn't be
Mr. Garrison, cause Mr. Garrison used a gun.

213
00:13:26,335 --> 00:13:27,265
Oh yeah.

214
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:30,300
Live from Burbank, it's the
tonight show, with Jay Leno.

215
00:13:30,335 --> 00:13:33,265
Tonight Jay's special guests include

216
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:37,300
"Washed up actress from a citcom
and the comedy of Ms. Crabtree.

217
00:13:37,335 --> 00:13:40,265
And now here's your host, Jay Leno!

218
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:42,300
Just relax sweet heart
you're gonna kill out there.

219
00:13:42,335 --> 00:13:43,265
Kill who?

220
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:44,300
That's great, use that.

221
00:13:44,335 --> 00:13:45,265
Do you need anything?

222
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:47,300
Just give me another
one of them Roofies.

223
00:13:47,335 --> 00:13:50,265
Sure.

224
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:52,800
Uh ok, let's try to calm down mmkay.

225
00:13:52,835 --> 00:13:55,265
This type of thing happens all the time.

226
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:58,300
What do you mean? How often does an
entire 3rd grade class go missing?

227
00:13:58,335 --> 00:14:02,300
Well 99% of the time
when a child is missing,

228
00:14:02,335 --> 00:14:07,300
it's because they've run away, mmkay.

229
00:14:07,335 --> 00:14:08,265
Run away?

230
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:12,300
Oy, I knew I shouldn've made
Kyle eat that ghafagahaga.

231
00:14:12,335 --> 00:14:13,265
How do we get our runaway children back?

232
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:17,265
Well we just need to make some posters
mmkay, hand out brochures mmkay,

233
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:22,300
that way the public can know what the children
look like and can call in if they're spotted mmkay?

234
00:14:22,335 --> 00:14:26,265
Let's get started right away. They
could be half way to LA by now.

235
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:29,700
It's only a matter of time before they're
selling their bodies and buying smack!

236
00:14:43,335 --> 00:14:44,265
What was that? What was what?

237
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:46,800
Dude I think the scary monster
is right outside the bus.

238
00:14:46,835 --> 00:14:49,067
What could it be? If only we
knew what we were up against.

239
00:14:49,102 --> 00:14:51,300
Hey guys, do you remember that
time when death was after me?

240
00:14:51,335 --> 00:14:54,817
Oh yeah I remember that.

241
00:14:54,852 --> 00:14:58,265
And... mmmmfmfmmfmfmmhmmm

242
00:14:58,300 --> 00:15:02,265
Come back here you
pompouse son of a pansy!

243
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:05,300
Don't let him touch you!
You die if he touches you!

244
00:15:05,335 --> 00:15:08,500
Come over here you son of a whore!

245
00:15:11,938 --> 00:15:16,201
Take that! And that, and
that, that! Take that!

246
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:18,300
Oh my god! Kenny... killed death!

247
00:15:18,335 --> 00:15:22,265
You... bastard?

248
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:25,300
Now that's what I call
a sticky situation.

249
00:15:25,335 --> 00:15:27,817
Yeah but the moster
outside couldn't be death,

250
00:15:27,852 --> 00:15:30,300
cause death only touches
you, it doesn't eat you.

251
00:15:30,335 --> 00:15:31,265
Oh yeah.

252
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:35,300
Well who really cares what
that monster is outside.

253
00:15:35,335 --> 00:15:39,300
As long as you stay on the
bus it can't hurt us right?

254
00:15:39,335 --> 00:15:41,300
Oh my god! He's killing Kenny!

255
00:15:41,335 --> 00:15:43,265
You bastard!

256
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:46,265
Oh boy we're in big trouble.

257
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:48,103
Hey you guys, can we order a pizza?

258
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:56,300
What the hell are you
all staring at!?!?!?

259
00:15:56,335 --> 00:16:01,817
Stop laughing you whores!

260
00:16:01,852 --> 00:16:07,265
I SAID SHUT UP!

261
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:10,300
Let's hear it for Ms. Crabtree,
what an up and comer!

262
00:16:10,335 --> 00:16:11,817
Well, that was great ma'am.

263
00:16:11,852 --> 00:16:13,300
Was it? Does it even matter?

264
00:16:13,335 --> 00:16:14,265
What do you mean?

265
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:16,300
Success is hollow Mitch,
hollow like a dead tree.

266
00:16:16,335 --> 00:16:18,265
I think it's time for me to give it up.

267
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:24,265
Are you sure? I'm sure.
Let's get a cup of coffee.

268
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:28,300
I wonder when the monster's
gonna come back to feed again.

269
00:16:28,335 --> 00:16:29,265
We just gotta stick together.

270
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:32,300
Yeah there's got to
be a way out of this.

271
00:16:32,335 --> 00:16:33,265
Hey wait a minute. What?

272
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:36,026
Remember that time that Fonzie jumped
over the busses with his motorcycle?

273
00:16:42,335 --> 00:16:45,265
Go Fonzie!

274
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:48,191
- You can do it Fonzie!
- We believe in you Fonz!

275
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:10,300
Oh my god they killed Kenny!

276
00:17:10,335 --> 00:17:11,265
You bastard!

277
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:16,265
Now that's what I call
a sticky situation.

278
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:17,265
You dumbass Cartman! That's
not the way it happened?

279
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:22,300
Yeah dude, Kenny just died 8 hours ago from that
monster, how could he have died back then too?

280
00:17:22,335 --> 00:17:25,300
Oh yeah I guess that doesn't make sense.

281
00:17:25,335 --> 00:17:29,265
Oh no!

282
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:34,265
What are we gonna do?

283
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:37,300
Now we need more weight in the back.

284
00:17:37,335 --> 00:17:41,265
No that's too much!

285
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:42,265
There I think we got it.

286
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:44,800
I don't know how much longer
we can keep this up dude.

287
00:17:44,835 --> 00:17:47,265
Don't worry everything's
gonna work out, it always does.

288
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:50,400
It does? Sure remember that time that that kid
in the red shirt decided to go off on his own?

289
00:17:52,335 --> 00:17:55,300
Well I'm not gonna sit here and
wait to die with the rest of you.

290
00:17:55,335 --> 00:17:58,284
If I make it back, I'll
send help. Don't do it kid.

291
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:07,797
Hmm, maybe Ms. Crabtree did make that
stuff about the big black monster.

292
00:18:12,335 --> 00:18:15,265
Holy crap dude!

293
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:16,365
Hey look it's got ice cream!

294
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:25,765
Now that's what I call
a sticky situation.

295
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:35,300
Wow, this is gorgeous. I don't think
I've ever seen anything so beautiful.

296
00:18:35,335 --> 00:18:38,265
From a distance this place
looks like a cold damp marsh,

297
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:42,300
but once you get inside it you
realize that it has an inner beauty

298
00:18:42,335 --> 00:18:44,265
far surpassing others.

299
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:47,300
Thank you for sharing your
time with me Ms. Crabtree.

300
00:18:47,335 --> 00:18:48,265
Please, call me muffin.

301
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:50,265
I'm having a nice time muffin.

302
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:54,433
Me too Marcus. I've forgotten
all about my cares in the world.

303
00:18:57,335 --> 00:19:00,265
Oh damn man, now I'm missing
the new Barnaby Jones!

304
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:05,300
Hey, Ms. Crabtree had that little TV for the
training video, maybe we can watch TV on it.

305
00:19:05,335 --> 00:19:08,265
Hey yeah!

306
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:12,300
And all over America, kids are turning
to the streets, and running away.

307
00:19:12,335 --> 00:19:16,300
Tonight a very special message from
the parents of some run away children,

308
00:19:16,335 --> 00:19:20,300
and hopes that their
young will hear their cry.

309
00:19:20,335 --> 00:19:24,265

312
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:35,300
Little lamb, lost in
the great big world,

313
00:19:35,335 --> 00:19:40,300
runaway, finding streets, so cold...

314
00:19:40,335 --> 00:19:43,317
Dude, your dad's a retard!

315
00:19:43,352 --> 00:19:46,265
Please come home Kyle.

316
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:50,265

317
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:54,800

here waiting for you.

318
00:19:54,835 --> 00:19:59,265

love you just as you are.

319
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:03,800
Run away come home, we're
sorry things went this faar.

320
00:20:03,835 --> 00:20:08,300
Dude did it ever occur to
them to just look for us?

321
00:20:08,335 --> 00:20:10,265
I hope my dad doesn't sing.

322
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:13,300
Hey, do you guys remember the
time I found out who my father was?

323
00:20:13,335 --> 00:20:15,265
Boy do I!

324
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:20,300
As I said before, the father
is somebody in this room.

325
00:20:20,335 --> 00:20:25,300
The father is... John Elway!

326
00:20:25,335 --> 00:20:26,817
Sweeeett!

327
00:20:26,852 --> 00:20:28,265
Uh oh.

328
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:31,800
This kicks ass you guys!
John Elway's my father!

329
00:20:31,835 --> 00:20:35,300
My father is John Elway,
my father is John Elway!

330
00:20:35,335 --> 00:20:39,300
Come on son, I'll buy
you some ice cream.

331
00:20:39,335 --> 00:20:40,265
Now that's what I call a sticky...

332
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:43,300
Wait a minute. I thought your father
was your mother cause she had a penis!

333
00:20:43,335 --> 00:20:47,300
What? Ay! You son of a bitch
I'll kick you in the nuts!

334
00:20:47,335 --> 00:20:51,265
Cartman no!

335
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:53,812
The bus is going over! Oh no!

336
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:18,265
Hey we've landed in ice cream.

337
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:20,265
Wait, wait wait wait.
This doesn't make sense.

338
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:25,300
This whole thing doesn't
make any sense. I must be...

339
00:21:25,335 --> 00:21:27,300
Oh man what a weird dream!

340
00:21:27,335 --> 00:21:28,265
Are you ok hon?

341
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:32,265
Ma? I just dreamt that me and Stan and
Kyle and Kenny were trapped on a bus

342
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:35,300
and we were talking about everything that
happened to us except that it was all wrong,

343
00:21:35,335 --> 00:21:38,265
and ended with us eating ice cream.

344
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:41,300
Oh. Well would you like
some beetles for breakfast?

345
00:21:41,335 --> 00:21:47,265
Yes please.

346
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:51,300
Beetles are good with ice cream.

347
00:21:51,335 --> 00:21:55,300
AHH! Oh dude what a nightmare!

348
00:21:55,335 --> 00:21:56,265
Hello?

349
00:21:56,300 --> 00:21:58,265
Dude I just had the
weirdest dream. Really?

350
00:21:58,300 --> 00:22:01,265
Yeah I dreamt, that Cartman dreamt
that we were all trapped on a bus,

351
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:02,813
and then he dreamt that we were
talking about things that

352
00:22:02,815 --> 00:22:04,201
had happened only they
were all wrong, and,

353
00:22:04,335 --> 00:22:06,317
and then he and his mother ate beetles.

354
00:22:06,352 --> 00:22:08,265
Dude! That's a pretty fucked up dream!

355
00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:10,265
Yeah, I must be having some
real emotional problems.

356
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:12,300
Hey, me and Cartman and Kenny are
going down to Happy Burger. Wanna come?

357
00:22:12,335 --> 00:22:17,817
Sure, I definitly don't wanna
sleep anymore. See ya later.

358
00:22:17,852 --> 00:22:23,300
I wanna thank you for making
me feel alive again Marcus.

359
00:22:23,335 --> 00:22:24,265
What is it, what's wrong?

360
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:27,300
You realize I can't stay.
None of this is real.

361
00:22:27,335 --> 00:22:29,265
It's all been a little
8 year old's dream.

362
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:34,300
Oh I know. I know Marcus. But let
me just pretend as long as I can.

363
00:22:34,335 --> 00:22:36,300
Sure.
