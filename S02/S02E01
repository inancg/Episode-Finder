1
00:00:03,237 --> 00:00:09,187
Since the last South Park you've waited four long
weeks to find out who the father of Eric Cartman is.

2
00:00:09,317 --> 00:00:14,788
Now, finally, the shocking truth
about Cartman's lineage

3
00:00:14,817 --> 00:00:17,990
will not be seen tonight so we can bring
you the following special presentation

4
00:00:19,297 --> 00:00:23,129
Now, get ready for Canada's
hottest action stars.

5
00:00:23,137 --> 00:00:26,570
Terrance and Phillip in the
HBC Movie of the Week,

6
00:00:35,737 --> 00:00:38,510
Ladies and gentlemen, before
you today sits a murderer.

7
00:00:38,637 --> 00:00:42,087
On the night in question, this monster
entered the home of Dr. Jeffrey O'Dwyer,

8
00:00:42,117 --> 00:00:44,454
and struck him repeatedly in
the head with this hammer.

9
00:00:44,655 --> 00:00:48,755
That monster is sitting right over
there, and his name is Terrance.

10
00:00:51,037 --> 00:00:55,691
- Uh, Terrance, you farted in court.
- Yes Phillip, I'm making a case for our defense.

11
00:00:56,317 --> 00:00:58,345
All of these things link
Terrance to the murder:

12
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:02,009
hair fibers, blood samples,
nail clippings, a piece of his shirt.

13
00:01:03,197 --> 00:01:05,900
A watch with his initials on it, a day
planner with the murder scheduled.

14
00:01:07,237 --> 00:01:10,035
a haiku called "Time to
Kill Dr. Jeffrey O'Dwyer."

15
00:01:10,157 --> 00:01:14,673
"Dr. O'Dwyer, time to have your head
smashed in, with my new hammer."

16
00:01:15,797 --> 00:01:19,076
Terrance, you may be a famous
surgeon, but you're not God.

17
00:01:19,377 --> 00:01:21,077
Je accuse Terrance.

18
00:01:21,477 --> 00:01:24,172
- Would you like a monkey
claw Phillip? - Yes please.

19
00:01:25,757 --> 00:01:27,626
That's called the monkey
claw cause it feels like

20
00:01:27,628 --> 00:01:30,626
my colon is being ripped apart
by a thousand monkeys.

21
00:01:30,827 --> 00:01:32,222
The monkey claw is smelly.

22
00:01:32,657 --> 00:01:35,308
Come on, get a move-on, I ain't
getting a younger up here.

23
00:01:35,437 --> 00:01:39,715
My sentiments exactly Your Honor. I see from
your accent that you're Southern Canadian.

24
00:01:39,837 --> 00:01:43,989
- That is correct. - Good people of the jury,
my client Terrance is an innocent man.

25
00:01:44,677 --> 00:01:49,274
- Oh ho, Phillip, now you farted during the
closing argument. - I have, haven't I Terrance.

26
00:01:51,957 --> 00:01:54,819
Your Honor, the defense is trying
to make a mockery of this court.

27
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:57,510
They think farts are
funny, but they're not.

28
00:01:57,637 --> 00:02:00,852
- Sustained. - Good people
of the jury, my client Terrance...

29
00:02:00,853 --> 00:02:02,553
...is no more a murderer
than you or me.

30
00:02:02,677 --> 00:02:04,696
He loves puppies and
hates mean things.

31
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:08,611
Would a murderer go to the zoo
and feed animals like this?

32
00:02:08,797 --> 00:02:13,712
Of course not. So, in summation,
find Terrance innocent, or else he'll kill you.

33
00:02:16,237 --> 00:02:18,354
Just kidding. The defense rests.

34
00:02:18,977 --> 00:02:21,513
God damnit, that isn't funny!

35
00:02:22,677 --> 00:02:25,510
Madam Foreperson, have you reached a
verdict so we can get the hell out of here?

36
00:02:25,637 --> 00:02:27,762
We have Your Honor;
we have found Terrance,

37
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:32,154
in the above-entitled action of murder
against Dr. Jeffrey O'Dwyer...

38
00:02:33,237 --> 00:02:36,115
You're going to have to repeat that verdict
since we had some flatulence issues.

39
00:02:36,237 --> 00:02:37,651
I said, we find...

40
00:02:38,752 --> 00:02:39,752
We find Terrance...

41
00:02:40,877 --> 00:02:41,835
NOT GUILTY!!!

42
00:02:42,157 --> 00:02:44,849
Did you hear that Terrance?
You're not guilty!

43
00:02:44,977 --> 00:02:48,035
Oh Phillip, you saved me
from the gas chamber!

44
00:02:52,317 --> 00:02:55,626
That sure was fun. Let's go
home and eat Kroff Dinner.

45
00:02:56,157 --> 00:02:59,035
Well, looks like you got away
with it Terrance and Phillip.

46
00:02:59,157 --> 00:03:01,591
Oh, hello Scott. No hard
feelings, right old pal?

47
00:03:01,717 --> 00:03:03,668
There are hard feelings,
this isn't over.

48
00:03:03,669 --> 00:03:07,481
I'm going to see to it that you both
pay for what you've done.

49
00:03:08,077 --> 00:03:09,396
- And do you know why?
- 'Cause you're a dick?

50
00:03:09,517 --> 00:03:13,610
No, because I hate you. You think
farting is soo funny, well it isn't!

51
00:03:13,611 --> 00:03:16,912
Fart jokes are the lowest
form of comedy, and if I...

52
00:03:17,837 --> 00:03:20,704
Oh, I hate you both. I've hated
you ever since I can remember.

53
00:03:20,705 --> 00:03:22,905
I hate you and I wish
you both had cancer.

54
00:03:23,757 --> 00:03:26,146
- Cancer?
- Yes, in the head.

55
00:03:26,277 --> 00:03:30,873
- Head cancer? - This is not the end
Terrance and Phillip. You'll rue this day.

56
00:03:30,997 --> 00:03:34,866
- Wow, Scott really hates us Phillip.
- Yes, perhaps he's homophobic.

57
00:03:36,277 --> 00:03:38,996
- But we're not gay, Phillip.
- We're not?

58
00:03:39,117 --> 00:03:42,826
Well, let us board the subway and
return home. There we can eat Kroff Dinner.

59
00:03:42,957 --> 00:03:46,491
Yes, it's been a long day, and only
Kroff Dinner can calm my nerves.

60
00:03:53,717 --> 00:03:57,630
Say Phillip, why does Scott always try to
convict me of murder? He does it every week.

61
00:03:57,757 --> 00:04:00,988
He sure does seem to hate us.
I wonder what he'll try next.

62
00:04:01,117 --> 00:04:04,189
- God only knows. - The subway
certainly is wonderful Terrance.

63
00:04:04,317 --> 00:04:08,947
- It sure is. Let's look for treasure.
- Yes, let's look for treasure.

64
00:04:15,957 --> 00:04:18,452
- Hello?
- Hello, is this Scott from Canada?

65
00:04:18,553 --> 00:04:19,553
Yes, yes it is.

66
00:04:19,677 --> 00:04:23,352
- You're a journalist, right?
- Yes, I'm a television critic for magazines.

67
00:04:23,477 --> 00:04:25,388
I understand that you
hate Terrance and Phillip.

68
00:04:25,517 --> 00:04:26,369
Yes, yes I do.

69
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:29,630
They think that farts are a sophisticated
form of comedy, but they're not.

70
00:04:29,637 --> 00:04:32,834
Well, what if I were to help you
get rid of them once and for all?

71
00:04:32,957 --> 00:04:33,985
Who is this?

72
00:04:34,317 --> 00:04:37,354
Let's just say that I'm someone
who can help you if you help me.

73
00:04:37,477 --> 00:04:42,028
- Just call me your old pal, Saddam Hussein.
- Saddam Hussein, the Iraqi dictator?!?

74
00:04:42,157 --> 00:04:45,567
Hey, relax guy. I'm just your
average Joe. Take a rest.

75
00:04:45,568 --> 00:04:46,568
What do you want?

76
00:04:46,797 --> 00:04:48,461
You want Terrance and
Phillip out of Canada;

77
00:04:48,462 --> 00:04:50,462
I want you to bring me and
my friends into Canada.

78
00:04:50,877 --> 00:04:53,794
That sounds like a fair trade,
doesn't it? Super, let's get started.

79
00:04:53,817 --> 00:04:58,295
- I'm not sure I should trust you.
- Hey, relax guy, trust me.

80
00:05:02,747 --> 00:05:05,519
Well, it's too bad we didn't find any
treasure on the subway Phillip.

81
00:05:06,027 --> 00:05:08,360
- Oh, hello Ugly Bob.
- Hello Terrance, hello Phillip.

82
00:05:08,487 --> 00:05:11,229
- My God, you're looking hideously
ugly today Ugly Bob.

83
00:05:11,230 --> 00:05:12,630
How come you guys
say stuff like that?

84
00:05:12,647 --> 00:05:15,695
- Because you're God Damned
ugly Bob. - I know, but...

85
00:05:15,796 --> 00:05:18,996
Ugly Bob, your face looks like somebody tried
to put out forest fire with a screwdriver.

86
00:05:19,127 --> 00:05:20,336
I can't help how I look.

87
00:05:20,337 --> 00:05:24,037
Besides, it's not what's on the outside
that matters, it's what's on the inside.

88
00:05:24,087 --> 00:05:25,476
No it isn't.

89
00:05:26,607 --> 00:05:28,596
Want to see what's on
the inside of me?

90
00:05:30,487 --> 00:05:32,138
Wait, wait. I've got an idea.

91
00:05:32,139 --> 00:05:34,439
Why don't you put this paper
bag over your head Ugly Bob?

92
00:05:34,527 --> 00:05:38,202
Yes, if people can't see your face, they
won't know how wretchedly ugly you are.

93
00:05:38,327 --> 00:05:41,603
Really? Hey, thanks you guys.
Maybe now I can score with chicks.

94
00:05:41,727 --> 00:05:43,005
Sure you can Ugly Bob.

95
00:05:43,006 --> 00:05:46,006
If they can't see how horribly disfigured
you are, they'll want to sleep with you.

96
00:05:46,127 --> 00:05:47,406
Thanks you guys.

97
00:05:51,087 --> 00:05:52,682
Hello Barky, hello Purry.

98
00:05:53,083 --> 00:05:53,883
Bark Bark.

99
00:05:54,084 --> 00:05:54,784
Purr Purr.

100
00:05:54,927 --> 00:05:57,409
Say, Terrance, I was just aboot
to make some Kroff Dinner.

101
00:05:57,410 --> 00:06:02,210
- Would you like some? - You know I
never turn down Kroff Dinner, Phillip.

102
00:06:02,287 --> 00:06:04,924
I'm going to put on
a pirate costume.

103
00:06:05,727 --> 00:06:08,366
- Special delivery for Terrance.
- I'll take that.

104
00:06:08,487 --> 00:06:12,100
Sign here and here and
here and here and here.

105
00:06:13,807 --> 00:06:17,846
- And here.
- Oh Terrance, you got a letter.

106
00:06:17,967 --> 00:06:21,755
Shiver me timbers Phillip, at this
rate I'll never get to my Kroff Dinner.

107
00:06:21,887 --> 00:06:24,321
- Oh my God!!!
- What is it Terrance? Did you fart?

108
00:06:24,447 --> 00:06:27,200
No, it's Sally, she's being
held captive in Iran.

109
00:06:27,327 --> 00:06:31,081
Not Sally, dear God no Terrance,
why Sally, God why?

110
00:06:31,207 --> 00:06:33,357
- Say Terrance, who's Sally?
- My daughter.

111
00:06:33,487 --> 00:06:37,480
- I never knew you had a daughter, Terrance.
- Oh yes, didn't I mention that me heartys?

112
00:06:37,607 --> 00:06:38,960
No, you never did, Terrance.

113
00:06:39,087 --> 00:06:42,159
Oh, well, it all began
fifteen years ago.

114
00:06:45,327 --> 00:06:48,876
My God, what a fascinating story Terrance,
especially the part aboot Celine Dion.

115
00:06:49,007 --> 00:06:52,391
Yes, indeed. But now my little Sally
is being held captive in Iran,

116
00:06:52,392 --> 00:06:54,102
and I will have to go and find her.

117
00:06:54,127 --> 00:06:56,960
- Then I will go with you Terrance.
- You are such a good friend Phillip.

118
00:06:57,087 --> 00:07:00,285
Well, You know what they say; "A friend
in need is a friend with Kroff Dinner."

119
00:07:00,386 --> 00:07:01,286
Advance there maties.

120
00:07:06,767 --> 00:07:10,396
- Hello Celine Dion.
- Terrance, this is quite a surprise.

121
00:07:10,527 --> 00:07:12,245
- You're looking well.
- And you.

122
00:07:12,367 --> 00:07:14,123
- Celine, where is our
daughter Sally?

123
00:07:14,124 --> 00:07:17,424
She's in the Middle East,
studying anthropology. Why?

124
00:07:17,447 --> 00:07:21,884
- Wrong, she's been taken hostage and is
now being held prisoner. - What?!?

125
00:07:22,007 --> 00:07:25,204
Phillip and I are going to Iran to
find her, but we may never return.

126
00:07:25,567 --> 00:07:29,685
- Oh, Terrance, what happened to us?
- We just grew apart, Celine Dion.

127
00:07:29,807 --> 00:07:33,197
Please, bring our daughter
home safe, Terrance.

128
00:07:38,407 --> 00:07:41,399
- Hello Ugly Bob. - Hi guys.
- How's the paper bag working out?

129
00:07:41,527 --> 00:07:44,024
People seem to really like it.
I even have a date this Friday.

130
00:07:44,147 --> 00:07:46,734
- Terrific. We need two
tickets for Teheran please.

131
00:07:46,735 --> 00:07:48,806
Iran is dangerous;
you guys shouldn't go there.

132
00:07:48,807 --> 00:07:52,358
Damnit man. Danger or no, I'm going
to help my friend find his daughter.

133
00:07:53,487 --> 00:07:55,420
- All right then, there's a
flight leaving today.

134
00:07:55,421 --> 00:07:58,921
Oh good. Well, I certainly am
going to miss Canada, Terrance.

135
00:07:58,927 --> 00:08:00,099
Indeed Phillip.

136
00:08:00,727 --> 00:08:03,911
Terrance, if I die whilst in Iran,
please bring my body back to Canada,

137
00:08:03,912 --> 00:08:06,212
and bury me in a box with
a side of Kroff Dinner.

138
00:08:06,287 --> 00:08:07,436
Same here Phillip.

139
00:08:07,567 --> 00:08:14,598
O Canada! Our home
and native land!

140
00:08:15,367 --> 00:08:18,803
True patriot love

141
00:08:19,207 --> 00:08:23,120
in all thy sons command.

142
00:08:23,447 --> 00:08:27,156
With glowing hearts
we see thee rise,

143
00:08:27,287 --> 00:08:30,836
The True North
strong and free!

144
00:08:30,967 --> 00:08:34,846
From far and wide,
O Canada,

145
00:08:34,967 --> 00:08:39,438
we stand on
guard for thee.

146
00:08:39,567 --> 00:08:43,162
God keep our land

147
00:08:44,247 --> 00:08:46,363
Scott to Red Dragon,
come in Red Dragon.

148
00:08:46,487 --> 00:08:48,364
Go-ahead guy,
this is Red Dragon.

149
00:08:48,487 --> 00:08:51,240
The plan is working perfectly;
Terrance and Phillip are taking the bait.

150
00:08:51,367 --> 00:08:54,176
Excellent, my buddies and I
are ready to come to Canada.

151
00:08:54,177 --> 00:08:55,600
Has everything been arranged?

152
00:08:55,607 --> 00:08:57,474
Yes, everything's proceeding
according to plan.

153
00:08:57,475 --> 00:08:59,375
Now, you promised that when
Terrance and Phillip arrive

154
00:08:59,376 --> 00:09:01,506
they'll be ripped into pieces
and shot several times.

155
00:09:01,527 --> 00:09:04,564
Hey, relax guy, I'm gonna
keep my side of the bargain.

156
00:09:04,687 --> 00:09:09,363
Roger Red Dragon, Scott out. I've got
you now you fart loving fart lovers.

157
00:09:15,527 --> 00:09:17,404
I got you.

158
00:09:19,647 --> 00:09:21,683
Sprayed your face.

159
00:09:27,407 --> 00:09:31,002
Oh Phillip, how will I ever find my
fugitive daughter in this daunting place?

160
00:09:31,127 --> 00:09:33,233
We don't speak the language,
we are unwelcome strangers

161
00:09:33,234 --> 00:09:35,234
and we have no
idea where to begin.

162
00:09:35,287 --> 00:09:37,198
Oh look, there she is.

163
00:09:37,327 --> 00:09:39,045
- Oh good.
- Who, where?

164
00:09:39,167 --> 00:09:41,226
I'm here Sally;
it's your father, Terrance.

165
00:09:41,227 --> 00:09:43,227
I'm here to save you from
your smelly Iranian captors.

166
00:09:43,327 --> 00:09:47,161
- Papa. - Say, she looks a lot more
like Celine Dion than you Terrance.

167
00:09:47,287 --> 00:09:50,723
- Oh, now I see the resemblance.
- Well, enough of Iran, let's get home.

168
00:09:56,287 --> 00:09:58,276
Well, now that I've got my
bastard daughter back,

169
00:09:58,277 --> 00:10:01,677
I feel like going to Celine Dion's house
and asking her to marry me again.

170
00:10:01,767 --> 00:10:03,918
- Oh, raspberries, looks
like I'm losing a friend.

171
00:10:03,919 --> 00:10:05,219
No, you're gaining
a pop vocalist.

172
00:10:05,647 --> 00:10:07,763
Oh my God!
What is this?!?

173
00:10:09,647 --> 00:10:12,876
- Is this Canada?
- It seems to have changed.

174
00:10:13,407 --> 00:10:15,079
This is madness!

175
00:10:18,407 --> 00:10:19,819
What's going on Phillip?

176
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:22,000
How could Canada have changed
so much whilst we were gone?

177
00:10:22,007 --> 00:10:25,317
I don't know Terrance. And who is
that smelly person in all these pictures?

178
00:10:25,447 --> 00:10:28,326
I must take my bastard daughter back
to Celine Dion and see what she has to say.

179
00:10:33,487 --> 00:10:36,285
Celine, I brought our daughter Sally
back, and I want to tell you that...

180
00:10:36,407 --> 00:10:38,921
Terrance, uh, could you
come back a little later?

181
00:10:39,047 --> 00:10:41,845
- Why? - Uh, I'm just
a little busy right now.

182
00:10:41,967 --> 00:10:44,276
You've got a man over,
don't you Celine Dion?

183
00:10:44,407 --> 00:10:46,079
- Well, I...
- Hi guys.

184
00:10:46,207 --> 00:10:48,944
- Oh my God, it's Ugly Bob!
- What the hell are you doing here?

185
00:10:49,067 --> 00:10:50,738
I'm doing Celine Dion,
what's it look like?

186
00:10:50,867 --> 00:10:52,349
Oh Celine Dion, what
have you done?

187
00:10:52,350 --> 00:10:55,340
I was going to make us a family again,
but now you've slept with Ugly Bob.

188
00:10:55,347 --> 00:10:57,523
- What do you mean? Why are
you calling him Ugly Bob?

189
00:10:57,524 --> 00:10:59,324
Because that's his
name you stupid bitch.

190
00:10:59,387 --> 00:11:03,080
- You told me your name was Handsome
Bob. - Look at him Celine Dion.

191
00:11:04,807 --> 00:11:06,470
Behold, his horrible face.

192
00:11:06,471 --> 00:11:10,471
Oh my God, he's heinously ugly,
and I am pregnant with his child!

193
00:11:10,507 --> 00:11:14,222
- What?!? Noooooo!!!!!!
- I'm going to have a freak-baby!

194
00:11:14,323 --> 00:11:15,423
Oh, the humanity!

195
00:11:19,567 --> 00:11:21,780
Hey Saddam, you helped me
get rid of Terrance and Phillip,

196
00:11:21,781 --> 00:11:22,781
and I appreciate that.

197
00:11:22,782 --> 00:11:25,282
But why are framed pictures of
you going up all over Canada?

198
00:11:25,387 --> 00:11:28,265
Huh, oh that? Don't worry
guy, you just need a rest.

199
00:11:28,687 --> 00:11:31,360
No, I don't need a rest! I want
to know what this is all aboot.

200
00:11:31,487 --> 00:11:33,616
Hey, relax fella, I'm just making
it so that Terrance and Phillip

201
00:11:33,617 --> 00:11:35,517
an never come back
to Canada again.

202
00:11:35,607 --> 00:11:37,725
- I just need a couple of days,
then I'm gonna head back to Iran.

203
00:11:37,726 --> 00:11:39,326
I thought you were from Iraq.

204
00:11:39,487 --> 00:11:41,921
Iran, Iraq, what the hell's
the difference? Relax guy.

205
00:11:47,527 --> 00:11:50,720
Phillip, I'm convinced that something very,
very not good is happening to Canada.

206
00:11:50,721 --> 00:11:54,121
Yes, I agree whole-fartedly.

207
00:11:54,487 --> 00:11:57,577
- Hey, what the hell are you guys
doing here? - Oh, hello Scott.

208
00:11:57,607 --> 00:11:58,639
You're not supposed to be here.

209
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:00,640
You're supposed to be in Iran
looking for your kidnapped...

210
00:12:00,641 --> 00:12:03,241
Uh, I mean, how
are you guys today?

211
00:12:03,307 --> 00:12:05,343
- Wait, what were you saying?
- Nothing, why?

212
00:12:05,467 --> 00:12:07,161
- Hey Scott, guess what?
- What?

213
00:12:09,147 --> 00:12:13,523
I hate you more than ever Terrance
and Phillip. I absolutely abhor you both.

214
00:12:15,087 --> 00:12:17,701
- What are you doing Scott?
- I'm wishing cancer upon you.

215
00:12:17,727 --> 00:12:20,878
- Cancer? - That's right, I'm trying
to give you cancer with my mind.

216
00:12:21,007 --> 00:12:25,223
- Ah, stop that.
- Hey, don't give me cancer.

217
00:12:29,001 --> 00:12:31,701
Mr. Hussein, the U.S. Government
is becoming worried.

218
00:12:31,802 --> 00:12:33,902
Worried, aboot what?
Take a load off, relax.

219
00:12:34,327 --> 00:12:38,061
- You seem to be taking over Canada.
- Taking over Canada? Me?

220
00:12:38,187 --> 00:12:41,065
Hey, you need a rest fella.
I'm not hiding any bombs.

221
00:12:41,287 --> 00:12:45,385
- We didn't say anything about bombs.
- Oh. You didn't? Hey, relax.

222
00:12:45,607 --> 00:12:48,497
We're giving you just three years
to clear your forces out of Canada.

223
00:12:48,498 --> 00:12:50,298
After that, we're going
to bomb all of Iran.

224
00:12:50,387 --> 00:12:52,981
- I'm from Iraq.
- Iran, Iraq, what's the difference.

225
00:12:54,367 --> 00:12:59,025
- Uh, I hate Americans, please let me
kill them! - No, no, you need to relax guy.

226
00:12:59,047 --> 00:13:01,099
Remember the plan; first
we take over Canada,

227
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:03,400
then we'll have the best
of the female pop vocalists.

228
00:13:03,487 --> 00:13:05,719
After that we'll take over
the U.S., then Europe,

229
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:08,920
then China, then Newfoundland,
then the world!

230
00:13:09,147 --> 00:13:11,302
- What's so funny?
- Nothing, relax buddy.

231
00:13:11,327 --> 00:13:14,624
- Saddam, Terrance and Phillip are
back in Canada. - Oh, really?

232
00:13:15,047 --> 00:13:17,545
You promised me they'd be gone for good.
That was your part of the bargain.

233
00:13:17,667 --> 00:13:20,640
I changed my mind. Pray that
I don't change it any further.

234
00:13:22,607 --> 00:13:24,337
This deal's getting
worse all the time.

235
00:13:27,047 --> 00:13:29,363
Hey Terrance, let's watch
American television.

236
00:13:29,364 --> 00:13:34,004
Yes, we can get satellite feed from the U.S.
and watch all their stupid TV shows.

237
00:13:34,021 --> 00:13:36,021
Oh look, here's a show.

238
00:13:37,865 --> 00:13:40,565
- Stupid. - God damn
their TV shows are lame.

239
00:13:41,087 --> 00:13:42,937
The father of Eric
Cartman is indeed...

240
00:13:44,047 --> 00:13:47,535
- Look at their silly American heads.
- They look like groundhogs.

241
00:13:48,767 --> 00:13:51,298
And in other news, it appears that
Saddam Hussein has finally signed

242
00:13:51,299 --> 00:13:54,199
an agreement to let the U.S.
inspect his military operations.

243
00:13:54,287 --> 00:13:56,798
When asked if he would uphold
his side of the agreement,

244
00:13:56,799 --> 00:14:00,799
Hussein replied quote "Hey, relax
fella, you need a rest guy."

245
00:14:01,107 --> 00:14:04,279
Hey Phillip, isn't that the smelly gentleman
we've seen in pictures all over town?

246
00:14:04,407 --> 00:14:08,259
Yes, it is Terrance. According to that
newsy he's some kind of Turkish dictator.

247
00:14:08,387 --> 00:14:12,016
Well, we can't just sit here and eat Kroff
dinner and let Canada be overrun by the Turks.

248
00:14:14,827 --> 00:14:18,456
- That fart sounded like a ringing
phone Terrance. - It sure did, Phillip.

249
00:14:20,067 --> 00:14:22,076
Oh wait, that is the phone.

250
00:14:22,907 --> 00:14:24,738
- Hello.
- Terrance, this is Scott.

251
00:14:24,867 --> 00:14:28,177
- Oh, hey, it's Scott.
- Tell him he's a smelly bastard.

252
00:14:28,307 --> 00:14:30,457
- Phillip says 'hello' Scott.
- Just shut up and listen.

253
00:14:30,687 --> 00:14:33,822
You've unleashed a monster unto
Canada and only you can get rid of him,

254
00:14:33,823 --> 00:14:35,523
even though I hate you and
I wish you had cancer.

255
00:14:35,667 --> 00:14:37,897
- You are such a dick Scott.
- You're a dick.

256
00:14:38,027 --> 00:14:41,781
- You're a dick.
- You're a dick.

257
00:14:43,107 --> 00:14:44,665
- You're a dick.
- You're a dick.

258
00:14:44,987 --> 00:14:46,899
The two of you are the most
annoying dicks in Canada.

259
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:48,900
You give other Canadians a bad
name, and if I had my way....

260
00:14:48,987 --> 00:14:52,255
- Oh, I'm sorry Scott, can you
hold on a minute? - Sure.

261
00:14:53,927 --> 00:14:57,317
- How do you like that Scott? - You son of
a bitch, I'll get you if it's the last thing...

262
00:14:57,447 --> 00:15:00,559
- Oh wait, I have another call Scott.
Can you hang on? - Sure.

263
00:15:01,467 --> 00:15:04,425
Oh, that was very smelly.
He says hello.

264
00:15:04,547 --> 00:15:06,105
- God damn it.
- Oh, wait a second Scott.

265
00:15:06,227 --> 00:15:08,626
Sure. I mean no.
You listen to me,

266
00:15:08,627 --> 00:15:10,415
if you want to save Canada
you'll meet me at

267
00:15:10,416 --> 00:15:12,416
at Karl's Kroff Dinner
restaurant in half-an-hour.

268
00:15:14,927 --> 00:15:20,021
Oh Ugly Bob, I'm so confused. I love your
personality, but you are so wretchedly ugly.

269
00:15:20,147 --> 00:15:22,525
- Maybe the baby will have
your face instead of mine.

270
00:15:22,526 --> 00:15:26,138
We can only hope. I suppose we'll be ok as
long as you keep that bag on your head.

271
00:15:27,707 --> 00:15:28,986
What's this?!?

272
00:15:29,307 --> 00:15:31,749
Hey there, my name's Saddam.
I'm a big fan of polo.

273
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:33,550
I've been searching a long
time for you Celine Dion.

274
00:15:33,747 --> 00:15:36,261
- Oh no, you don't, she's my bitch.
- Hey, who are you?

275
00:15:36,487 --> 00:15:38,088
I'm Bob, but my friends
call me Ugly Bob

276
00:15:38,089 --> 00:15:40,009
because I have the features
of a deformed burn victim.

277
00:15:40,047 --> 00:15:43,017
Really, I thought all Canadians
looked alike. Let me see.

278
00:15:45,467 --> 00:15:48,455
Wow, I'm sorry guy. You know,
I could cure that face of yours.

279
00:15:48,587 --> 00:15:50,383
- You could?
- Sure, I just need a favor.

280
00:15:50,498 --> 00:15:51,855
There's a Candian football
game tomorrow;

281
00:15:51,856 --> 00:15:54,006
the Ottawa Rough-Riders against
the Vancouver Roughriders.

282
00:15:54,027 --> 00:15:57,656
It's at that game that I will officialy turn
the Candian flag over to my Iranian one.

283
00:15:57,987 --> 00:16:00,309
- What?!? Why?!?
- Hey, don't worry about that.

284
00:16:00,310 --> 00:16:02,510
Take a load off. Don't think
about it. Look over here.

285
00:16:02,667 --> 00:16:05,973
All I need is for Celine Dion to sing our
Iranian national anthem at the game,

286
00:16:05,974 --> 00:16:08,624
to finalize my hostile takeover
of Canada. Whaddaya say?

287
00:16:08,627 --> 00:16:12,381
- Did you say 'hostile takeover of
Canada? - No, no, relax there fella.

288
00:16:17,727 --> 00:16:20,300
Well, Scott said to meet him here,
but he's not showing up.

289
00:16:22,507 --> 00:16:25,178
Well, while we're waiting, why
don't we search for treasure?

290
00:16:25,179 --> 00:16:27,279
Oh, good idea.
Let's search for treasure.

291
00:16:30,427 --> 00:16:32,461
- What are you idiot's doing?
- We're looking for treasure.

292
00:16:32,587 --> 00:16:35,545
Is that some kind of metaphor for a
kind of search that can't be described?

293
00:16:36,427 --> 00:16:39,624
- No, we're searching for treasure.
- Listen, I have an inside scoop.

294
00:16:39,747 --> 00:16:43,217
There's an Iraqi dictator who is
quietly and slowly taking over Canada.

295
00:16:43,347 --> 00:16:45,900
- Yes, you mean Saddam Smelly.
We saw him on the telly.

296
00:16:45,901 --> 00:16:47,581
Well, what are you two
going to do aboot it?

297
00:16:47,587 --> 00:16:49,543
- What do you mean?
- It's your fault that he's here.

298
00:16:49,667 --> 00:16:52,141
You brought the Iraqis back
with you on your plane,

299
00:16:52,142 --> 00:16:53,980
when you rescued your
kidnapped daughter.

300
00:16:53,987 --> 00:16:57,065
- You mean we are to blame? - That's
right, and now you must make amends.

301
00:16:57,187 --> 00:17:00,084
Tomorrow, Saddam will try to
finalize his takeover of Canada

302
00:17:00,085 --> 00:17:01,985
at the Rough-Riders
Rough-Riders football game.

303
00:17:01,987 --> 00:17:05,775
- It will be your only shot at wiping them
all out. - Here, take this. - What is this?

304
00:17:05,907 --> 00:17:07,989
It's a bomb. You must
strap it to yourselves,

305
00:17:07,990 --> 00:17:11,290
go to the game and sacrifice your
lives to take out Saddam's minions.

306
00:17:11,347 --> 00:17:14,419
- That sounds scary.
- Well, you must do it for Canada.

307
00:17:14,547 --> 00:17:17,300
- For Canada, Terrance.
- For Canada, Phillip.

308
00:17:18,547 --> 00:17:20,982
Yes, Terrance and Phillip,
and when the dust is settled

309
00:17:20,983 --> 00:17:24,983
Canada will be rid of both the Iraqis
and your immature fart humor.

310
00:17:29,527 --> 00:17:32,079
Well, Phillip, I'm very sad that
we have to die for Canada.

311
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:34,827
Yes, this bomb will blow
us both to smithereens.

312
00:17:34,827 --> 00:17:38,456
But we really have no choice.
Only our deaths can bring Canada life.

313
00:17:40,667 --> 00:17:43,540
- That's smelly. - Wait a minute,
Terrance, that fart gives me pause.

314
00:17:43,541 --> 00:17:44,541
Why is that?

315
00:17:44,867 --> 00:17:47,961
That smelly Saddam Hussein, he uses
germ and chemical warfare, does he not?

316
00:17:47,987 --> 00:17:49,716
-Yes, apparently he does.

317
00:17:49,717 --> 00:17:53,117
Terrance, get the phone book,
we must call every Canadian we can.

318
00:17:53,187 --> 00:17:56,862
- Oh, Phillip, it sounds like you have
an idea. - I do Terrance.

319
00:18:02,947 --> 00:18:06,019
And the Rough-Riders are really giving
the Roughriders a run for their money.

320
00:18:06,147 --> 00:18:08,393
All else aside, I must say
that the Rough-Riders

321
00:18:08,394 --> 00:18:10,394
are simply outmatched
by these Roughriders.

322
00:18:13,527 --> 00:18:15,164
And that's going to
take us to half-time.

323
00:18:15,165 --> 00:18:17,062
Be sure to stick around
for the half-time show

324
00:18:17,063 --> 00:18:20,803
Saddam and the Electric Iraqis and
a salute to hostile takeovers.

325
00:18:25,627 --> 00:18:29,302
- Well, I guess it's time old friend.
- Yes, prepare the alert.

326
00:18:30,987 --> 00:18:33,978
Hello to my Canadian friends.
Everybody relax, take a rest,

327
00:18:33,979 --> 00:18:36,979
put your feet up 'cause
those dogs are barking.

328
00:18:37,147 --> 00:18:39,083
You may have noticed some
changes to your country.

329
00:18:39,084 --> 00:18:41,060
Don't worry about that,
the changes will continue.

330
00:18:41,067 --> 00:18:43,423
I'm here to announce once
and for all that Canada

331
00:18:43,424 --> 00:18:46,424
will now be known as New
Baghdad. Kalookh Kalakh!

332
00:18:51,667 --> 00:18:57,139
You will bow down to me as your ruler.
You will obey my laws or you will be killed.

333
00:18:57,267 --> 00:19:01,180
And now you will sing the Iraqi national
anthem, or you will be stabbed in the head.

334
00:19:02,191 --> 00:19:04,843
Shtut malakh shtut,
inka inka bruscht.

335
00:19:04,867 --> 00:19:07,700
- Now Phillip?
- Now Terrance.

336
00:19:12,587 --> 00:19:14,782
Hey, what the hell is this?

337
00:19:14,783 --> 00:19:16,697
Frakh o shtut koolakh koolakh a shtut.

338
00:19:23,987 --> 00:19:26,455
They're using chemical warfare,
how could they?

339
00:19:37,987 --> 00:19:42,458
- We did it Phillip, we destroyed
the Turks. - Oh, glorious day.

340
00:19:51,347 --> 00:19:55,420
- Terrance, Terrance, you've saved
Canada. - Oh, it was all Phillips idea.

341
00:19:55,547 --> 00:19:57,856
- God bless you Phillip.
- Don't touch me Ugly Bob.

342
00:19:57,987 --> 00:20:00,740
Hey, what the hell happened,
you were supposed to be blown up.

343
00:20:00,867 --> 00:20:02,069
We came up with a better plan.

344
00:20:02,070 --> 00:20:05,970
You see Scott, after all your criticism,
it was farting that saved Canada.

345
00:20:06,107 --> 00:20:09,220
- Oh, that is so juvenile.
- Hey Scott, do you like apples?

346
00:20:09,321 --> 00:20:10,621
Of course.

347
00:20:11,027 --> 00:20:12,797
How do you like them apples?

348
00:20:13,227 --> 00:20:15,787
I hate you Terrance and Phillip!!!

349
00:20:16,987 --> 00:20:19,731
- Oh Celine Dion, you never
finished that national anthem.

350
00:20:19,732 --> 00:20:22,732
You're right Terrance,
you're right.

351
00:20:22,827 --> 00:20:27,025
O Canada! Our home
and native land!

352
00:20:27,147 --> 00:20:30,662
True patriot love

353
00:20:30,787 --> 00:20:34,700
in all thy sons command.

354
00:20:34,827 --> 00:20:38,706
With glowing hearts
we see thee rise,

355
00:20:38,827 --> 00:20:42,263
The True North
strong and free!

356
00:20:42,387 --> 00:20:45,982
From far and wide,
O Canada,

357
00:20:46,107 --> 00:20:50,259
we stand on guard for thee.

358
00:20:50,787 --> 00:20:54,462
God keep our land

359
00:20:54,947 --> 00:20:59,020
glorious and free!

360
00:20:59,347 --> 00:21:07,345
O Canada, we stand
on guard for thee.

361
00:21:07,747 --> 00:21:15,620
O Canada, we stand
on guard for thee.

362
00:21:25,521 --> 00:21:27,921
Who is Cartman's Father?

363
00:21:28,122 --> 00:21:31,922
Find out on an all new South Park,
in just a few weeks.
