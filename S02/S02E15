1
00:00:04,801 --> 00:00:07,701
The following program is brought
to you in Spooky Vision.

2
00:00:07,702 --> 00:00:12,002
Be warned, all scenes will be accompanied
by pictures of Barbara Streisand.

3
00:01:17,527 --> 00:01:19,258
I wonder why Cartman
wasn't in school today?

4
00:01:19,259 --> 00:01:21,359
He probably just ditched
to avoid that spelling test.

5
00:01:21,407 --> 00:01:22,965
Hey guys, how's it going?

6
00:01:23,087 --> 00:01:26,124
Oh nice costume dude, who're ya
supposed to be, Luke Perry?

7
00:01:26,247 --> 00:01:27,247
Cartman, how come you
weren't in school today?

8
00:01:27,248 --> 00:01:30,248
Did you eat to many
pork-rinds last night?

9
00:01:30,527 --> 00:01:32,696
You guys, you're so funny.

10
00:01:32,697 --> 00:01:37,097
No matter how I'm feelin' I can always
count on you guys to lighten me up.

11
00:01:37,167 --> 00:01:40,239
- What?  - I had to stay home today
because my mother wasn't feeling well.

12
00:01:40,367 --> 00:01:44,599
She has the flu and I wanted to take care
of the house so she could stay in bed.

13
00:01:45,487 --> 00:01:49,400
I just wanted to catch you guys to see if
we were assigned any homework tonight.

14
00:01:50,087 --> 00:01:51,725
What the hell are you
talkin' about Cartman?

15
00:01:51,847 --> 00:01:55,237
Stop screwin' around dude. We're all gonna go
meet at the store later to buy pumpkins to carve.

16
00:01:55,367 --> 00:01:56,581
Oh, then we can enter
the carving contest.

17
00:01:56,582 --> 00:02:01,582
I'll run home and get money from
mother, do you guys need some to?

18
00:02:03,687 --> 00:02:05,166
Dude this is creepy.

19
00:02:06,647 --> 00:02:08,956
Stanley, look who's here, Aunt Flo.

20
00:02:09,087 --> 00:02:11,601
- Hello Stanley, remember me?
- Hi Aunt Flo.

21
00:02:11,727 --> 00:02:14,844
Now Stanley, Aunt Flo only
visits once a month. Be nice.

22
00:02:14,967 --> 00:02:19,324
- Hey Stanley, I brought you and Shelly
presents.- Wow really! Hey I love aunt, Flo.

23
00:02:19,447 --> 00:02:22,200
OK, Shelly, this one's for you.

24
00:02:23,687 --> 00:02:27,043
It's a television, CD player,
surround sound home theater.

25
00:02:27,167 --> 00:02:30,318
- What do you say Shelly?
- Thank you, Aunt Flo.

26
00:02:31,207 --> 00:02:33,721
OK Stanley, your turn.

27
00:02:35,447 --> 00:02:38,007
Your very own fish!

28
00:02:38,127 --> 00:02:40,766
- What do you say Stanley?
- I don't know?

29
00:02:44,047 --> 00:02:48,325
I think he likes it. C'mon Shelly
let's hook up your home theater.

30
00:02:48,447 --> 00:02:51,405
- How do you like your fish Stanley?
- I don't like it. It's spooky.

31
00:02:51,527 --> 00:02:55,759
Oh now what's so spooky about a cute
little goldfish. Go put him in your room.

32
00:02:55,887 --> 00:02:57,479
- Do I have to?
- Yes you do.

33
00:02:57,607 --> 00:02:59,643
- Dammit!
- Language!

34
00:03:00,167 --> 00:03:03,364
- Where've you been, dude? - Dude,
my mom's having her monthly visitor.

35
00:03:03,487 --> 00:03:06,957
- Aunt Flo? - Ya. Every time she shows
up my mom turns into a total bitch.

36
00:03:07,087 --> 00:03:09,486
Where's Cartman? He's said he was gonna
bring money for us to buy a pumpkin.

37
00:03:09,487 --> 00:03:11,187
Ya I wonder why
he's being so nice.

38
00:03:11,247 --> 00:03:13,807
- Here he comes. - Hey Cartman, did
you bring us money from your mom?

39
00:03:13,927 --> 00:03:18,079
- Heh. Ya right you guys can kiss my black ass.
- You said you could get us money Cartman.

40
00:03:18,207 --> 00:03:21,677
Man you guys are hella-stupid. If I had
money I wouldn't give it to you ass holes.

41
00:03:22,487 --> 00:03:24,015
Well at least he's back to normal.

42
00:03:24,016 --> 00:03:26,816
Ya but we can't get a pumpkin so we
can't enter the carving contest.

43
00:03:26,927 --> 00:03:30,397
- It's OK. Kenny said he could get one. - Oh,
how's Kenny gonna get one? He's hella-poor.

44
00:03:30,527 --> 00:03:33,564
- Why do you keep saying hella fat ass?
- Cause I'm hella-cool that's why.

45
00:03:33,687 --> 00:03:36,724
- That's not cool!
- You guys are just hella-jealous.

46
00:03:39,127 --> 00:03:42,403
- Good night Stanley. We'll-a see you in the
morning. - Can you leave the light on, dad?

47
00:03:42,527 --> 00:03:45,997
Well it has to be off or your Aunt Flo
will complain about wasting electricity.

48
00:03:46,127 --> 00:03:48,925
- I wish Aunt Flo didn't have
to visit now. - Ya, me too,

49
00:03:49,047 --> 00:03:52,722
but she only visits your mom for five days
or so. I'll be out sleeping on the couch.

50
00:04:20,367 --> 00:04:22,005
Where'd he go?

51
00:04:44,127 --> 00:04:45,126
Give me this.

52
00:04:45,127 --> 00:04:47,482
Kenny you share that
blanket with your brother?

53
00:04:48,167 --> 00:04:50,476
Who the hell could that be?

54
00:04:50,607 --> 00:04:53,048
Hi there folks. This is a
heck of a storm out here.

55
00:04:53,049 --> 00:04:55,249
Thought maybe you could
use some provisions?

56
00:04:55,367 --> 00:04:57,920
There's some candles and food in
there. Ain't much but it should get

57
00:04:57,921 --> 00:05:00,868
you through the night. Take care folks
I've got other houses to get to.

58
00:05:01,647 --> 00:05:06,641
Kenny, wasn't that your fat, racist,
foul-mouth friend Eric Cartman?

59
00:05:12,727 --> 00:05:15,844
Hey, where'd the shirt go?

60
00:05:15,967 --> 00:05:18,879
I covered you with
a shirt, where'd it go?

61
00:05:27,287 --> 00:05:30,085
I'm not gonna look.

62
00:05:31,647 --> 00:05:34,957
It's not closer.
I'm just seeing things.

63
00:05:40,047 --> 00:05:43,562
- Mom! Mom!
- Stanley, settle down.

64
00:05:43,687 --> 00:05:46,963
- Look he's gonna kill me mom.
- Is there a problem?

65
00:05:47,087 --> 00:05:50,124
- Oh, no problem Aunt Flo.
- Do you not like your goldfish?

66
00:05:50,247 --> 00:05:52,636
- No!
- I'm sorry I'm a bad Aunt.

67
00:05:52,767 --> 00:05:56,999
There, there Aunt Flo.
Stanley loves his goldfish.

68
00:06:22,167 --> 00:06:25,125
- Stanley, what are you doing?
- The fish! But…

69
00:06:26,407 --> 00:06:28,557
Stanley I am in no mood for this

70
00:06:28,687 --> 00:06:32,475
not when your Aunt Flo is in town.
Oh look you woke your sister up.

71
00:06:35,447 --> 00:06:37,756
Go to sleep Stanley!

72
00:06:53,167 --> 00:06:54,725
Mom!!

73
00:06:54,847 --> 00:06:58,362
Alright! Stanley, I have had enough of…

74
00:06:59,407 --> 00:07:02,221
Oh Stanley what have you done
baby? What have you done?

75
00:07:02,222 --> 00:07:04,322
Mom, I was just sleeping
and the next thing I knew…

76
00:07:04,447 --> 00:07:09,441
Shh, It's OK hun it's OK. Your such
a good boy, mommy's little angel.

77
00:07:10,287 --> 00:07:15,441
Now don't worry Stanley mommy's gonna hide
the body. Nobody's gonna take my baby away.

78
00:07:15,567 --> 00:07:19,401
I've got such a handsome
boy, such a good boy.

79
00:07:20,207 --> 00:07:22,038
You're not gonna get away with this.

80
00:07:37,887 --> 00:07:40,401
- Sharon! - Ah! Aunt Flo,
what are you doing up?

81
00:07:40,527 --> 00:07:43,883
Look at you with your little shovel,
just like when you were twelve.

82
00:07:44,007 --> 00:07:47,238
- Mom what are you doing?
- It's going to be OK, Stanley.

83
00:07:47,367 --> 00:07:51,645
Mom, you think I killed that guy.
It was the fish. He says I'm next.

84
00:07:51,767 --> 00:07:55,396
- You get some sleep baby mommy's
taken care of everything. - But mom…

85
00:07:55,527 --> 00:08:00,555
Hush little baby don't say a word,
mommy's gonna buy you a mocking bird.

86
00:08:00,687 --> 00:08:04,760
If that mocking bird don't sing mommy's
gonna bury it in the back yard.

87
00:08:13,767 --> 00:08:16,281
- Mom!!
- What is it honey?

88
00:08:16,407 --> 00:08:18,967
- My baby's killed again!
- No Mom…

89
00:08:19,087 --> 00:08:21,317
What are we gonna do baby?
What're we gonna do?

90
00:08:21,447 --> 00:08:25,725
I've got such a handsome
boy such a good boy.

91
00:08:29,967 --> 00:08:32,481
It's about time Kenny did
you bring the pumpkin?

92
00:08:32,607 --> 00:08:35,041
Well where is it?

93
00:08:35,167 --> 00:08:37,566
- What the hell is that?!
- It's all I could afford.

94
00:08:37,567 --> 00:08:41,242
It's all you could afford? Who ever heard of a
squash-o-lantern Kenny. That's hella-stupid.

95
00:08:41,367 --> 00:08:44,484
Stop saying hella Cartman. How are we
gonna win the contest with a squash?

96
00:08:44,607 --> 00:08:48,486
- Whoa Stan you don't look so good.
- I haven't been sleeping so well.

97
00:08:51,887 --> 00:08:54,720
God I hate you Kenny.

98
00:08:54,847 --> 00:08:57,645
- I have to get another knife this
one's hella-dull. - God will you shut-up!

99
00:08:57,767 --> 00:09:00,600
Kyle, You know how some
people are murderers and stuff?

100
00:09:00,687 --> 00:09:03,201
- Do you think animals could be
murderers too? - I don't know.

101
00:09:04,967 --> 00:09:07,143
Oh great he's got that
stupid beard on again.

102
00:09:07,144 --> 00:09:10,344
No Kenny, you should cut with the blade facing
away from you. Your gonna hurt yourself.

103
00:09:10,407 --> 00:09:14,958
There you go. Isn't this fun you guys.
Carving pumpkins for Halloween.

104
00:09:15,087 --> 00:09:18,397
You guys are my best friends,
through thick and thin

105
00:09:18,527 --> 00:09:22,122
we've always been together. We're
four of a kind having fun all day,

106
00:09:22,247 --> 00:09:24,556
pallin' around and
laughin' away.

107
00:09:24,687 --> 00:09:27,884
Just best friends,
Best friends are weeee!

108
00:09:28,007 --> 00:09:29,998
I love you guys.

109
00:09:33,087 --> 00:09:35,203
- You seem tired Stan.
- I haven't been sleeping well.

110
00:09:35,367 --> 00:09:38,677
- Why? - My pet goldfish killed
another random person last night.

111
00:09:38,807 --> 00:09:42,277
- Oh, that sucks dude. - Hey dudes.
Man it's hella-cold out here.

112
00:09:42,407 --> 00:09:45,399
- Cartman? - Who'd you expect Moury
Povich? God, you're hella-lame.

113
00:09:45,527 --> 00:09:47,437
- What're you doing? - What do
you mean what am I doing?

114
00:09:47,438 --> 00:09:49,038
I'm just standing here.
Jesus, mellow out you guys.

115
00:09:49,167 --> 00:09:51,601
- You can't be standing their Cartman.
- Why the hell not?

116
00:09:51,727 --> 00:09:54,161
Because you're standing over there!

117
00:09:54,287 --> 00:09:57,757
- Ah, son of a bitch!
- Well you don't see this every day.

118
00:09:57,887 --> 00:10:01,118
- I can't believe what I'm seeing.
- It's like I'm looking at a mirror.

119
00:10:01,247 --> 00:10:02,726
Dude, this is hella-weird.

120
00:10:04,607 --> 00:10:08,156
Oh, Officer Barbrady, wh-what a
surprise. What can I do for you?

121
00:10:08,287 --> 00:10:11,916
- Well there's been a report of a
few missing people. - Is that so?

122
00:10:12,047 --> 00:10:15,960
Ya, no biggie but I was wondering
if you've seen any of them?

123
00:10:17,407 --> 00:10:21,036
- I've never seen any of those men,
Officer Barbrady. - No, I didn't think so.

124
00:10:21,167 --> 00:10:24,318
Mind if I look around
the backyard though?

125
00:10:24,447 --> 00:10:27,200
- Why would you want to do that?
- Well I'm checking everyone's back yard.

126
00:10:27,327 --> 00:10:31,366
Missing people usually end up
hiding in someone's bushes. May I?

127
00:10:38,167 --> 00:10:41,557
Well this all looks all…
Did I miss anyone?

128
00:10:42,687 --> 00:10:45,997
Nobody's gonna take my
baby away from me. Nobody!

129
00:10:46,127 --> 00:10:49,915
OK Ms. Marsh. I'm afraid I'm gonna
have to ask you a few questions.

130
00:10:51,847 --> 00:10:53,565
- Hello there children.
- Hey Chef.

131
00:10:53,687 --> 00:10:58,761
All ready for a Halloween lunch? Today I've
got spooky spaghetti with freaky French fries…

132
00:10:58,887 --> 00:11:01,481
…or haunted hashbrown…

133
00:11:01,607 --> 00:11:07,542
…and a creepy cookie and monstrous
milk… …and a terrifying napkin.

134
00:11:07,967 --> 00:11:09,923
- We have problems!
- Well, what's the first problem?

135
00:11:10,047 --> 00:11:14,996
- Chef, I have a goldfish that keeps killing people.
- Well, don't worry Stan I'm sure it'll work out.

136
00:11:15,127 --> 00:11:17,163
Now, what's the other problem?

137
00:11:18,807 --> 00:11:22,561
Oh No. Oh dear God no!

138
00:11:22,687 --> 00:11:25,992
…and I showed up at the bus stop and
this son of a bitch is standing there.

139
00:11:25,993 --> 00:11:27,593
I'm sorry, I've caused
so much trouble.

140
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:30,838
- This is very strange to me too.
- Exactly what do you remember?

141
00:11:30,967 --> 00:11:34,697
Well, I was just standing around and
Stan and Kyle were being really mean

142
00:11:34,698 --> 00:11:36,498
as usual and Kenny had
just bought a new car.

143
00:11:36,567 --> 00:11:38,205
- Of course, that's it.
- What?

144
00:11:38,327 --> 00:11:42,147
Don't you see children? This Cartman
is from an evil parallel universe

145
00:11:42,148 --> 00:11:44,048
where every thing exists
as its opposite.

146
00:11:44,087 --> 00:11:46,597
He's my evil twin? But he doesn't
even look that much like me.

147
00:11:46,598 --> 00:11:48,598
He's all fat and stuff.
He's hella-lying.

148
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:50,279
Will you stop saying that word!

149
00:11:50,407 --> 00:11:53,524
Of course. My pet goldfish must be
from the evil opposite universe too!

150
00:11:53,647 --> 00:11:55,586
Children, somewhere in South Park

151
00:11:55,587 --> 00:11:58,587
something has created a door
to the evil parallel universe.

152
00:11:58,647 --> 00:12:02,196
- This is amazing. I can't believe how
nice you are Chef. - How do you mean?

153
00:12:02,327 --> 00:12:06,605
In my world, you're a skinny,
white insurance salesman.

154
00:12:08,847 --> 00:12:12,044
Oh. Hello boys,
I'm Stan's Aunt Flo.

155
00:12:12,167 --> 00:12:14,945
Whoa, what's wrong with your head?
Why are you shaking like that?

156
00:12:14,946 --> 00:12:16,846
Dude, that's not cool.
She's got Parkinson's Disease.

157
00:12:16,887 --> 00:12:21,597
Ah sweet. Hey guys check it out you
don't even have to put a quarter in her.

158
00:12:21,727 --> 00:12:23,718
- Cartman!
- Dude, this is hella-cool.

159
00:12:23,847 --> 00:12:27,965
- Aunt Flo, where did you get this goldfish?
- I got it from the pet store, Stanley.

160
00:12:28,087 --> 00:12:29,839
- Do you remember what pet store?
- Lets see.

161
00:12:29,967 --> 00:12:33,960
I believe it was called the "Indian Burial
Ground Pet Store" just outside of town.

162
00:12:34,087 --> 00:12:38,126
- Where? - I know I have the address
written down somewhere. Let me look.

163
00:12:38,247 --> 00:12:40,761
That's it dude. We gotta to take the
spooky fish back to that pet store.

164
00:12:40,887 --> 00:12:43,799
Who's "we"? Got a turd in your pocket.
I'm goin' home I'm hella-hungry.

165
00:12:43,927 --> 00:12:46,487
- JI'll help you Stan.
- Shut your goddamn mouth, fat ass.

166
00:12:46,607 --> 00:12:49,360
Dude, are you sure that fish is a murderer?
It seems like a normal fish to me.

167
00:12:49,487 --> 00:12:52,206
Just help me take it back c'mon.
Did you find the address Aunt Flo…

168
00:12:52,327 --> 00:12:55,285
- Aunt Flo!
- Stanley no! Not Aunt Flo!

169
00:12:55,407 --> 00:12:59,525
- It was the fish! - What a good
baby. What a good son I have.

170
00:13:00,687 --> 00:13:02,305
Now we'll never know
where that pet store is.

171
00:13:02,306 --> 00:13:04,306
There can't be that many pet
stores in South Park dude.

172
00:13:04,447 --> 00:13:07,475
Aunt Flo isn't from South Park. That pet store
could be anywhere between here and Denver.

173
00:13:07,476 --> 00:13:09,498
Well we better get working.
Cartman, you go home

174
00:13:09,498 --> 00:13:10,755
and call all the pet
stores in the phone book.

175
00:13:10,887 --> 00:13:13,242
- Can do.
- Screw you.

176
00:13:14,087 --> 00:13:16,078
It's all taken care of, Stanley.

177
00:13:17,607 --> 00:13:20,485
I've got such a good boy,
such a handsome boy.

178
00:13:20,607 --> 00:13:23,167
C'mon, we're running out of time.

179
00:13:23,287 --> 00:13:26,245
Say, why is the basement door locked?

180
00:13:26,447 --> 00:13:30,884
…crack corn and I don't care.
immy crack corn and I don't care.

181
00:13:31,007 --> 00:13:33,999
My mouse has gone away.

182
00:13:37,687 --> 00:13:40,565
Jimmy crack corn and I don't care…

183
00:13:41,487 --> 00:13:45,765
- I don't see any pet stores called Indian Burial
Ground. - Shut up, dude. I'm trying to watch TV.

184
00:13:45,887 --> 00:13:49,562
And now back to the Terrence
and Philip Halloween special.

185
00:13:52,727 --> 00:13:56,242
That fart was absolutely
ghoulish Terrence.

186
00:13:56,367 --> 00:13:59,279
- Ha ha. Man this is hella-funny.
- What's so funny about that?

187
00:13:59,407 --> 00:14:02,001
No Kitty that's my pot pie!

188
00:14:02,127 --> 00:14:06,678
- NO KITTY! THAT'S A BAD KITTY!
- Who's my kitty? Who's my mister kitty?

189
00:14:06,807 --> 00:14:11,198
My fluffy old pal. Yes, that's it,
that's my mister Kitty. Ya.

190
00:14:12,207 --> 00:14:14,596
DON'T PLAY WITH MY KITTY!

191
00:14:14,727 --> 00:14:16,206
You suck dude.

192
00:14:18,207 --> 00:14:21,995
Stanley, Kenny's mother is here. She's
wondering if you've seen Kenny.

193
00:14:22,127 --> 00:14:27,042
- You saw him didn't you? You
saw my boy. - Ya, my goldfish…

194
00:14:27,167 --> 00:14:31,319
Ya, Stan just got a new goldfish and he wanted
to show it to Kenny, but Kenny never came over.

195
00:14:31,447 --> 00:14:36,362
My Kenny used to laugh and play. He was
eight years old just like you my Kenny was.

196
00:14:36,487 --> 00:14:39,206
- I know. - You gotta tell me
what happened to him.

197
00:14:39,327 --> 00:14:43,115
- You have to know somthin'. - Mrs. McCormick,
I'm going to have to ask you to leave.

198
00:14:43,247 --> 00:14:46,717
- You've been drinking.
- That's right, I'm a little drunk.

199
00:14:46,847 --> 00:14:49,441
You'd be drunk too if you lost your boy.

200
00:14:49,567 --> 00:14:52,445
My Kenny used to sing and dance.

201
00:14:52,487 --> 00:14:54,921
- You guys I found the pet store.
- C'mon let's go.

202
00:14:55,047 --> 00:14:59,120
Mom, I know you think I did all this but I'm
gonna prove to you that it was this fucking fish.

203
00:14:59,247 --> 00:15:03,843
I believe you sweetheart. Run
from him boys. Run and don't stop.

204
00:15:07,607 --> 00:15:10,167
- Can I help you boys?
- I want to return a fish.

205
00:15:10,267 --> 00:15:13,443
- Dammit! - What? - That's
the ninth return I've had this week.

206
00:15:13,567 --> 00:15:16,445
What's wrong with it. Oh, let me guess,
it killed a bunch of people right?

207
00:15:16,567 --> 00:15:19,604
- Ya dude. - Dammit! Just
like all the other returns.

208
00:15:25,807 --> 00:15:28,480
Dude, why is your store called the
Indian Burial Ground Pet Store?

209
00:15:28,607 --> 00:15:31,519
Well, there was an Indian burial
ground here before I bought it

210
00:15:31,647 --> 00:15:34,241
So you just built your store on
top of Indian burial ground?

211
00:15:34,367 --> 00:15:37,404
Oh, hell no. First I
dug up all the bodies,

212
00:15:37,527 --> 00:15:40,485
pissed on 'em, and buried
them again upside down.

213
00:15:40,607 --> 00:15:42,723
- Why?
- Why?

214
00:15:42,847 --> 00:15:44,758
I don't know. I was drunk.

215
00:15:44,887 --> 00:15:48,277
We think that when you did that, you opened
up a door way to an evil parallel universe.

216
00:15:48,407 --> 00:15:51,479
- Well, that certainly would
explain a lot. - Like what?

217
00:15:51,607 --> 00:15:53,518
Well like this.

218
00:15:54,287 --> 00:15:56,562
I've been wondering what
the hell this was.

219
00:15:59,607 --> 00:16:02,201
Hello Mr. Marsh.
Top of the evening to you.

220
00:16:06,207 --> 00:16:08,243
OK. Boy then.

221
00:16:08,847 --> 00:16:10,439
- Sharon?
- Yes hon?

222
00:16:10,567 --> 00:16:13,718
There's a policeman being held
prisoner in our basement.

223
00:16:14,727 --> 00:16:19,642
Yes hon, I had to restrain him so he wouldn't find
the bodies in the backyard and take our baby away.

224
00:16:23,527 --> 00:16:26,963
Why'd you take his pants off?

225
00:16:28,847 --> 00:16:31,884
Sh-Sharon why'd you
take his pants off?

226
00:16:32,007 --> 00:16:35,363
- Oh Randy I just don't know
what to do any more. - What is it?

227
00:16:35,487 --> 00:16:40,641
I just… I can't believe Aunt Flo is gone,
that she won't be visiting me ever again.

228
00:16:41,407 --> 00:16:45,480
Oh, well don't think of it as an end,
think of it as a new beginning.

229
00:16:45,607 --> 00:16:48,917
Now could you fill me in on the dead bodies
and the captured policeman stuff real quick?

230
00:16:50,847 --> 00:16:54,157
Look pal, this is very simple.
All I want to do is return this fish.

231
00:16:54,287 --> 00:16:57,836
- I can't give you your money back. - I don't
care dude I just want the fish away from me.

232
00:16:57,967 --> 00:17:01,880
- No, I won't take it back. - Listen friend,
you just can't sell people pets like this.

233
00:17:02,007 --> 00:17:06,159
You have to have a sign that says: Warning!
These pets are from an evil parallel universe.

234
00:17:06,287 --> 00:17:09,404
Now it's not our fault you disrespected
the bodies of this land's native people,

235
00:17:09,527 --> 00:17:11,882
but, by golly, you're gonna
take this fish back.

236
00:17:12,007 --> 00:17:15,636
- Alright, you win.
- Wow. Thanks Evil Cartman.

237
00:17:15,767 --> 00:17:18,759
And sir, can I make a suggestion?
Move your store

238
00:17:18,887 --> 00:17:21,799
and let these great people of
the Wampanoa rest in peace.

239
00:17:21,927 --> 00:17:23,565
You kick ass Evil Cartman!

240
00:17:23,687 --> 00:17:26,501
And you know what I like best about you?
You don't say hella like our Cartman does.

241
00:17:26,502 --> 00:17:28,302
I swear, if he says that one
more time I'm gonna kill him.

242
00:17:28,487 --> 00:17:30,955
No Kyle, murder
is never an answer.

243
00:17:32,647 --> 00:17:34,524
What the?

244
00:17:34,647 --> 00:17:37,081
- Stan: He was here. Cartman
was just here. - Who are you?

245
00:17:37,207 --> 00:17:39,641
- We're looking for Cartman.
The trail ended here. - Where is he?

246
00:17:39,767 --> 00:17:42,679
- I don't know who you mean.
- Maybe this will jar your memory.

247
00:17:44,127 --> 00:17:46,960
No, stop you don't know what
you're doing. Those pets are evil.

248
00:17:50,407 --> 00:17:52,523
I'm sure glad that's over with.
Now I can sleep at night.

249
00:17:52,647 --> 00:17:55,659
Hey you guys we still have time to
enter the Pumpkin Carving Contest.

250
00:17:55,660 --> 00:17:56,760
Hey, ya. I almost forgot.

251
00:17:56,807 --> 00:17:59,765
C'mon. I bet that together, we
can make the best pumpkin ever.

252
00:17:59,887 --> 00:18:02,416
You know Evil Cartman, I like
you better than our Cartman.

253
00:18:02,417 --> 00:18:04,017
Ya, you're cool and
you don't say hella.

254
00:18:04,167 --> 00:18:08,285
Eh thank you guys. I certainly like you
more than in my evil parallel universe.

255
00:18:08,407 --> 00:18:10,716
They got me!

256
00:18:11,247 --> 00:18:13,886
- So when are we gonna buy a pumpkin
to carve? - Let's use Kenny's squash.

257
00:18:14,007 --> 00:18:16,594
Ya. You know, I never thought
it was such a bad little squash.

258
00:18:16,595 --> 00:18:19,195
It just needs some
tender, loving care.

259
00:18:23,327 --> 00:18:25,397
Ah man. This movie's hella-scary.

260
00:18:25,527 --> 00:18:29,000
- There you are Cartman.
- Nice costumes you guys.

261
00:18:29,001 --> 00:18:30,301
What'd do spend,
about a buck fifty on those?

262
00:18:30,367 --> 00:18:33,723
- We're here to take you back goody
two-shoes. - Oh. I got a better idea.

263
00:18:33,847 --> 00:18:36,680
Why don't you two go fuck yourselves?

264
00:18:36,807 --> 00:18:40,720
- Hey, what's wrong with you Cartman?
- What's wrong with me? Let's see, um...

265
00:18:40,847 --> 00:18:43,486
I hate you guys, you're hella-stupid…

266
00:18:43,607 --> 00:18:46,997
- C'mon Mister Wholesome, we're taking
you back to our universe. - Don't touch me!

267
00:18:47,127 --> 00:18:50,722
- What the hell's goin' on, Cartman never
hits us. - Alright just stand there Cartman.

268
00:18:50,847 --> 00:18:53,113
This gingerfication gun will send
you back to our universe.

269
00:18:53,114 --> 00:18:55,314
Oh wait, you guys are from
the evil parallel universe?

270
00:18:55,407 --> 00:18:57,523
- Yes. - Oh, well it's about
friggin time you showed up!

271
00:18:57,647 --> 00:19:00,639
You don't want me you want that
imposter. C'mon I'll show you.

272
00:19:03,047 --> 00:19:08,201
…and the winner is…squash-o-lantern
by Stan Marsh, Kyle Broslofski,

273
00:19:08,327 --> 00:19:11,478
and the Evil Eric Cartman
from a parallel universe.

274
00:19:11,607 --> 00:19:13,563
- We won, dude.
- Hooray!

275
00:19:13,687 --> 00:19:17,646
- You boys win the Halloween
chocolate ball. - Oh no.

276
00:19:17,767 --> 00:19:20,918
Stan and Kyle have come to take me back
to my world. I don't wanna go back.

277
00:19:21,047 --> 00:19:23,800
Don't worry Evil Cartman,
you're staying with us.

278
00:19:23,967 --> 00:19:26,640
Now zap his hella-ass back
to your… hella-universe.

279
00:19:26,767 --> 00:19:28,439
Stop saying hella, Cartman.

280
00:19:28,567 --> 00:19:30,637
- Thought you could get away
from us, huh Cartman. - Please.

281
00:19:30,767 --> 00:19:32,678
- Leave him alone butt hole!
- Shut your trap kid!

282
00:19:32,807 --> 00:19:35,299
Why don't you guys take our Cartman
back? He's more like you anyways.

283
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:36,800
Hey! You back
stabbing sell-out.

284
00:19:36,807 --> 00:19:40,117
It's time Cartman.
Prepare for Gingerfication.

285
00:19:40,247 --> 00:19:43,125
Well, goodbye you
guys. It's been fun.

286
00:19:51,327 --> 00:19:54,603
- Oh, what now?
- It's the evil pets!

287
00:19:56,527 --> 00:20:00,839
- The Gingerfication gun.
- Get to the stage.

288
00:20:04,207 --> 00:20:07,756
Oh dear. It really was Stan's
fish that killed all those people.

289
00:20:08,887 --> 00:20:11,560
- Give me that gun kid.
- Up yours evil twin.

290
00:20:16,567 --> 00:20:19,718
Alright now you just got to send this bozo
through and the whole mess will be over with.

291
00:20:19,847 --> 00:20:22,566
- Sorry Cartman. We like Evil
Cartman better. See ya. -What?

292
00:20:22,687 --> 00:20:26,839
We can't deal with you saying hella anymore
Cartman. You're going to the other universe.

293
00:20:33,927 --> 00:20:36,566
- Which one is the good Cartman?
- I am.

294
00:20:36,687 --> 00:20:39,599
Stop wasting time Cartman. We got to
send one of you back to the universe.

295
00:20:39,727 --> 00:20:42,082
Ya. Now, which one of you is
the Cartman we can't stand?

296
00:20:42,207 --> 00:20:43,845
He is.

297
00:20:44,887 --> 00:20:47,879
- Time is running out you'll have
to destroy us both. - What!?

298
00:20:48,007 --> 00:20:52,319
It's the only way you can be sure. We
have to both go for the good of the world.

299
00:20:53,607 --> 00:20:56,963
Noooo! Screw you guys.

300
00:20:57,087 --> 00:21:00,238
- How did you guys know? - Our Cartman
would never say anything like that.

301
00:21:00,367 --> 00:21:05,236
- You guys are hella-stupid. I knew
you would fall for that. - Oh no, dude.

302
00:21:05,367 --> 00:21:07,756
- You tricked us Cartman.
- That's right I did.

303
00:21:07,887 --> 00:21:12,597
You guys are hella-stupid, you guys are
hella-lame, you guys are hella-dumb,

304
00:21:12,727 --> 00:21:14,957
- Hella hella hella.
- Dammit!

305
00:21:15,087 --> 00:21:17,376
I'm sorry my wife held
you captive Officer.

306
00:21:17,377 --> 00:21:20,477
She's been upset over Aunt
Flo isn't gonna visit anymore.

307
00:21:20,527 --> 00:21:25,362
Oh I understand. I remember when my
wife stopped getting her monthly visitor.

308
00:21:25,487 --> 00:21:30,959
- Well, do you want your pants back?
- No. Just leave me with my dignity.

309
00:21:31,087 --> 00:21:34,284
Ok people, move along,
nothing to see here.
