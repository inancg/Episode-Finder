1
00:00:38,247 --> 00:00:40,140
Settle down children.

2
00:00:40,141 --> 00:00:44,141
I have some difficult news which
is going to make you all very sad.

3
00:00:44,287 --> 00:00:47,400
The school board is considering
firing me as your teacher.

4
00:00:48,327 --> 00:00:52,764
There is a possibility I might be let go
and never allowed to teach you again.

5
00:00:52,887 --> 00:00:55,082
- Yes Stanley?
- That's ok with us.

6
00:00:55,207 --> 00:00:57,926
- That's fine. - No, it isn't
it makes you very sad!

7
00:00:58,047 --> 00:01:00,281
Now apparently the
school board thinks that I

8
00:01:00,282 --> 00:01:01,482
don't teach you anything
about current events.

9
00:01:01,487 --> 00:01:05,275
So tomorrow they're gonna have you
do presentations for the whole board.

10
00:01:06,527 --> 00:01:08,460
"Current events in South Park".

11
00:01:08,461 --> 00:01:11,461
ow I want you all to read a news
paper or better yet watch television

12
00:01:11,887 --> 00:01:14,924
and come up with something current
in South Park to do a report on.

13
00:01:16,287 --> 00:01:20,075
Now this will be a group project so I'm
gonna place you all into groups of five.

14
00:01:20,207 --> 00:01:23,882
Wendy, Bebe, Clyde, Pip, and
Token, you'll be group one.

15
00:01:24,007 --> 00:01:28,478
And group two will be Stan,
Kyle, Eric, Kenny, and…

16
00:01:29,287 --> 00:01:31,437
and Tweek.

17
00:01:31,567 --> 00:01:34,400
- Oh not Tweek. - We don't
wanna be in a group with Tweek.

18
00:01:34,527 --> 00:01:37,837
There's nothing wrong with Tweek. I
bet he'll do a great job in your group.

19
00:01:37,967 --> 00:01:40,554
I can't stand that kind of
pressure! No sweet Jesus please!

20
00:01:40,555 --> 00:01:42,355
Dude, we can't
work with this kid.

21
00:01:42,487 --> 00:01:44,642
That's what Chet Everet
thought when the new female

22
00:01:44,643 --> 00:01:46,643
intern joined the
cast of Medical Center.

23
00:01:46,727 --> 00:01:49,223
He thought who is this woman
with her gozungas and high heels?

24
00:01:49,224 --> 00:01:50,224
What does she
know about medicine?

25
00:01:50,225 --> 00:01:52,648
Well that intern saved
Chet Everet's brother

26
00:01:52,649 --> 00:01:55,549
with a kidney
transplant so you see?

27
00:01:55,607 --> 00:01:57,484
- No. - Well let
me put another way.

28
00:01:57,607 --> 00:02:01,122
You have to give your reports to
the town committee tomorrow!

29
00:02:01,247 --> 00:02:03,752
And if it doesn't kick ass
and you make me look bad,

30
00:02:03,753 --> 00:02:05,853
Mr. Hat is gonna
smack you bitches up!

31
00:02:13,767 --> 00:02:16,406
- Hello there customer.
- Hello, how are you today?

32
00:02:16,527 --> 00:02:19,485
Great. What can I get for you?
Large coffee, small coffee?

33
00:02:19,607 --> 00:02:21,618
I'm actually interested
in something else.

34
00:02:21,619 --> 00:02:24,019
I'm John Poston from the
Harbuck's Coffee Corporation.

35
00:02:24,047 --> 00:02:26,402
Oh, you're that corporate
guy who keeps calling.

36
00:02:26,527 --> 00:02:29,961
That's right. How come
you don't call me back?

37
00:02:29,962 --> 00:02:32,662
All we wanna do is buy
out your coffee shop here.

38
00:02:32,767 --> 00:02:35,034
Oh forget it. My-my
store is not for sale.

39
00:02:35,035 --> 00:02:39,035
My company's prepared to
make you a very generous offer.

40
00:02:40,447 --> 00:02:42,782
This is a
Crampsonite brief case.

41
00:02:42,783 --> 00:02:45,583
All leathered, has four compartments,
and a key with lock. Interested?

42
00:02:45,687 --> 00:02:48,445
I don't think so. My coffee
shop is worth a lot to me.

43
00:02:48,446 --> 00:02:50,546
Alright how about five
hundred thousand dollars?

44
00:02:50,647 --> 00:02:52,239
The answer is still no Mr. Poston.

45
00:02:52,367 --> 00:02:55,302
You see when my father opened
this store thirty years ago,

46
00:02:55,303 --> 00:02:58,303
he cared about only one thing
making a great cup of coffee.

47
00:02:58,407 --> 00:03:02,155
Sure we may take a little longer to brew
a cup, we may not call it fancy names.

48
00:03:02,156 --> 00:03:04,056
I just guess we
care a little more.

49
00:03:04,127 --> 00:03:06,193
And that's why Tweek
coffee is still home

50
00:03:06,194 --> 00:03:07,794
brewed with the finest
beans we can muster.

51
00:03:07,847 --> 00:03:12,523
Yes Tweek coffee is a simpler
coffee for a simpler America.

52
00:03:12,647 --> 00:03:15,356
Well that's to bad.
We're just gonna have

53
00:03:15,357 --> 00:03:17,657
to open our Harbucks
right next door to you.

54
00:03:17,727 --> 00:03:19,408
But that could put
me out of business.

55
00:03:19,409 --> 00:03:23,409
This is a capitalist country
pal. Get used to it.

56
00:03:24,007 --> 00:03:26,965
- Hello Mr. Tweek.
- Hi Officer Barbrady.

57
00:03:27,087 --> 00:03:30,238
- Who was that? - Oh just some
dong. What can I get for you?

58
00:03:30,367 --> 00:03:31,858
The usual.

59
00:03:33,567 --> 00:03:36,457
- Thanks see you tomorrow.
- Bye-bye.

60
00:03:40,047 --> 00:03:43,278
Ok we have to do this
stupid report on so...

61
00:03:47,167 --> 00:03:50,318
So lets figure out
what to do it about.

62
00:03:52,087 --> 00:03:55,318
How about we do it on that Raymond guy
on TV, you know everybody loves Raymond.

63
00:03:55,447 --> 00:03:57,429
No Cartman, we can't
do it on Raymond again.

64
00:03:57,430 --> 00:03:59,930
It has to be on a current event in South
Park. Tweek do you have any ideas?

65
00:04:00,127 --> 00:04:02,846
- This is to much pressure.
- Great. Lot of help you are kid.

66
00:04:02,967 --> 00:04:04,396
- The Gnomes.
- What?

67
00:04:04,397 --> 00:04:06,597
- We can do a report on the
gnomes. - What gnomes?

68
00:04:06,727 --> 00:04:09,406
The Underpants Gnomes. The
little guys that come in your room

69
00:04:09,407 --> 00:04:10,907
real late-late at night
and steal your underpants.

70
00:04:13,287 --> 00:04:16,916
So that's where all my underpants go. - Dude
that's the dumbest thing I've ever heard.

71
00:04:17,047 --> 00:04:19,925
I've never seen any underpants gnomes.
- They come out at 3:30 in the morning.

72
00:04:20,047 --> 00:04:23,278
Most people aren't up then,
but I am. I can't sleep ever.

73
00:04:23,407 --> 00:04:25,547
Dude we can't do a presentation
on underpants gnomes.

74
00:04:25,548 --> 00:04:27,248
Mr. Garrison will fail
because you're making it up.

75
00:04:27,327 --> 00:04:30,302
Sleep at my house tonight.
I'll prove it to you.

76
00:04:31,127 --> 00:04:33,773
They want me to sell the
store. It's so much money.

77
00:04:33,774 --> 00:04:35,574
Some things are more
important than money.

78
00:04:35,607 --> 00:04:40,044
The people of South Park count on you to
give them that first cup of coffee everyday.

79
00:04:40,167 --> 00:04:43,936
I know, but if they open a Harbucks right
next door we might go out of business.

80
00:04:43,937 --> 00:04:45,937
They really have my
balls in a vice-grip.

81
00:04:46,887 --> 00:04:49,765
Oh hello son.
How was your day?

82
00:04:49,887 --> 00:04:52,401
- That's good. Who are your little
friends? - What do you mean!

83
00:04:52,527 --> 00:04:55,405
- We're his oral report. - Ya. We
have to stay up all night to write it.

84
00:04:55,527 --> 00:04:58,378
Well have some coffee boys.
I'll brew up another pot for later.

85
00:04:58,379 --> 00:05:00,179
Coffee? I don't
think I like coffee.

86
00:05:00,247 --> 00:05:02,643
Oh you'll like this
coffee, it's fresh.

87
00:05:02,644 --> 00:05:05,544
Country fresh, like the
morning after a rain storm.

88
00:05:05,607 --> 00:05:08,532
Kay. Maybe it'll help us figure out
what to do our report on. We have to

89
00:05:08,533 --> 00:05:10,633
present it to the entire South
Park town committee tomorrow.

90
00:05:10,727 --> 00:05:14,405
Oh. I've got one for you. How
about doing a report on how large

91
00:05:14,406 --> 00:05:17,006
corporations take over little
family owned businesses.

92
00:05:17,087 --> 00:05:19,317
- Richard!
- No I'm serious hon.

93
00:05:19,447 --> 00:05:22,120
These boys should learn how the
corporate machine is ruining America.

94
00:05:22,247 --> 00:05:25,810
You see, I own a coffee shop and
now some great, big multimillion-dollar

95
00:05:25,811 --> 00:05:28,111
company is going to move in
and try to take all my business,

96
00:05:28,127 --> 00:05:31,642
which means I may have to shut down
and sell my son Tweek into slavery.

97
00:05:31,767 --> 00:05:34,156
- Slavery?!
- Yes slavery.

98
00:05:34,287 --> 00:05:37,563
- Wow that sucks dude. - They really
have my balls in a salad shooter.

99
00:05:37,687 --> 00:05:40,406
We're already doing a paper on
Tweek's underpants gnomes.

100
00:05:40,527 --> 00:05:44,725
Now Tweek, how many times do we have
to tell you, your underpants are missing

101
00:05:44,847 --> 00:05:47,361
because you lose them not
because of underpants gnomes.

102
00:05:47,487 --> 00:05:49,010
C'mon you guys.
We better get to work.

103
00:05:49,011 --> 00:05:52,711
Ok, but corporate takeovers
is a much more fertile subject.

104
00:05:52,887 --> 00:05:56,163
Honestly Richard, I don't see why you
have to preach to some eight-year-olds.

105
00:05:56,287 --> 00:06:00,075
Actually honey, I think those little tikes
are just what we need. I've got an idea.

106
00:06:03,167 --> 00:06:05,635
- Man, this stuff is strong.
- Kinda bitter.

107
00:06:05,767 --> 00:06:08,884
- What if my parents go out of business?
What'll I do? - Don't worry about it.

108
00:06:09,007 --> 00:06:12,556
But we'll starve and die like dogs. - Tweek,
Tweek, you can always go on welfare.

109
00:06:12,687 --> 00:06:13,889
Look at Kenny's family.

110
00:06:13,890 --> 00:06:16,890
They're perfectly happy being poor
and on welfare, right Kenny? - Fuck you.

111
00:06:16,927 --> 00:06:20,715
You suck Kenny. - Well let's just try and
finish all this coffee so we can stay up.

112
00:06:24,447 --> 00:06:26,642
This stuff rocks.

113
00:06:26,767 --> 00:06:28,485
Totally dude. I feel awesome!

114
00:06:31,287 --> 00:06:34,757
You guys! You guys!
Seriously! I feel great!

115
00:06:36,447 --> 00:06:39,166
- Hey Tweek, do have anymore of
this stuff? - Just some grounds.

116
00:06:39,287 --> 00:06:40,925
KILLER!

117
00:06:42,207 --> 00:06:44,641
Hey let me have some grounds!

118
00:06:45,607 --> 00:06:48,041
Whoa Cartman. Whoopee!

119
00:06:50,727 --> 00:06:54,356
- Oh, my stomach hurts.
- Ya mine too. I wonder why?

120
00:06:54,487 --> 00:06:57,604
Well it's three thirty and I don't any
goddamn underpants gnomes, Tweek.

121
00:06:57,727 --> 00:07:01,925
M-maybe it's all in my head. Maybe I'm
going insane. Oh no I'm going insane!

122
00:07:02,087 --> 00:07:05,045
Well this is just great. We haven't gotten
anything done and we're totally screwed.

123
00:07:05,167 --> 00:07:07,237
- How's the report
going boys? - Bad.

124
00:07:07,367 --> 00:07:09,358
Oh, do you need
some more coffee?

125
00:07:09,487 --> 00:07:11,717
No… more… coffee.

126
00:07:11,847 --> 00:07:17,001
Well boys, I don't mean to pry, but if
you want it, I wrote your report for you.

127
00:07:17,127 --> 00:07:20,039
- You did!? - Yes, It's all
about corporate takeovers.

128
00:07:20,167 --> 00:07:23,239
- Of course, you don't have
to use it. - No, we'll use it.

129
00:07:23,367 --> 00:07:27,280
Alright, and it can be our little secret
about who wrote it, right? - Sure!

130
00:07:27,487 --> 00:07:31,400
When you kids do the report make
sure you read this part first alright?

131
00:07:32,687 --> 00:07:35,406
- There they are! - Time
to go to work, work all night.

132
00:07:35,527 --> 00:07:41,318
Gotta get underpants we. We won't stop until
we have underpants. Lots of yummy pants we.

133
00:07:42,727 --> 00:07:44,763
You guys look!
Look you're missing it!

134
00:07:48,247 --> 00:07:49,441
They took 'em again!

135
00:07:49,567 --> 00:07:51,922
- Thanks dude.
- My pleasure. Good night boys.

136
00:07:52,047 --> 00:07:53,527
Wow Tweek, your dad rocks.

137
00:07:53,528 --> 00:07:56,128
Why do they torture me like this?!
Why can't they leave me alone?!

138
00:07:56,207 --> 00:07:59,279
- Dammit, what the hell is wrong with you
Tweek? - They took my underpants again.

139
00:07:59,407 --> 00:08:02,604
Soon they'll want
my blood. Blood!

140
00:08:08,207 --> 00:08:13,122
And as the voluminous corporate automaton
bulldozes it's way through bantam America,

141
00:08:13,247 --> 00:08:18,037
What will become of the
endeavoring American family?

142
00:08:18,167 --> 00:08:20,096
I don't think they
wrote this, Mr. Hat.

143
00:08:20,097 --> 00:08:23,597
Perhaps there is no stopping
the corporate machine.

144
00:08:23,847 --> 00:08:28,125
- And that's our report. I guess. - Well
boys it's obvious that you didn't even...

145
00:08:28,247 --> 00:08:30,477
- Great job.
- Yes, great job.

146
00:08:30,607 --> 00:08:34,520
Boys you have really opened our eyes.
We didn't even know this was happening.

147
00:08:34,647 --> 00:08:37,639
- Neither did we. - Well Mr. Garrison it
looks like we were wrong about you.

148
00:08:37,767 --> 00:08:40,042
You really are teaching
these kids something.

149
00:08:40,167 --> 00:08:43,398
Ya well I don't wanna sound like
a dick hole, but I told you so.

150
00:08:43,527 --> 00:08:47,360
I am really moved. I say
we follow these boys' cause.

151
00:08:47,361 --> 00:08:50,061
Let's join them in the fight
against corporate takeovers.

152
00:08:50,167 --> 00:08:53,603
- Lead the way boys.
- It's to much pressure!

153
00:08:55,767 --> 00:09:01,000
Good, good. Now make sure that
sign is really bright and flashy now.

154
00:09:01,127 --> 00:09:04,250
My goodness, that's going to be
a really big coffee house, honey.

155
00:09:04,251 --> 00:09:06,851
Yes it is. They really have
my balls in a juice maker.

156
00:09:06,927 --> 00:09:10,237
Oh hello son,
how did your report go?

157
00:09:10,367 --> 00:09:12,642
I think it went really good.
Those people really go into it.

158
00:09:12,767 --> 00:09:16,142
Really? Well son you might have
just saved the family business,

159
00:09:16,143 --> 00:09:17,343
what do you have
to say about that?

160
00:09:17,407 --> 00:09:19,716
- I need coffee.
- I know how you boys feel.

161
00:09:19,847 --> 00:09:22,244
Sometimes a hot cup of
French Roast Almerato

162
00:09:22,245 --> 00:09:24,245
is just what a man needs
to get him through the day.

163
00:09:24,367 --> 00:09:28,804
That smooth aroma and mild taste is
what makes Tweek Coffee so very special.

164
00:09:28,927 --> 00:09:32,442
Special, like an Arizona sunrise
or a Juniper wet with dew.

165
00:09:32,567 --> 00:09:35,400
A lite rain in the middle of a dusty afternoon
or a hug from your dear old aunt...

166
00:09:35,527 --> 00:09:37,677
- Dad! - What?
- The metaphors, man.

167
00:09:37,807 --> 00:09:39,559
Oh sorry. Here you go.

168
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:41,760
Hey, do you ever think that maybe
you shouldn't give your son coffee?

169
00:09:41,807 --> 00:09:45,766
- Like how do you mean? - Like look at
him. He's always shaking and nervous.

170
00:09:45,887 --> 00:09:49,276
Oh that. He has ADD,
Attention Deficit Disorder.

171
00:09:49,277 --> 00:09:51,777
That's why he's so
jittery all the time.

172
00:09:51,887 --> 00:09:57,245
Mr. Tweek, we only just heard. - Oh, hello
committee members. What a surprise.

173
00:09:57,367 --> 00:10:00,757
So this is the corporate bulldozer
trying to push you off the map?

174
00:10:00,887 --> 00:10:04,641
Yes, how did you hear? - These boys did
an excellent report for us this morning.

175
00:10:04,767 --> 00:10:07,600
- They're so upset by this
whole thing. - My butt hurts.

176
00:10:07,727 --> 00:10:09,222
Don't worry Mr. Tweek,

177
00:10:09,223 --> 00:10:13,023
this committee is not going to let you
run out of business by these bastards.

178
00:10:13,127 --> 00:10:16,278
You hear that you're not gonna
get away with this you whore!

179
00:10:16,407 --> 00:10:17,920
Excuse me!

180
00:10:18,047 --> 00:10:21,756
Boys, we've talked it over and we want
you to take your case to the mayor.

181
00:10:21,887 --> 00:10:24,845
- Our case? - No man!
That is way to much pressure.

182
00:10:24,967 --> 00:10:28,004
- Oh you'll do fine son.
- C'mon boys, let's go!

183
00:10:28,127 --> 00:10:30,102
Aw man, this sucks.

184
00:10:32,247 --> 00:10:35,017
And we would have never even
known this was happening

185
00:10:35,018 --> 00:10:37,218
if it wasn't for these
boys' excellent report.

186
00:10:37,327 --> 00:10:40,880
You're telling me that students
from Mr. Garrison's class actually did

187
00:10:40,881 --> 00:10:42,881
something that had some kind
of relevance to the world?

188
00:10:42,927 --> 00:10:44,838
That's right.

189
00:10:44,967 --> 00:10:47,242
- Mr. Garrison? The guy
with the puppet? - Yes.

190
00:10:47,367 --> 00:10:50,072
Well, I must say Garrison, perhaps
you aren't as stupid and crazy

191
00:10:50,073 --> 00:10:51,433
as I always tell people you are.

192
00:10:51,447 --> 00:10:54,325
Thank you mayor. I don't want
to sound like a dick hole but I...

193
00:10:54,447 --> 00:10:57,757
Mayor, these boys want that
Harbucks Coffee shut down right now.

194
00:10:58,927 --> 00:11:01,236
Well I can't just shut them down.
This is a free country.

195
00:11:01,367 --> 00:11:05,042
- But they're ruining our city. - The
best I can do is create a proposition.

196
00:11:05,167 --> 00:11:06,749
We'll call it Prop Ten.

197
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:09,650
The town can vote on it, and if it
passes we'll see what we can do.

198
00:11:09,767 --> 00:11:13,521
- Hurray! - What do you say
boys? We're gonna pass a law.

199
00:11:14,167 --> 00:11:16,727
- Uh, hurray. - So I guess you
wanna do some campaigning.

200
00:11:16,847 --> 00:11:21,125
You can do commercials and thing like that.
We can have a vote in the middle of town,

201
00:11:21,247 --> 00:11:24,796
and obviously if more than fifty
percent of the people show up

202
00:11:24,927 --> 00:11:29,876
and care enough to want Harbucks out,
then they're out. So good luck to you.

203
00:11:30,607 --> 00:11:32,916
- Didn't you see them?!
- Alright what's next?

204
00:11:33,047 --> 00:11:37,518
- Next is issue thirty-seven-D,
missing underpants. - Is it cold in here?

205
00:11:37,647 --> 00:11:39,956
Boys could I have a quick
this and that with you?

206
00:11:40,087 --> 00:11:42,263
Boys I don't know
who wrote that report,

207
00:11:42,264 --> 00:11:44,664
but now that you've convinced
everybody, you better stick with it.

208
00:11:44,727 --> 00:11:47,203
Because if these people find out that
you didn't really write that paper

209
00:11:47,204 --> 00:11:51,884
and I actually do get fired, then Mr. Hat
is gonna do horrible things to you.

210
00:11:52,807 --> 00:11:56,402
Oh not that Mr. Hat,
that's real horrible.

211
00:11:56,527 --> 00:11:59,439
Anyway, good luck passing
your new law boys.

212
00:11:59,567 --> 00:12:01,444
Jesus man, Jesus!
What are we gonna do huh?!

213
00:12:01,567 --> 00:12:07,403
Live! It's the South Park Town Hall meeting
on Public Access. Tonight's topic, Prop Ten!

214
00:12:08,927 --> 00:12:13,159
Should Harbucks be able to open a store
in South Park? That's tonight's topic.

215
00:12:13,287 --> 00:12:17,121
On my left, five innocent,
starry-eyed boys from middle America.

216
00:12:17,247 --> 00:12:21,525
On my right a big fat, smelly
corporate guy from New York.

217
00:12:21,647 --> 00:12:25,117
- Hey, I'm not fat or smelly.
- Alright Mr. Deuschbag.

218
00:12:25,247 --> 00:12:29,160
Poston. - Pardon me Mr. Ass Face. Anyway
let's hear your side of the argument.

219
00:12:30,047 --> 00:12:34,484
My argument is simple, this country
is founded on free enterprise.

220
00:12:34,607 --> 00:12:37,758
Harbucks is an organization that...

221
00:12:37,887 --> 00:12:41,277
An organization that
prides itself on great coffee!

222
00:12:41,407 --> 00:12:44,319
We simply want to...
Aw to hell with you!

223
00:12:44,447 --> 00:12:49,965
Ok, Arcafé. Now for the other side of the
argument we turn to our young, handsome lads.

224
00:12:51,087 --> 00:12:53,181
Boys your thoughts.

225
00:12:53,807 --> 00:12:57,356
C'mon boys, don't be shy.
What's your principle argument?

226
00:13:02,327 --> 00:13:04,522
This guy sucks ass!

227
00:13:06,127 --> 00:13:08,436
- Great argument.
You win boys. - What?!

228
00:13:08,567 --> 00:13:10,159
That was close Mr. Hat.

229
00:13:11,847 --> 00:13:16,637
What is the future of America? Is it the
money we make? The quests we conquer?

230
00:13:16,767 --> 00:13:22,683
No. It's the children. So what do the
children have to say about Prop Ten?

231
00:13:22,807 --> 00:13:26,436
- I don't like big corporations.
- I like small businesses.

232
00:13:26,567 --> 00:13:30,446
I believe in the family
owned enterprise.

233
00:13:31,047 --> 00:13:33,447
To get back to the
home owned enterprise.

234
00:13:34,327 --> 00:13:39,447
It's time to stop large corporations.
Prop Ten is about children.

235
00:13:39,567 --> 00:13:43,446
Vote yes on Prop Ten
or else you hate children.

236
00:13:43,567 --> 00:13:47,924
You don't hate children, do you?

237
00:13:48,047 --> 00:13:51,960
Remember, keep American
business small or else...

238
00:13:52,487 --> 00:13:56,654
Paid for by citizens for a
fair and equal way to get

239
00:13:56,655 --> 00:13:59,655
Harbucks Coffee kicked
out of town forever.

240
00:14:00,087 --> 00:14:03,079
- Well, what do you think?
- Oh, i-it's great.

241
00:14:03,207 --> 00:14:07,519
- Yes it is. We'll put it on the air
immediately. - What do you think hon?

242
00:14:07,647 --> 00:14:09,444
Hon, what's the matter?

243
00:14:09,567 --> 00:14:12,240
- I have a big problem with this.
- What do you mean?

244
00:14:12,367 --> 00:14:16,838
We're just using those boys for our benefit.
They have no idea what they're saying.

245
00:14:16,967 --> 00:14:19,276
But kids are great to
get people on our side.

246
00:14:19,407 --> 00:14:23,605
You don't just throw a child in a
political commercial to sell your beliefs.

247
00:14:23,727 --> 00:14:26,082
I won't be a part
of this anymore.

248
00:14:26,207 --> 00:14:29,643
Honey, all's fair in love
and war… and coffee.

249
00:14:29,767 --> 00:14:32,201
Hon?

250
00:14:35,647 --> 00:14:40,198
Take your corporate coffee
and go back to New York City!

251
00:14:40,327 --> 00:14:45,242
It's people like you who
are ruining Main Street, USA!

252
00:14:45,367 --> 00:14:49,679
How many Native Americans did you
slaughter to make that coffee, huh?!

253
00:14:52,087 --> 00:14:57,207
Damn, these people aren't buying any coffee.
I'll have to try and apeal to the younger crowd.

254
00:14:58,847 --> 00:15:02,886
Hey kid, I'm Camel Joe and
I love a fresh cup of coffee.

255
00:15:03,007 --> 00:15:07,159
It's yum diddly-icous.
It makes you feel super.

256
00:15:08,287 --> 00:15:12,565
I have a surprise for you. The
new kiddycinno from Harbucks.

257
00:15:12,687 --> 00:15:15,274
More sugar than all
the other goodies

258
00:15:15,275 --> 00:15:17,975
kids like with all the caffeine
of a normal Double Latte.

259
00:15:18,047 --> 00:15:20,117
No Billy. No coffee for you.

260
00:15:20,247 --> 00:15:25,480
You should be ashamed of yourself. Using
cartoons to push caffeine on children.

261
00:15:25,607 --> 00:15:28,519
Why don't you go back to the
hole you crawled out from lady?

262
00:15:28,647 --> 00:15:32,959
Uh, Mr. Poston I think you've got
a lot to learn about making coffee.

263
00:15:33,087 --> 00:15:36,875
Oh, you don't? Your coffee tastes
like three-day-old- moldy diarrhea.

264
00:15:37,007 --> 00:15:39,831
I'm sorry to inform you that this
town is having a vote tomorrow,

265
00:15:39,832 --> 00:15:42,332
and if the law passes you'll
be thrown out of town.

266
00:15:42,407 --> 00:15:44,523
- What?! - At five
o'clock the best coffee wins.

267
00:15:44,647 --> 00:15:48,560
Either your coffee or a fresh
warm cup of Tweek's coffee.

268
00:15:48,687 --> 00:15:51,021
Like an old sweater that keeps
getting warmer with age,

269
00:15:51,022 --> 00:15:54,322
you can count on Tweek's
coffee to start your day.

270
00:15:54,407 --> 00:15:58,116
Tomorrow for the Prop Ten vote
we'll set up ballot booths… here.

271
00:15:58,247 --> 00:16:00,284
Alright and then we'll
put up the stage here.

272
00:16:00,285 --> 00:16:02,585
Before the vote we'll get a band
that everyone likes, like, uh, like...

273
00:16:02,647 --> 00:16:04,365
- like...
- Toto.

274
00:16:04,487 --> 00:16:07,466
Like Toto. And then the Harbucks guy
will have five minutes to speak and

275
00:16:07,467 --> 00:16:09,767
then those boys will have five minutes
to speak and then the town votes.

276
00:16:09,847 --> 00:16:12,839
- Uh boys, you better get your
asses to work. - What now?

277
00:16:12,967 --> 00:16:15,817
They're expecting you to give a
big speech on corporate takeovers

278
00:16:15,818 --> 00:16:17,318
and this time it has
to last five minutes.

279
00:16:17,447 --> 00:16:20,757
- Oh god, when is this gonna end?
- Your dad really screwed us Tweek.

280
00:16:20,887 --> 00:16:24,323
Jesus dude. I'm to blame for all
this. I'm to blame for everything!

281
00:16:28,087 --> 00:16:31,238
- So what are we gonna say? - Why don't
we just read the paper we wrote last time?

282
00:16:31,367 --> 00:16:33,642
Because then they'll we didn't
write it dummy. We have to be original.

283
00:16:33,767 --> 00:16:36,359
Does anybody know
anything about corporations?

284
00:16:39,327 --> 00:16:41,841
- I think my mom is a corporation.
- Ya that makes sense.

285
00:16:41,967 --> 00:16:45,004
- You guys! - How about we say
corporates should be stopped.

286
00:16:45,127 --> 00:16:48,483
- How do we stretch that into five
minutes? - They're taking my underpants!

287
00:16:48,607 --> 00:16:51,326
Will you stop with the underpants
gnome, Tweek? We have to work here.

288
00:16:54,287 --> 00:16:56,960
- What the hell?
- Well I'll be damned.

289
00:16:57,087 --> 00:17:00,238
That's my last pair
of underpants!

290
00:17:03,807 --> 00:17:06,605
- Don't scare him.
- Hey there little guy.

291
00:17:06,727 --> 00:17:08,819
- Bad!
- Cartman! - What?

292
00:17:08,847 --> 00:17:10,893
Why do you always have
to hit stuff with a stick?

293
00:17:10,894 --> 00:17:13,394
Well look at him. He's all…
you know… look at him.

294
00:17:13,407 --> 00:17:15,875
- Is that all you got pussy?
- What?! - Hey he talked.

295
00:17:16,007 --> 00:17:19,602
- Ya he called me a pussy. I'm not a pussy
you're a pussy! - You're a pussy, pussy.

296
00:17:19,847 --> 00:17:23,726
Dude, why are you taking Tweek's underpants?
- Ya, look what you're doing to this poor kid.

297
00:17:23,847 --> 00:17:27,476
Stealing underpants, big business. - Business?
Wait, do you know anything about business?

298
00:17:27,607 --> 00:17:29,757
- Sure that's what gnomes do.
- Show us.

299
00:17:29,887 --> 00:17:31,837
Ok. Follow me.

300
00:17:32,967 --> 00:17:35,720
Little pussy gnome.
Don't call me a pussy.

301
00:17:38,047 --> 00:17:41,039
- Not much longer now. - Oh are you
taking us to your little pussy house?

302
00:17:41,167 --> 00:17:43,761
- No Pussy, I'm taking you to my
village. - Oh, your pussy village?

303
00:17:43,887 --> 00:17:45,525
Cartman will you just shut
up and let him show us?

304
00:17:46,647 --> 00:17:50,481
Follow me. - I hope we're not wasting
our time with this little pecker.

305
00:17:54,687 --> 00:17:58,043
Well, it looks like Harbucks will
never make it in this town.

306
00:17:58,167 --> 00:18:01,842
Alright boys. That's it. Pack it
up, we're moving out of town.

307
00:18:01,967 --> 00:18:06,119
But we just finished. - I know. But these
folks obviously don't want us here.

308
00:18:06,247 --> 00:18:08,522
But what will become of us?

309
00:18:08,647 --> 00:18:11,719
Oh quit being so melodramatic,
Sanchez. Jesus Christ.

310
00:18:13,367 --> 00:18:17,679
Damn, dude. This place is huge. - Ya,
It's almost as big as Cartman's ass.

311
00:18:17,807 --> 00:18:21,800
- No it isn't you guys.
- This is where all our work is done.

312
00:18:21,927 --> 00:18:24,315
So what are you gonna do with
all these underpants you steal?

313
00:18:24,316 --> 00:18:28,316
Collecting underpants is just phase
one. Phase one collect underpants.

314
00:18:28,407 --> 00:18:31,365
So what's phase two?

315
00:18:33,607 --> 00:18:37,486
- Hey, what's phase two?!
- Phase one we collect underpants.

316
00:18:37,607 --> 00:18:39,916
Ya, ya, ya.
But what about phase two?

317
00:18:42,327 --> 00:18:45,637
- Well phase three is profit.
Get it? - I don't get it.

318
00:18:45,767 --> 00:18:49,442
You see, Phase one collect
underpants, phase two...

319
00:18:50,287 --> 00:18:52,847
- Phase three profit.
- Oh I get it.

320
00:18:52,967 --> 00:18:56,243
- No you don't fat ass. - Do you guys
know anything about corporations?

321
00:18:56,367 --> 00:18:59,643
- You bet we do. - Us gnomes
are geniuses at corporations.

322
00:19:02,007 --> 00:19:03,998
Jesus, look out!

323
00:19:06,047 --> 00:19:07,958
- Oh my god they killed Kenny.
- You bastards.

324
00:19:08,087 --> 00:19:11,009
Listen we have to give a huge
speech about corporate takeovers.

325
00:19:11,010 --> 00:19:12,210
Holy shit,
we killed your friend.

326
00:19:13,327 --> 00:19:16,285
Look, we gotta know about corporate
takeovers tomorrow or we're screwed.

327
00:19:16,407 --> 00:19:20,161
Christ! We squished him like a bug! - Do you
know anything about corporate takeovers?

328
00:19:20,847 --> 00:19:24,760
- Well we can explain that to you
easily. - Yes, for a price. - What?

329
00:19:24,887 --> 00:19:26,479
- You know.
- Underpants?

330
00:19:26,607 --> 00:19:28,165
Underpants!

331
00:19:33,167 --> 00:19:35,317
Toto ladies and gentlemen!

332
00:19:39,447 --> 00:19:43,998
Alright and now before we all vote yes
on Prop Ten, here to remind us why

333
00:19:44,127 --> 00:19:46,806
are the loveable
innocent children.

334
00:19:48,127 --> 00:19:52,142
Since we are so concerned with the
corporate takeovers, we went and asked

335
00:19:52,143 --> 00:19:55,235
our friends the underpants gnomes and
they told us all about big corporations.

336
00:19:55,267 --> 00:19:59,476
Underpants gnomes? - Big corporations
are good. - What's this? - Good?

337
00:19:59,607 --> 00:20:02,666
Because without big corporations
we wouldn't have things

338
00:20:02,667 --> 00:20:04,167
like cars and computers
and canned soup.

339
00:20:04,287 --> 00:20:07,165
Even Harbucks coffee started
off as a small, little business.

340
00:20:07,287 --> 00:20:09,933
But because it made such great
coffee and because they ran

341
00:20:09,934 --> 00:20:12,171
their business so well, they
managed to grow and grow

342
00:20:12,172 --> 00:20:13,872
until it became the corporate
powerhouse it is today.

343
00:20:13,927 --> 00:20:17,124
And that's why we should
all let Harbucks stay.

344
00:20:20,047 --> 00:20:24,962
That's not what you said last time. - Well the
truth is we didn't write that paper last time.

345
00:20:25,707 --> 00:20:29,837
You little turds! You've
ruined my life for the last time!

346
00:20:34,607 --> 00:20:38,155
These boys are absolutely right.
We've been using these poor kids to pull

347
00:20:38,156 --> 00:20:40,256
at your heart strings for
our cause and it's wrong.

348
00:20:40,387 --> 00:20:42,742
We're as low and
despicable as Rob Reiner.

349
00:20:42,867 --> 00:20:44,723
You keep protesting
and complaining,

350
00:20:44,724 --> 00:20:48,724
but did any of you even bother
to taste Harbucks Coffee?

351
00:20:49,467 --> 00:20:52,016
Harbucks Coffee got to
where it is by being the best.

352
00:20:52,017 --> 00:20:55,017
Don't you think you
should at least try it?

353
00:20:58,907 --> 00:21:01,785
Hey, this is pretty damn good.

354
00:21:01,907 --> 00:21:06,185
Ya it doesn't have that bland, raw
sewage taste that Tweeks Coffee has.

355
00:21:08,867 --> 00:21:11,256
Hey, hey that is good.

356
00:21:11,387 --> 00:21:14,584
- It's a French Roast.
- It's suttle and mild.

357
00:21:14,707 --> 00:21:19,576
Mild like that first flash of sun on an April
morning. This is coffee the way it should be.

358
00:21:19,707 --> 00:21:22,522
Hey, no hard feelings
Tweek. Ya know,

359
00:21:22,523 --> 00:21:25,223
we still need some one to
run this Harbucks Coffe House.

360
00:21:25,347 --> 00:21:27,736
I'm sure it will
make a lot of money.

361
00:21:27,867 --> 00:21:29,951
Thank you Mr. Poston,
but I think we'll be fine

362
00:21:29,952 --> 00:21:32,952
with the money we make
selling our son into slavery.

363
00:21:33,427 --> 00:21:35,418
Just kidding son.

364
00:21:36,947 --> 00:21:38,700
I love you guys.



9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
