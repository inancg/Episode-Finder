1
00:00:37,487 --> 00:00:40,843
- It's a good thing we got her to the
hospital in time. - What's wrong with her?

2
00:00:40,967 --> 00:00:43,925
It's chickenpox. There seems to
be a small epidemic going around.

3
00:00:44,047 --> 00:00:46,705
Your daughter never had the
chickenpox as a little girl I take it?

4
00:00:46,706 --> 00:00:48,706
No, no, she's been
perfectly healthy.

5
00:00:48,807 --> 00:00:52,253
Well that's the problem. See chickenpox is
pretty normal thing with young children.

6
00:00:52,254 --> 00:00:56,054
As you get older it becomes a more
and more ferocious disease.

7
00:00:56,127 --> 00:01:01,963
- Shelley, looks who's come to visit you?
Your little brother Stan. - Oh whoopee!

8
00:01:02,087 --> 00:01:06,160
You know, most people don't realize
chickenpox is actually a form of herpes.

9
00:01:06,287 --> 00:01:09,165
- Dude, you got herpes on your face!
- Shut up, brat!

10
00:01:09,287 --> 00:01:11,482
- Will my daughter be ok?
- She'll be fine.

11
00:01:11,927 --> 00:01:15,203
- Stop it! - We just want to be
cautious and monitor her here.

12
00:01:17,287 --> 00:01:20,199
Come on Stanley, give your sister
a kiss, and then we have to go.

13
00:01:22,087 --> 00:01:24,785
And then the doctor said that it's
much worse as you get older.

14
00:01:24,786 --> 00:01:26,586
My daughter is in pretty
bad shape now,

15
00:01:26,687 --> 00:01:29,638
but if she were in her 20s,
she could die!

16
00:01:29,639 --> 00:01:32,939
My god, I never knew the chickenpox
was such a dangerous illness!

17
00:01:33,007 --> 00:01:35,202
I guess it's much better to
get it when you're young.

18
00:01:35,327 --> 00:01:38,544
So tell me if I'm crazy but I started
thinking that we should intentionally

19
00:01:38,545 --> 00:01:41,245
have our boys play with a child
who has the chickenpox.

20
00:01:41,367 --> 00:01:43,039
Let them get it now
while they're young.

21
00:01:43,167 --> 00:01:46,284
That's not crazy at all Sharon.
Mothers do it all the time.

22
00:01:46,407 --> 00:01:50,754
Ooh yes, when I was a child my mother
had me go over to a little girl's house

23
00:01:50,777 --> 00:01:55,556
who had the chickenpox, just so I would get
it. - So it's not such a crazy idea after all.

24
00:01:55,687 --> 00:02:00,124
No no no! And I'm pretty sure that strange
little boy Kenny has the chickenpox right now.

25
00:02:00,247 --> 00:02:01,599
-Are you guys having
a meeting or something?

26
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:05,500
How would you boys like to have a slumber
party at your little friend Kenny's House tonight?

27
00:02:05,687 --> 00:02:08,126
No way dude, Kenny's family is
poor. They live in the ghetto!

28
00:02:08,127 --> 00:02:09,827
Yeah, let's just have
a slumber party here.

29
00:02:09,927 --> 00:02:14,239
- Boys, you're going to sleep over at
Kenny's and that's final. - Oh weak!

30
00:02:15,167 --> 00:02:17,563
I wonder why our moms wanted us
to sleep over at Kenny's so bad.

31
00:02:17,564 --> 00:02:19,004
Yeah, it's pretty weird.

32
00:02:19,007 --> 00:02:21,760
All I can say is they
better have Nintendo.

33
00:02:22,647 --> 00:02:25,764
- Well here's Kenny's house.
- In the ghetto...

34
00:02:25,887 --> 00:02:31,860
on the cold and grey Chicago morning,
my little favorite child is born in the ghetto...

35
00:02:34,687 --> 00:02:36,305
We're here to have a
slumber party with Kenny.

36
00:02:36,306 --> 00:02:38,306
What? Don't you know
Kenny's sick with...

37
00:02:38,367 --> 00:02:43,600
That's the whole point, remember? Their moms
want them to catch it while they're young.

38
00:02:43,727 --> 00:02:47,242
- Catch what? - Nothing... come on in.
I was just making dinner.

39
00:02:47,367 --> 00:02:48,880
...and his mama cries...

40
00:02:49,007 --> 00:02:55,003
cause if it's... another bit of hunger for my
two feet in the ghetto... in the ghetto...

41
00:02:55,127 --> 00:02:56,401
- Cartman!
- What?

42
00:02:56,527 --> 00:02:59,133
Kenny! Your little friends are
here! Come play with them!

43
00:02:59,134 --> 00:03:00,806
But mom, I'm fucking sick!

44
00:03:00,807 --> 00:03:04,516
- I know you're sick, now get your
buns out here! - Heh heh heh... buns.

45
00:03:04,517 --> 00:03:06,017
Hey you guys,
what's going on?

46
00:03:06,087 --> 00:03:08,636
Whoa dude! You got
herpes on your face, too!

47
00:03:08,767 --> 00:03:12,555
- Where is the Ninendo?
- We don't have a Nintendo.

48
00:03:12,687 --> 00:03:15,997
We got a calico-vision plugged
into the black and white TV.

49
00:03:16,127 --> 00:03:17,879
Oh my god. This is like a
third world country.

50
00:03:18,007 --> 00:03:21,072
Throw your sleeping bags in Kenny's room
and then go grab some dinner.

51
00:03:21,073 --> 00:03:23,073
Oh good, I'm starving.

52
00:03:26,727 --> 00:03:29,321
Let's say grace.

53
00:03:29,687 --> 00:03:33,790
Lord... we thank you for this
staggering payload of frozen waffles

54
00:03:33,791 --> 00:03:37,443
that you have bestowed upon us.
And since we have been faithful to you,

55
00:03:37,444 --> 00:03:41,216
we know that you will send us some
good fortune one of these days,

56
00:03:41,217 --> 00:03:44,914
even though you sure as hell seem to
be taking your sweet time. Amen.

57
00:03:46,727 --> 00:03:49,241
Ok, let's dig in.

58
00:03:49,367 --> 00:03:50,846
That one's mine!
That one's mine!

59
00:03:50,967 --> 00:03:55,677
What kind of side dishes will we be enjoying
this evening with our frozen waffles?

60
00:03:57,047 --> 00:04:00,084
Am I to understand there
will be no side dishes?

61
00:04:00,207 --> 00:04:04,678
So Kyle, your dad still bringing home
those big fat lawyer paychecks?

62
00:04:04,807 --> 00:04:07,116
- I don't know.
- Stewart, don't even get started.

63
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:08,885
What, I'm just asking a question.

64
00:04:09,007 --> 00:04:11,654
You know your dad and I used to be
best friends when we were teenagers.

65
00:04:11,655 --> 00:04:13,555
We even worked
together at Pizza Shack.

66
00:04:13,567 --> 00:04:18,038
But he got promoted, went off to community
college, and I didn't. And you know why?

67
00:04:18,167 --> 00:04:21,000
- Cause your dad's Jewish!
- Heh. I heard that.

68
00:04:21,127 --> 00:04:24,773
That ain't why Stewart! It's because
you're an alcoholic retard,

69
00:04:24,774 --> 00:04:28,474
and he had dreams of not eating frozen
waffles for dinner every night!!

70
00:04:28,567 --> 00:04:30,440
Hey, is it my fault you don't
know how to cook?

71
00:04:30,441 --> 00:04:33,141
What am I supposed to do with
frozen waffles clamhead?

72
00:04:33,207 --> 00:04:34,762
You put em in the toaster,
you cook em!

73
00:04:34,763 --> 00:04:37,763
You just don't know how to
use spices and stuff.

74
00:04:37,847 --> 00:04:39,579
My waffle's done,
my waffle's done!

75
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:43,480
Now Kevin, we ain't go enough for everybody.
You have to split that with your brother.

76
00:04:43,487 --> 00:04:45,610
Oh geezes, are you
fucking killing me?

77
00:04:45,611 --> 00:04:48,511
Hey! We don't say fuck at the
table you little asshole!

78
00:04:48,647 --> 00:04:51,241
Yeah, we apparently don't
say sidedishes either.

79
00:04:51,367 --> 00:04:54,325
Kenny honey, if you're gonna
sneeze, sneeze on them.

80
00:04:58,447 --> 00:05:02,281
Man your family sucks ass Kenny. Whoever
heard of frozen waffles for dinner?

81
00:05:02,407 --> 00:05:06,161
Come on, let's just get in our sleeping
bags and get this night overwith.

82
00:05:10,527 --> 00:05:14,122
- Cartman, what the hell is that?
- It's my Urkel sleeping bag. Isn't it kewl?

83
00:05:14,247 --> 00:05:16,363
- No, it's not cool!
- Dude, I think I just saw a rat.

84
00:05:16,487 --> 00:05:19,047
Ah! You have rats in
your house too, Kenny?

85
00:05:19,167 --> 00:05:22,858
Dude seriously, you better stop being so poor
or else I'm gonna start hocking rocks at ya.

86
00:05:22,859 --> 00:05:24,547
I don't think it's very healthy
to sleep with rats.

87
00:05:24,548 --> 00:05:27,148
I don't think we have rats since
we put the fucking celing in.

88
00:05:35,287 --> 00:05:37,243
Ok let me see.

89
00:05:37,367 --> 00:05:40,404
- Oh goody you've got a fever!
- Goody? What do you mean goody?

90
00:05:40,527 --> 00:05:43,678
- Yep, it looks like you've got
chickenpox alright. - Chickenpox?

91
00:05:43,807 --> 00:05:47,436
- Oh no I must've caught it from Kenny
last night. - Oh gee, I guess you did.

92
00:05:47,567 --> 00:05:51,116
- Well, you sure seem happy about it.
- Alright, it's off to bed with you young man.

93
00:05:55,367 --> 00:05:59,997
- Don't scratch it, hon. - But mom
seriously it itches, I can't stand it!!

94
00:06:00,127 --> 00:06:02,846
- No, hon.
- Mom, seriously!!!

95
00:06:02,967 --> 00:06:06,357
- I got you some calamine lotion.
- I don't wanna.

96
00:06:06,487 --> 00:06:09,399
It'll make your itches go away.

97
00:06:11,087 --> 00:06:13,362
Ay give me that!

98
00:06:15,247 --> 00:06:18,921
Not too much hon. It says on the bottle
that too much can be bad.

99
00:06:18,922 --> 00:06:20,522
More calamine lotion!

100
00:06:23,327 --> 00:06:25,795
I don't understand it,
he's perfectly healthy.

101
00:06:25,927 --> 00:06:29,237
- Yeah, I feel great. -Are you sure
you stayed over at Kenny's house?

102
00:06:29,367 --> 00:06:31,532
Yeah dude. I told you we had
bread sandwiches for breakfast.

103
00:06:31,533 --> 00:06:34,021
- Did you sleep in the same room?
- Yes, why?

104
00:06:34,087 --> 00:06:37,603
Bobie, how would you like to spend the
night at your friend Kenny's house again?

105
00:06:37,727 --> 00:06:40,333
No way dude, it sucked ass.
They didn't even have cable.

106
00:06:40,334 --> 00:06:43,134
Well I think you need to spend
more time with your friends.

107
00:06:43,207 --> 00:06:45,342
Kenny's not really my friend ma.
I don't give a rat's ass about him.

108
00:06:45,343 --> 00:06:48,543
I'm gonna give
Mrs. McCormick a call.

109
00:06:48,847 --> 00:06:51,777
Hey dad, is it true that you and Kenny's dad
used to be best friends when you were young?

110
00:06:51,778 --> 00:06:54,085
Who Stewart? Yeah
yeah, I guess we were.

111
00:06:54,087 --> 00:06:57,026
Well how come Kenny's family eats frozen
waffles for dinner and has rats on the floor,

112
00:06:57,027 --> 00:06:58,727
while we have a big house
and lots of food?

113
00:06:58,847 --> 00:07:01,700
Well because Kenny's family doesn't
have as much money as we do.

114
00:07:01,701 --> 00:07:05,052
But why? If they're hungry and poor, why
don't we just give them half of our food?

115
00:07:06,647 --> 00:07:09,844
Boy have you got a lot to
learn. Sit down son.

116
00:07:09,967 --> 00:07:12,663
You see Kyle, we humans
work as a society.

117
00:07:12,664 --> 00:07:16,764
In order for a society to thrive
we need gods and clods.

118
00:07:16,847 --> 00:07:20,635
- Gods and clods? - Yes, you see I spen
a lot of time going to law school

119
00:07:20,767 --> 00:07:23,839
and I was able to go because I have
a slightly higher intelect than others.

120
00:07:23,967 --> 00:07:26,845
But I still need people to pump my
gas, and make my french fries,

121
00:07:26,846 --> 00:07:29,146
and fix my laundry machine
when it breaks down.

122
00:07:29,247 --> 00:07:31,920
- Ooh I see. Gods and clods.
- That's right,

123
00:07:32,047 --> 00:07:37,201
so Kenny's family is happy just the way they
are. And we're all a functioning part of America.

124
00:07:38,767 --> 00:07:41,235
Stanley, can I get you anything else?

125
00:07:43,447 --> 00:07:44,926
Stanley? Oh my god.

126
00:07:45,047 --> 00:07:48,198
Randy! Randy,
hurry he's burning up!

127
00:07:51,847 --> 00:07:55,920
- Don't you worry Stanley, you're going
to be ok. - Can I talk to you outside?

128
00:07:55,927 --> 00:07:58,999
- Kids, daddy and I are gonna
be right back, ok? - Ok.

129
00:07:59,127 --> 00:08:03,837
- Serves you right, you little brat. - At least
I'm not gonna die from it like you might!

130
00:08:03,967 --> 00:08:08,597
- If I die from this I'm taking you with
me! - Will Carol find out she's a...

131
00:08:08,727 --> 00:08:12,322
- I don't wanna watch this. I wanna watch
Terrance and Phillip. - We're watching this.

132
00:08:12,447 --> 00:08:14,124
Well I've got the
remote bitch!

133
00:08:14,447 --> 00:08:19,567
- Say Terrance would you check my ass
for abnormalities? - Sure thing Phillip.

134
00:08:19,927 --> 00:08:21,406
You got me again!

135
00:08:21,527 --> 00:08:23,541
That's tom foolery.

136
00:08:24,167 --> 00:08:26,556
- Give me the remote.
- No way dude.

137
00:08:26,687 --> 00:08:29,440
We're gonna watch
Terrance and Philllip all day.

138
00:08:29,567 --> 00:08:31,522
Get me outta here!

139
00:08:32,047 --> 00:08:34,880
He'll be ok. But it's a good idea
for us to monitor him for a while.

140
00:08:35,007 --> 00:08:38,317
- Oh god, what have we done?
- There there now, it's not your fault.

141
00:08:38,447 --> 00:08:41,891
Doctor, we purposely sent our
son to stay with a friend

142
00:08:41,892 --> 00:08:44,392
who had chickenpox so that
he would get it early.

143
00:08:44,407 --> 00:08:47,205
Ooh wow you did?

144
00:08:47,327 --> 00:08:49,277
Wow, you guys suck.

145
00:08:51,447 --> 00:08:55,042
- Can we go home now, mom? - No bubla,
you play with Kenny some more.

146
00:08:55,167 --> 00:08:58,241
But we've been playing for 8 hours!
We can't think of anything else to do.

147
00:08:58,242 --> 00:09:01,142
I've got a great game for you!
It's called Ookie-Mouth.

148
00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:04,085
- What's ooki-mouth? - First you
let Kenny spit in your mouth.

149
00:09:04,207 --> 00:09:08,041
Then you try to swallow his spit and try
to say ooki-mouth at the same time.

150
00:09:08,167 --> 00:09:11,716
- Sick, dude! - No no bobie,
it's loads of fun. Try it!

151
00:09:13,767 --> 00:09:16,645
- That outta take care of it.
- You want some more hot water?

152
00:09:16,767 --> 00:09:18,658
Oh no thank you,
it's terrific though!

153
00:09:18,659 --> 00:09:22,359
You don't have any tea bags or coffee
grounds to go in the tea bags do you?

154
00:09:22,487 --> 00:09:25,684
Ah, we don't care for that
hoidy, toydi, rich folks stuff.

155
00:09:25,807 --> 00:09:29,880
I see, well you certainly have
humble home Mrs. McCormick.

156
00:09:30,007 --> 00:09:33,602
Yeah well unfortunately my husband
is a washed up hunk of shit!

157
00:09:33,727 --> 00:09:36,844
- Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

158
00:09:36,967 --> 00:09:40,198
- Gross! I can't do it ma!
- Try again bobie!

159
00:09:41,527 --> 00:09:44,803
You know your husband and mine
used to work together as teenagers.

160
00:09:44,927 --> 00:09:47,487
Oh they was best friends.
You couldn't separate em.

161
00:09:47,607 --> 00:09:51,122
Really? I met Gerald in college,
so I didn't know.

162
00:09:51,247 --> 00:09:53,715
- What happened to them?
- Oh they just grew apart I guess.

163
00:09:53,767 --> 00:09:56,866
I think Stewart's a little jealous that
your husband got out of making pizzas

164
00:09:56,867 --> 00:09:58,667
and went on to make
something of hisself.

165
00:09:58,727 --> 00:10:01,985
Well that's too bad. I'm sure
your husband is a fine man.

166
00:10:01,986 --> 00:10:04,286
Oh hell no. He's a
nothin of deer turd.

167
00:10:04,367 --> 00:10:08,365
You say they were such good friends,
it's silly they don't even talk anymore.

168
00:10:08,366 --> 00:10:09,566
Let's get them together.

169
00:10:09,647 --> 00:10:13,242
- I don't know. - We'll just arrange a little
fishing trip for them or something.

170
00:10:13,367 --> 00:10:17,121
I can't say ookie mouth and have Kenny spit
down my throat at the same time. It's impossible.

171
00:10:17,247 --> 00:10:18,726
Practice makes perfect, bobie.

172
00:10:20,727 --> 00:10:23,366
Where's that calamine lotion?

173
00:10:23,487 --> 00:10:26,923
- Phillip, I got good news and bad news.
- Give it to me straight Terrance.

174
00:10:27,047 --> 00:10:30,198
- The good news is you have a clean
pail of health. - Oh what a relief!

175
00:10:30,327 --> 00:10:32,887
The bad news is you have cancer.

176
00:10:33,007 --> 00:10:35,726
- Cancer! - Yes, I'm afraid
your ass is collapsing.

177
00:10:35,847 --> 00:10:39,396
- My ass is collapsing!
- See this X-Ray? That's your ass.

178
00:10:39,527 --> 00:10:43,520
See that line? That's your ass
collapsing. Your ass is collapsing!

179
00:10:43,647 --> 00:10:45,777
Does this mean I won't be
able to fart anymore?

180
00:10:45,778 --> 00:10:48,255
No, it means you won't
be able to live anymore.

181
00:10:52,219 --> 00:10:53,719
Oh no!

182
00:10:54,327 --> 00:10:58,842
No kitty that's a...
wait a minute. Come here Kitty.

183
00:11:00,647 --> 00:11:05,846
- I'm back hon, I got some more calamine
lotion. - It's about friggin time! Give me that!

184
00:11:05,967 --> 00:11:09,676
Just use a little bit of that
stuff hon. It has to last a while.

185
00:11:24,327 --> 00:11:27,876
Ooh yess...you guys
seriosly now...ahhh...

186
00:11:31,367 --> 00:11:34,318
- I didn't know you liked to fish, Gerry.
- Oh yeah I love it.

187
00:11:34,447 --> 00:11:39,567
I haven't done it for a while though. I had to run
out a buy a few things. A rod and a reel and a...

188
00:11:41,087 --> 00:11:42,998
- Tackle box?
- Yeah! Tackle box.

189
00:11:43,927 --> 00:11:48,637
Man, smell that mountain air. What a great
Saturday morning. Aren't weekends just the best?

190
00:11:48,767 --> 00:11:52,999
- When you're uh unemployed, weekends
are meaningless. - Right, right right.

191
00:11:54,887 --> 00:12:00,757
And so children, that's how you tell a prostitute
from a policeman. Now are there any questions?

192
00:12:01,727 --> 00:12:04,764
- Yes Kyle. - What the hell does that
have to do with American history?

193
00:12:04,887 --> 00:12:07,685
That's a good question Kyle.
Are there any other questions?

194
00:12:07,807 --> 00:12:11,197
Mr. Garrison, I'm the only one here.
Everyone else has chicken herpes.

195
00:12:11,198 --> 00:12:12,598
Right, right.

196
00:12:12,727 --> 00:12:17,926
Well class, I'm gonna assign you all a
paper. The theme of the paper will be,

197
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:22,279
- "How I would make America better?". - What?
Does everybody have to do it or just me?

198
00:12:22,407 --> 00:12:25,828
Don't worry Kyle, I'm sending home
word to all the children who are out sick.

199
00:12:25,829 --> 00:12:27,329
They'll have to turn in a paper too.

200
00:12:27,407 --> 00:12:29,302
Homework?
But I'm in the hospital!

201
00:12:29,303 --> 00:12:32,103
Well your teacher sent this stuff over
for you to do while you're sick.

202
00:12:32,287 --> 00:12:34,562
That son of a bitch!
What kind of sick weirdo is he!?

203
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:38,824
Now Stanley, I know at your age teachers
can seem cold and heartless,

204
00:12:38,825 --> 00:12:41,925
but later you'll understand that he
did this for your own good.

205
00:12:42,047 --> 00:12:45,756
- Not Mr. Garrison ma, he really is a
sick weirdo. - Yeah, it's true, he is.

206
00:12:45,887 --> 00:12:49,880
- Oh. Well anyway, here's a pencil and
some paper. - Hey, where're you going?

207
00:12:50,007 --> 00:12:53,443
- We're going down to Happy Burger
for some milkshakes. - Milkshakes?

208
00:12:53,567 --> 00:12:56,616
- Yeah and then we're going to the movies!
- See ya, son!

209
00:12:57,327 --> 00:12:59,795
- Weak!
- So this is how America works.

210
00:12:59,927 --> 00:13:01,440
We have gods and clods.

211
00:13:01,567 --> 00:13:05,719
My dad says America needs both rich and
poor to survive, but I have a better idea.

212
00:13:05,847 --> 00:13:09,840
No I don't understand it Dr.
Schwartz, he's perfectly healthy.

213
00:13:09,967 --> 00:13:14,882
- He's been over at Kenny's house 3 days in a row,
and still hasn't caught the chickenpox. - What?

214
00:13:15,007 --> 00:13:18,982
I don't know what else to do. We sent the
other boys over and they all got sick,

215
00:13:18,983 --> 00:13:21,183
but I can't get my little
Kyle to catch it!

216
00:13:21,247 --> 00:13:24,125
- Oh my god! - Kyle! What
are you doing there honey?

217
00:13:24,247 --> 00:13:26,886
- You!
- I'll call you back Dr.Shwartz.

218
00:13:27,007 --> 00:13:29,601
- You!
- What bubala, what is it?

219
00:13:29,727 --> 00:13:33,402
You sent us over to Kenny's house on
purpose! You wanted us to get sick!

220
00:13:33,527 --> 00:13:38,203
Oy. It was for your own good Kyle. I wanted
you to get chickenpox while you were young.

221
00:13:38,327 --> 00:13:42,400
- Why? So I could be sitting in the hospital
waiting to die like Stan! - Now Kyle, come here.

222
00:13:42,527 --> 00:13:45,280
- You get away from me,
you crazy woman! - Oh boy.

223
00:13:48,807 --> 00:13:51,526
- Beer? - Oh no thanks,
I brought my own.

224
00:13:51,647 --> 00:13:56,026
Microbrew sampler from Aspen. Has 6
different beers from local breweries.

225
00:13:56,967 --> 00:14:01,200
Say, remember the time we built
the fort in your mom's back yard?

226
00:14:02,327 --> 00:14:08,257
- It took damned 2 years to finish it. - What
ever happened to that old hunk of junk?

227
00:14:08,487 --> 00:14:11,479
- That's where I live now.
- O, right.

228
00:14:11,607 --> 00:14:15,441
- And so that's why nightrider was the
best show in America. - Stan Stan!!

229
00:14:15,567 --> 00:14:18,127
- Wake her up and we're both dead.
- Sorry, sorry...

230
00:14:18,247 --> 00:14:19,953
You know how after we spent
the night at Kenny's house

231
00:14:19,954 --> 00:14:22,554
you and Cartman got
sick with chickenpox?

232
00:14:22,607 --> 00:14:25,758
- Dude, our parents sent us over there to
get us sick. - What are you talking about?

233
00:14:25,887 --> 00:14:27,695
They knew that staying at Kenny's
house would make us sick.

234
00:14:27,696 --> 00:14:29,796
- And they made us do it anyway.
- They did?

235
00:14:29,807 --> 00:14:32,037
- Yeah, and I think I figured out why.
- Why?

236
00:14:32,167 --> 00:14:35,443
- Because they're a bunch of
assholes. - Uh... of course!

237
00:14:35,567 --> 00:14:36,912
Come on dude, we
gotta get outta here.

238
00:14:36,913 --> 00:14:39,113
I don't know what they're planning
next, but it can't be good.

239
00:14:39,247 --> 00:14:43,798
I hope that one day America
can be more like Endor.

240
00:14:43,927 --> 00:14:48,239
Where the Ewats live.
Endor is very...

241
00:14:48,367 --> 00:14:50,119
Mom asnwer that!

242
00:14:50,247 --> 00:14:53,319
They have crazed
Ewats and barbeques,

243
00:14:53,447 --> 00:14:57,963
which is why I like Endor
more than America.

244
00:14:59,247 --> 00:15:02,202
Cartman, you remember how we all spent
the night at Kenny's a couple of days ago?

245
00:15:02,203 --> 00:15:04,403
I remember frozen waffles
with no sidedishes.

246
00:15:04,567 --> 00:15:07,525
Cartman, our parents sent us over
there to catch chickenpox from Kenny.

247
00:15:07,647 --> 00:15:09,956
Yeah, dude. Your mom wanted
you to have herpes on your face.

248
00:15:10,087 --> 00:15:12,726
- She what? - It's some kind
of parental conspiracy.

249
00:15:12,847 --> 00:15:15,156
- Our parents are trying to kill
us or something. - That bitch!

250
00:15:15,287 --> 00:15:18,004
I'm gonna go downstairs and
kick her square in the nuts!!

251
00:15:18,005 --> 00:15:20,505
No no no no. Come on fatass,
we're gonna get em all back.

252
00:15:20,607 --> 00:15:23,643
Well I'm sure you'll find another job soon.
Something will come along.

253
00:15:23,644 --> 00:15:25,544
It's not that easy.
You were lucky.

254
00:15:25,687 --> 00:15:27,240
Now now, I wasn't lucky.

255
00:15:27,241 --> 00:15:30,841
You had rich parents. You got to go to
that expensive community college.

256
00:15:30,967 --> 00:15:35,245
I worked my ASS off to get to where I
am today. I wanted to be somebody!

257
00:15:35,367 --> 00:15:39,326
I wanted to be somebody to! I just wasn't
born with a silver enima up my ass!

258
00:15:39,447 --> 00:15:42,962
You're just jealous! You're a bitter
old drunk just like your father!

259
00:15:43,087 --> 00:15:45,362
Now, don't make me
do that again.

260
00:15:45,767 --> 00:15:48,156
You son of a bitch!

261
00:15:50,767 --> 00:15:52,439
- Doctor?
- Yes.

262
00:15:52,567 --> 00:15:54,922
- Where's Stan?
- Stan?

263
00:15:55,047 --> 00:15:57,880
- Stan, our son.
- Oh yes, where's Stan?

264
00:15:58,007 --> 00:16:00,840
- You mean Stanley's missing?
- No no, he's not missing.

265
00:16:00,967 --> 00:16:03,527
We just, can't seem to
find him at this moment.

266
00:16:03,647 --> 00:16:07,276
- Oh my god, our son ran away!
- Will he be ok out of the hospital?

267
00:16:07,407 --> 00:16:09,625
Oh sure sure. But we have
to get him back soon,

268
00:16:09,626 --> 00:16:11,826
if he doesn't get his antibiotic
shot today, he could die.

269
00:16:11,927 --> 00:16:14,964
- Die!? - Yes die. It won't
be an easy death either.

270
00:16:15,087 --> 00:16:18,682
- The chickenpox will slowly move down his
trachea into his lungs... - Ok, well let's go look.

271
00:16:18,807 --> 00:16:21,788
...as he chokes for breath, the pox will
move through his inner ear into his brain

272
00:16:21,789 --> 00:16:23,289
making him think he's David Duchove...

273
00:16:23,319 --> 00:16:24,319
Ooh god no!

274
00:16:24,647 --> 00:16:27,391
- I'm sure he couldn't have gone far.
- ...now moving on all fours and wheezing

275
00:16:27,392 --> 00:16:31,572
uncontrollably his cellular structure will
regress in a deluctnous mass of....

276
00:16:32,207 --> 00:16:35,677
So how was it? Did you boys
have a good time fishing?

277
00:16:35,807 --> 00:16:38,958
- That son of a bitch ripped my
parka! - Catch anything?

278
00:16:39,087 --> 00:16:43,126
I just don't get it. Why would he invite me
fishing and turn into a complete bastard?

279
00:16:43,247 --> 00:16:47,798
Well darling, I have to tell you something.
He didn't invite you, I set the whole thing up.

280
00:16:47,927 --> 00:16:50,952
What? Now why the hell would you
knowingly deceive me like that?

281
00:16:50,953 --> 00:16:52,853
I thought it would be good for you.

282
00:16:52,927 --> 00:16:56,522
Just like you deceived our son into going
to Kenny's, and that didn't work either!

283
00:16:56,647 --> 00:16:59,002
I'm doing the best I can!

284
00:16:59,647 --> 00:17:04,516
My final solution by Kyle Broslofski. My dad is
the smartest guy in the whole wide world.

285
00:17:04,647 --> 00:17:07,480
He has taught me that all poor
people are actually things called clods.

286
00:17:07,607 --> 00:17:10,810
I wanna live in a world of only gods,
so my idea to make America better,

287
00:17:10,811 --> 00:17:12,647
is to put all poor
people into camps.

288
00:17:12,647 --> 00:17:14,285
- What?!?!
- If we get rid of them,

289
00:17:14,407 --> 00:17:15,709
there will be nothing
but rich people.

290
00:17:15,710 --> 00:17:18,000
And there won't be any hunger,
poverty, or homeless people.

291
00:17:18,007 --> 00:17:22,046
- Cause they'll all be dead. The end.
- Oh god, what have I done?

292
00:17:23,207 --> 00:17:27,564
- What's happening here Terrance? - We're
doing and anal transplant, it's our only hope.

293
00:17:27,687 --> 00:17:30,360
- Who's the doner?
- I am Phillip. I am.

294
00:17:30,487 --> 00:17:33,524
- Terrance, you're giving up your
ass for me? - Just half my ass.

295
00:17:33,567 --> 00:17:34,594
Can you believe it Phillip?

296
00:17:34,595 --> 00:17:37,795
Here we are best friends, and now
we're going to share the same ass.

297
00:17:37,847 --> 00:17:39,405
Oh damn it! Not now!

298
00:17:40,047 --> 00:17:42,132
Damn it! Children,
what are you doing here?

299
00:17:42,133 --> 00:17:44,122
Terrance and Phillip are
about to go into surgery!

300
00:17:44,127 --> 00:17:45,646
Chef, we wanna know about herpes.

301
00:17:45,647 --> 00:17:47,747
What makes you think I would
know anything about that?

302
00:17:47,807 --> 00:17:50,799
- I dunno, you're just the only grownup we
trust. - How does someone get herpes?

303
00:17:50,927 --> 00:17:54,158
Well you get by sharing things
with someone who already has it.

304
00:17:54,287 --> 00:17:56,939
You have to be very careful around
someone who has herpes.

305
00:17:56,940 --> 00:17:58,140
You know anybody with herpes?

306
00:17:58,247 --> 00:18:01,529
Well there's old Frita, down on main
street. She has a mouthful of herpes.

307
00:18:01,530 --> 00:18:02,830
You need to stay away from her.

308
00:18:02,927 --> 00:18:04,721
But what if we want to
give somebody herpes?

309
00:18:04,722 --> 00:18:06,922
Oh well then Frita's the
right person to go to.

310
00:18:07,007 --> 00:18:09,646
- Cool!
- Thanks Chef! - Ook!

311
00:18:10,127 --> 00:18:12,322
Wait a minute. What the
hell did I just do?

312
00:18:13,287 --> 00:18:15,005
- Stanley?
- Stan?

313
00:18:15,127 --> 00:18:18,802
- Oh Stanley, where are you?
- Stan?

314
00:18:21,327 --> 00:18:23,716
- Are you old Frita?
- Who wants to know?

315
00:18:23,847 --> 00:18:28,284
- Someone who has a favor.
- Ten dollars I'll leg, five dollars a nut.

316
00:18:28,727 --> 00:18:32,640
- We want you to give our
parents herpes. - Five dollars.

317
00:18:32,767 --> 00:18:34,595
My dad has five dollars
on top of his dresser.

318
00:18:35,496 --> 00:18:38,006
Stan you sound pretty sick, maybe
you should go back to the hospital.

319
00:18:38,047 --> 00:18:39,800
And have Shelley kick my ass?
No thanks.

320
00:18:39,801 --> 00:18:41,942
Plus I want to get my parents
back just as much as you do.

321
00:19:37,127 --> 00:19:40,802
- Thanks a lot Frita!
- Don't mention it.

322
00:19:41,807 --> 00:19:46,005
- Dude this is gonna be so killer. They're
all gonna get herpes. - Hooray!

323
00:19:46,687 --> 00:19:50,965
- Stanley, where the hell have you been?
- Damn it Stanley, you had us worried sick!

324
00:19:51,087 --> 00:19:54,796
- You have to get back to the hospital
for a shot! - I don't wanna go back there!

325
00:19:54,927 --> 00:19:56,440
Come on, we're taking you
back to the hospital.

326
00:19:56,567 --> 00:19:58,085
Don't you guys feel like
brushing your teeth first?

327
00:19:58,086 --> 00:19:59,586
- What? - You know,
freshen up your breath.

328
00:19:59,687 --> 00:20:04,203
- Oh man, I don't feel so good. - Oh good,
maybe you finally caught the chicken...

329
00:20:04,927 --> 00:20:06,724
Kyle!

330
00:20:10,447 --> 00:20:11,901
Well I hope you boys
learned your lesson.

331
00:20:11,924 --> 00:20:15,124
Going out and playing around with
chickenpox almost killed you all.

332
00:20:15,247 --> 00:20:17,556
- We're sorry.  - Well just be
thankful we got you here in time.

333
00:20:17,687 --> 00:20:19,287
Your parents are here to
see you, I'll send them in.

334
00:20:19,288 --> 00:20:21,688
This itches, give me some of that
calamine lotion, Cartman.

335
00:20:21,727 --> 00:20:25,561
- Heeelll no, you guys get your own!
- Stanley, how are you feeling today, son?

336
00:20:25,687 --> 00:20:28,724
- Pretty good. - The doctor says that
maybe you can go home tomorrow.

337
00:20:28,847 --> 00:20:31,520
- Yeah, isn't that great Stanley?
- Wow cool!

338
00:20:31,647 --> 00:20:33,556
- And how are you Kyle?
- Are you doing ok?

339
00:20:34,087 --> 00:20:35,896
I'm better now!

340
00:20:36,527 --> 00:20:38,199
What's so funny, you two?

341
00:20:38,327 --> 00:20:41,364
- We gave you guys herpes!
- What what what!? You did this?

342
00:20:41,487 --> 00:20:45,321
We got you back for getting us sick! We had
a prostitute use her toothbrushes and stuff.

343
00:20:45,447 --> 00:20:49,235
I can't believe you gave us
herpes. You little rascals!

344
00:20:49,367 --> 00:20:50,755
Well I guess it serves us right.

345
00:20:50,756 --> 00:20:54,156
Kids, we should've been honest about
wanting you to get chickenpox.

346
00:20:54,287 --> 00:20:56,733
It's true, we were wrong
for deceiving you about it.

347
00:20:56,734 --> 00:20:59,634
Hey how come you don't have
sores on your lips mom?

348
00:20:59,727 --> 00:21:02,366
- Ooh, I have them somewhere
else poopykins. - Hooray!

349
00:21:02,487 --> 00:21:04,874
And uh Stewart, I think
I owe you an appology.

350
00:21:04,875 --> 00:21:08,975
I realized I shouldn't be so cold towards
people that are less fortunate than me.

351
00:21:09,087 --> 00:21:13,762
- Oh hell I'm sorry too. - Oh Phillip, I'm
glad everything turned out for the better.

352
00:21:15,287 --> 00:21:18,006
- Well I know one thing for sure.
- What's that Eric?

353
00:21:18,127 --> 00:21:21,681
We're all gonna need
more calamine lotion.

354
00:21:28,527 --> 00:21:31,678
- Oh my god! They killed Kenny!
- You bastards!
