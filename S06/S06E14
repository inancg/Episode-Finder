14
00:00:34,901 --> 00:00:36,901
You wanted to see me,
principal victoria?

15
00:00:36,936 --> 00:00:38,666
Yes, mr. Garrison,
have a seat.

16
00:00:38,701 --> 00:00:41,284
Mr. Garrison, some time ago
you asked to be promoted

17
00:00:41,319 --> 00:00:43,868
From teaching kindergarten
back to the 3rd grade.

18
00:00:43,903 --> 00:00:45,199
I'm aware of that.

19
00:00:45,234 --> 00:00:47,917
I want to come clean with you
and tell you that back then

20
00:00:47,952 --> 00:00:50,601
Some of us were uncomfortable
with your sexual preferences.

21
00:00:50,636 --> 00:00:52,868
It was wrong of us, and i
want to make it up to you.

22
00:00:52,903 --> 00:00:54,732
Wow, that's really
great to hear.

23
00:00:54,767 --> 00:00:56,467
As you know, the position
of 4th grade teacher

24
00:00:56,502 --> 00:00:57,866
Has become available,

25
00:00:57,901 --> 00:00:59,834
<i>And we'd like to
offer you the job.</i>

26
00:00:59,869 --> 00:01:01,732
Oh, for real?!
You're not kidding?

27
00:01:01,767 --> 00:01:02,968
We in administration see now
that you are an individual

28
00:01:03,003 --> 00:01:06,300
With your own preferences,
and we respect that.

29
00:01:06,335 --> 00:01:08,167
Oh, this is all just-
A dream come true!

30
00:01:08,202 --> 00:01:10,234
Thank you,
principal victoria!

31
00:01:10,269 --> 00:01:11,284
I'll do a great job!

32
00:01:11,319 --> 00:01:12,265
I know you will!

33
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:14,365
You're sure
this for real?

34
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:17,167
I mean, i'm not just gonna get
fired again for being gay tomorrow?

35
00:01:17,202 --> 00:01:18,834
It's for real,
mr. Garrison.

36
00:01:18,869 --> 00:01:20,032
Oh, great!

37
00:01:20,067 --> 00:01:20,965
With all the
new laws

38
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,466
We could never fire you
for being gay now-

39
00:01:22,501 --> 00:01:24,200
You'd be able to sue us
for millions of dollars.

40
00:01:24,235 --> 00:01:25,165
Right, i-

41
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:28,132
What, what was that?

42
00:01:28,167 --> 00:01:30,067
Well, i was just saying that the
policies have really changed.

43
00:01:30,102 --> 00:01:33,132
You know, if we fired you
for acting gay next time,

44
00:01:33,167 --> 00:01:37,067
You'd be able to sue the school
district for lots of money.

45
00:01:37,102 --> 00:01:38,232
Oh, right, right.

46
00:01:38,267 --> 00:01:41,399
How, how much
money exactly?

47
00:01:41,434 --> 00:01:43,800
Oh, well, there was the
case out in minnesota

48
00:01:43,835 --> 00:01:46,167
Where the guy was awarded
25 million i think.

49
00:01:46,202 --> 00:01:48,265
You-You don't say.

50
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:52,167
Well, thanks,
principal victoria.

51
00:01:52,202 --> 00:01:54,799
Holy moly!

52
00:01:54,834 --> 00:01:57,601
I've gotta find a way to
get fired for being gay!

53
00:01:59,868 --> 00:02:02,467
M'kay, kids, i know the past few
weeks have been really hard

54
00:02:02,502 --> 00:02:05,868
With the death of your
teacher, ms. Choksondik.

55
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:08,766
That's funny!

56
00:02:08,801 --> 00:02:12,033
But the principal has finally
hired a teacher to take her place.

57
00:02:12,068 --> 00:02:15,001
So i want you all to
give your best behavior

58
00:02:15,036 --> 00:02:17,934
To your new 4th grade teacher,
mr. Garrison.

59
00:02:17,969 --> 00:02:19,301
Awwww!

60
00:02:19,336 --> 00:02:20,599
Not him!

61
00:02:20,634 --> 00:02:21,934
Thank you,
mr. Mackey.

62
00:02:21,969 --> 00:02:23,666
Good luck, m'kay.

63
00:02:23,701 --> 00:02:25,767
Okay, children, now for
those of you who are new,

64
00:02:25,802 --> 00:02:28,051
My name is
mr. Garrison.

65
00:02:28,086 --> 00:02:30,265
Where's mr. Hat, sir?

66
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:31,767
Well, i was informed
that 4th graders

67
00:02:31,802 --> 00:02:33,199
Are a little too old
for mr. Hat.

68
00:02:33,234 --> 00:02:35,766
Two-Year-Olds are
too old for mr. Hat.

69
00:02:35,801 --> 00:02:38,634
But it's okay, because i found
a new teacher's assistant.

70
00:02:38,669 --> 00:02:41,734
Say hello to-
Mr. Slave.

71
00:02:41,769 --> 00:02:43,300
Hi, kids.

72
00:02:43,335 --> 00:02:44,998
Hmm.

73
00:02:45,033 --> 00:02:47,998
So that's mr. Slave,
the teacher's assistant.

74
00:02:48,033 --> 00:02:52,934
Or, as i like to write for
short- The teacher's ass.

75
00:02:52,969 --> 00:02:54,432
Oh, jesus christ.

76
00:02:54,467 --> 00:02:56,300
Okay, mr. Slave, go sit
until i need you.

77
00:02:56,335 --> 00:02:58,732
Ah!

78
00:02:58,767 --> 00:03:02,065
Dude, i think that mr. Slave
guy might be a- Pakistani.

79
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:04,834
I'm not saying the rest of the
school year is going to be easy.

80
00:03:04,869 --> 00:03:07,267
In fact, it's going
to be long and hard-

81
00:03:07,302 --> 00:03:09,601
<i>Really long
and really hard.</i>

82
00:03:09,636 --> 00:03:10,965
Oh, jesus christ.

83
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,167
The first thing we're gonna
be learning about

84
00:03:13,202 --> 00:03:15,666
Is communist russia.

85
00:03:15,701 --> 00:03:17,467
No, kenny- What are you
doing, kenny?

86
00:03:17,502 --> 00:03:19,234
Now, stalin was a big
silly when he...

87
00:03:19,269 --> 00:03:21,599
Kenny, no!
Don't do it, kenny!

88
00:03:21,634 --> 00:03:23,234
Eric, did you just throw
a paper airplane?!

89
00:03:23,269 --> 00:03:25,299
No, it was kenny!

90
00:03:25,334 --> 00:03:26,432
Very funny, eric,
kenny's dead!

91
00:03:26,467 --> 00:03:28,466
Yeah, but cartman
drank kenny's remains

92
00:03:28,501 --> 00:03:30,267
And now kenny's soul is
trapped in cartman's body.

93
00:03:30,302 --> 00:03:31,432
Yeah!

94
00:03:31,467 --> 00:03:32,632
That does it!

95
00:03:32,667 --> 00:03:35,033
I will not put up with
foolishness in my class!

96
00:03:35,068 --> 00:03:37,934
It's time
for punishment.

97
00:03:37,969 --> 00:03:39,835
Take it, mr. Slave!

98
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:41,666
Oh!
Oh, it hurts!

99
00:03:41,701 --> 00:03:43,300
I will not put up
with tomfoolery

100
00:03:43,335 --> 00:03:44,499
In my classroom,
children!

101
00:03:44,534 --> 00:03:47,734
Mr. Slave, put this rubber
ball in your mouth.

102
00:03:47,769 --> 00:03:51,299
Take that, slave,
take it!

103
00:03:51,334 --> 00:03:53,300
This should get me
fired for sure!

104
00:03:53,335 --> 00:03:55,766
I really enjoyed
the imagery

105
00:03:55,801 --> 00:03:57,199
In the last chapter
of this month's book.

106
00:03:57,234 --> 00:03:59,701
Yes, and i really saw the
entire book, thematically,

107
00:03:59,736 --> 00:04:01,318
As a take on
corporate america.

108
00:04:01,353 --> 00:04:02,866
I think in the
fourth chapter,

109
00:04:02,901 --> 00:04:04,167
When nancy drew discovers
the bloody glove

110
00:04:04,202 --> 00:04:06,432
In the cheerleader's locker,

111
00:04:06,467 --> 00:04:08,167
That was just a brilliantly
written passage.

112
00:04:08,202 --> 00:04:09,432
So full of metaphor!

113
00:04:09,467 --> 00:04:10,984
Hey guys,
can we talk to you?

114
00:04:11,019 --> 00:04:12,501
Oh, hi, boys!
How was school?

115
00:04:12,536 --> 00:04:13,734
Uh, not cool.

116
00:04:13,769 --> 00:04:14,799
Great.

117
00:04:14,834 --> 00:04:15,968
We're having our book-Of-
The-Month club meeting,

118
00:04:16,003 --> 00:04:17,485
So why don't you boys
go outside and play.

119
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:18,933
Was it me or did you all
think that nancy drew

120
00:04:18,968 --> 00:04:20,467
Solved the riddle of elephant
mountain a little too easily?

121
00:04:20,502 --> 00:04:22,032
Oh yes.
For sure.

122
00:04:22,067 --> 00:04:23,434
No, no,
he said not cool.

123
00:04:23,469 --> 00:04:24,766
We got our new
teacher today.

124
00:04:24,801 --> 00:04:26,334
It's mr. Garrison,
our old 3rd grade teacher.

125
00:04:26,369 --> 00:04:27,566
Uh-Huh.

126
00:04:27,601 --> 00:04:28,501
Well, he has this new
teacher's assistant,

127
00:04:28,536 --> 00:04:30,701
And they're both-
Totally gay.

128
00:04:30,736 --> 00:04:32,232
Kyle!

129
00:04:32,267 --> 00:04:34,534
You know better than to
discriminate against homosexuals!

130
00:04:34,569 --> 00:04:36,267
Yeah, but these guys
are really super gay.

131
00:04:36,302 --> 00:04:38,998
I'm surprised
at you, stanley.

132
00:04:39,033 --> 00:04:41,133
<i>I really thought you knew how to
accept people for who they were.</i>

133
00:04:41,168 --> 00:04:42,417
Yeah, but, dad-

134
00:04:42,452 --> 00:04:43,632
No buts, stanley.

135
00:04:43,667 --> 00:04:45,132
We're not raising our kids
to be discriminators.

136
00:04:45,167 --> 00:04:46,834
That's right, i think it's time
you kids took a little trip

137
00:04:46,869 --> 00:04:50,133
To the museum
of tolerance.

138
00:04:52,634 --> 00:04:54,532
Welcome to the
museum of tolerance.

139
00:04:54,567 --> 00:04:56,567
Here we try to educate you
on the dynamics

140
00:04:56,602 --> 00:04:58,167
Of racism and prejudice
in america.

141
00:05:00,734 --> 00:05:01,965
Ow!

142
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,866
Now, did you know that words
we use can show intolerance?

143
00:05:04,901 --> 00:05:07,767
Let's begin our tour with a walk
through our "tunnel of prejudice"

144
00:05:07,802 --> 00:05:09,300
To show you what
it can feel like

145
00:05:09,335 --> 00:05:13,100
To be discriminated
against.

146
00:05:13,135 --> 00:05:14,968
Queer!

147
00:05:15,003 --> 00:05:16,101
Beaner!

148
00:05:16,136 --> 00:05:17,735
Chink!

149
00:05:17,770 --> 00:05:19,302
Nigger!

150
00:05:19,337 --> 00:05:20,302
Heeb!

151
00:05:20,337 --> 00:05:21,902
Faggot!

152
00:05:21,937 --> 00:05:23,432
Cracker!

153
00:05:23,467 --> 00:05:25,667
Oh man,
this is awesome!

154
00:05:25,702 --> 00:05:27,833
Now you know
how it feels.

155
00:05:27,868 --> 00:05:30,965
I wanna ride again!
I wanna ride again!

156
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,701
We are now entering the
"hall of stereotypes".

157
00:05:33,736 --> 00:05:35,499
These wax figures represent

158
00:05:35,534 --> 00:05:37,899
How some intolerant people
have labeled minorities.

159
00:05:37,934 --> 00:05:41,384
Here, we see a black person
eating chicken and watermelon,

160
00:05:41,419 --> 00:05:44,834
A stereotype that hurts the
african-American community.

161
00:05:44,869 --> 00:05:47,335
What other stereotypes
do you see here?

162
00:05:47,370 --> 00:05:49,285
Ah, here's the arab
as a terrorist.

163
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:51,165
That's right,
but of course we know

164
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:53,501
That not all arabs are
terrorists, don't we, kids?

165
00:05:53,536 --> 00:05:55,818
Well, there's an asian man
with a calculator.

166
00:05:55,853 --> 00:05:58,065
That's right, not all
stereotypes are negative.

167
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:01,133
But even a positive one, like
"all asians are good at math"

168
00:06:01,168 --> 00:06:02,901
Is harmful to society.

169
00:06:02,936 --> 00:06:04,468
Look!
A covetous jew!

170
00:06:04,503 --> 00:06:05,965
Very good, young man.

171
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,934
The idea that jews are
only interested in money

172
00:06:07,969 --> 00:06:09,235
Is very old indeed.

173
00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:10,466
Ah, here's a good one.

174
00:06:10,501 --> 00:06:12,367
It's the stereotypical
"sleepy mexican".

175
00:06:12,402 --> 00:06:13,632
Wha- What?

176
00:06:13,667 --> 00:06:15,065
Oh man,
what time is it?

177
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:16,200
I'm sorry, i thought
you were a wax sculpture.

178
00:06:16,235 --> 00:06:18,332
No, man,
i'm the janitor.

179
00:06:18,367 --> 00:06:20,167
I'm supposed to be cleaning
but i'm so tired.

180
00:06:20,202 --> 00:06:22,466
Ooh, i so sleepy.

181
00:06:22,501 --> 00:06:24,165
This is our
discovery wing.

182
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:26,634
Take your time at the computer
displays, because you see,

183
00:06:26,669 --> 00:06:28,532
Being tolerant
you must also learn

184
00:06:28,567 --> 00:06:31,184
To respect people who are small,
people who are disabled,

185
00:06:31,219 --> 00:06:33,801
Even people who are overweight,
like this young man here.

186
00:06:33,836 --> 00:06:34,965
Ay!

187
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,367
You other boys have probably
called this young man names

188
00:06:36,402 --> 00:06:39,067
Like "tubby", or "lard butt"
or "fat tits".

189
00:06:39,102 --> 00:06:40,401
Fat tits-
That's a good one.

190
00:06:40,436 --> 00:06:41,666
Yeah, have to
remember that.

191
00:06:41,701 --> 00:06:43,734
But you must learn be tolerant
of his differences as well.

192
00:06:43,769 --> 00:06:45,567
If he chooses
to eat fatty foods,

193
00:06:45,602 --> 00:06:47,133
That's his life choice.

194
00:06:47,168 --> 00:06:49,265
I'm not fat...

195
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:50,899
I have a different
life choice.

196
00:06:50,934 --> 00:06:52,550
And we won't belittle you
for eating

197
00:06:52,585 --> 00:06:54,167
Lots of cookies
and cakes and pies.

198
00:06:54,202 --> 00:06:55,133
Dude, tolerance
kicks ass!

199
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:58,532
That's our cartman.

200
00:06:58,567 --> 00:06:59,799
Well, that's the end
of our tour.

201
00:06:59,834 --> 00:07:02,334
Now do you see why tolerance
is so important, boys?

202
00:07:02,369 --> 00:07:03,799
I guess.

203
00:07:03,834 --> 00:07:05,234
We have to accept people
for who they are

204
00:07:05,269 --> 00:07:06,632
And what they like to do.

205
00:07:06,667 --> 00:07:08,334
Hey! What the hell
are you doing?!

206
00:07:08,369 --> 00:07:09,666
I was just-

207
00:07:09,701 --> 00:07:10,534
There's no smoking
in the museum!

208
00:07:10,569 --> 00:07:12,365
But i'm not
in the museum.

209
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:13,200
Get out of here,
you filthy smoker!

210
00:07:13,235 --> 00:07:15,399
Yeah,
dirty lungs!

211
00:07:15,434 --> 00:07:17,234
Go ahead and kill yourself,
stupid tar breath!

212
00:07:17,269 --> 00:07:19,732
Dumbass!
Get outta here!

213
00:07:19,767 --> 00:07:21,065
Well, have a great day,
everybody.

214
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:23,100
Now you boys can go and give
your teacher and assistant

215
00:07:23,135 --> 00:07:25,300
The respect they
deserve, right?

216
00:07:25,335 --> 00:07:26,968
Yeah.

217
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:30,732
Okay, children,
let's take our seats.

218
00:07:30,767 --> 00:07:33,534
Apparently none of you tried
to get me fired yesterday,

219
00:07:33,569 --> 00:07:35,367
So i guess we're just
gonna have to go on

220
00:07:35,402 --> 00:07:36,799
And learn more today.

221
00:07:36,834 --> 00:07:38,517
Now, who can tell me
what happens to water

222
00:07:38,552 --> 00:07:40,200
When we heat it up
in the bunsen burner?

223
00:07:40,235 --> 00:07:41,551
It evaporates!

224
00:07:41,586 --> 00:07:42,833
Good, butters.

225
00:07:42,868 --> 00:07:44,400
Now, if we take the glass tube
of the bunsen burner,

226
00:07:44,435 --> 00:07:46,618
We can also see how
other things react.

227
00:07:46,653 --> 00:07:48,727
Evaporation is an
exothermic reaction-

228
00:07:48,762 --> 00:07:50,801
So now let's look at
an endothermic one.

229
00:07:50,836 --> 00:07:52,199
Mr. Slave,
position 7, please.

230
00:07:52,234 --> 00:07:55,901
Now i'm gonna put the glass
tube into mr. Slave's tight ass.

231
00:07:55,936 --> 00:07:57,432
The heat from
mr. Slave's ass

232
00:07:57,467 --> 00:07:59,400
Will act as our new
conductor of energy.

233
00:07:59,435 --> 00:08:00,998
Ahh!

234
00:08:01,033 --> 00:08:02,065
Okay, now butters,

235
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:04,267
Could you bring over
lemmiwinks for me, please?

236
00:08:04,302 --> 00:08:06,599
Sure!

237
00:08:06,634 --> 00:08:09,132
Oh, no.
No, no, no, no, no.

238
00:08:09,167 --> 00:08:11,033
Newton was the first to discover
that for every action

239
00:08:11,068 --> 00:08:12,834
There is a reaction-
Thank you, butters-

240
00:08:12,869 --> 00:08:14,566
Now what do you think
is gonna happen

241
00:08:14,601 --> 00:08:17,751
When i introduce the
element of the gerbil

242
00:08:17,786 --> 00:08:20,901
To the endothermic heat
of mr. Slave's ass?

243
00:08:20,936 --> 00:08:22,234
Well, let's see.

244
00:08:22,269 --> 00:08:24,567
Ahh!

245
00:08:28,501 --> 00:08:31,567
Oh, jesus.
Jesus christ!

246
00:08:31,602 --> 00:08:33,133
Lemmiwinks, no!

247
00:08:36,767 --> 00:08:38,434
Hello there,
children!

248
00:08:38,469 --> 00:08:40,032
Hey, chef!

249
00:08:40,067 --> 00:08:41,267
How's it going?
Bad.

250
00:08:41,302 --> 00:08:42,499
Why bad?

251
00:08:42,534 --> 00:08:44,100
Chef,
we're intolerant.

252
00:08:44,135 --> 00:08:46,051
Intolerant of who?

253
00:08:46,086 --> 00:08:47,933
Gays, i guess.

254
00:08:47,968 --> 00:08:49,567
Now why do you wanna go
be intolerant

255
00:08:49,602 --> 00:08:51,001
Of gay people,
children?

256
00:08:51,036 --> 00:08:52,385
I thought you knew
better!

257
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:53,699
Well, we didn't
think we were,

258
00:08:53,734 --> 00:08:55,117
But mr. Garrison has
this new assistant,

259
00:08:55,152 --> 00:08:56,501
And we're really
uncomfortable around them.

260
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:57,899
Children,
a lot of times,

261
00:08:57,934 --> 00:08:59,534
The reason people get
uncomfortable around gay people

262
00:08:59,569 --> 00:09:01,165
Is that they have
some issues themselves.

263
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,033
You have to ask yourself,
"what is it about their behavior

264
00:09:03,068 --> 00:09:06,334
That for some reason
makes me uncomfortable?"

265
00:09:06,369 --> 00:09:07,566
Well, i guess
it's mostly the way

266
00:09:07,601 --> 00:09:10,434
Mr. Garrison stuck a gerbil
up mr. Slave's ass.

267
00:09:10,469 --> 00:09:11,499
Right, and you see,
children,

268
00:09:11,534 --> 00:09:14,300
That's why you need to-
Whoa, what?!

269
00:09:14,335 --> 00:09:15,599
Are we
homophobes now?

270
00:09:15,634 --> 00:09:16,965
We don't wanna be
gay bashers, chef!

271
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,467
Children, there's a big
difference between gay people

272
00:09:19,502 --> 00:09:21,098
And mr. Garrison.

273
00:09:21,133 --> 00:09:22,200
Do you
understand that?

274
00:09:22,235 --> 00:09:23,466
No.

275
00:09:23,501 --> 00:09:24,632
You children just
take your lunches.

276
00:09:24,667 --> 00:09:26,267
I'm gonna have a talk
with the principal.

277
00:09:26,302 --> 00:09:27,734
I'll take three
lunches today, please.

278
00:09:27,769 --> 00:09:29,167
You don't need
three lunches, eric,

279
00:09:29,202 --> 00:09:30,617
You're fat enough
as it is.

280
00:09:30,652 --> 00:09:31,998
It is my
life choice, chef,

281
00:09:32,033 --> 00:09:35,067
And if you don't tolerate it
i'll report you to the s.C.C.

282
00:09:36,334 --> 00:09:38,666
That was a brilliant idea

283
00:09:38,701 --> 00:09:40,400
Having me put a gerbil
up your ass, mr. Slave!

284
00:09:40,435 --> 00:09:42,165
Now we'll get fired
for sure!

285
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:45,165
Well, it wasn't the first
small animal i put up my ass.

286
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,868
Mr. Garrison to the
principal's office, please.

287
00:09:47,903 --> 00:09:48,732
That's it!

288
00:09:48,767 --> 00:09:50,534
They're gonna fire me
for being gay!

289
00:09:50,569 --> 00:09:52,518
25 million,
here we come!

290
00:09:52,553 --> 00:09:54,467
Don't forget,
i get half!

291
00:09:54,502 --> 00:09:56,499
Ooh!

292
00:09:56,534 --> 00:09:59,133
Ooh, jesus christ.

293
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:11,334
Lemmiwinks, you must find
your way out of this place

294
00:10:11,369 --> 00:10:13,699
Or you will surely die.

295
00:10:13,734 --> 00:10:15,517
This way has been closed off
by the great sphincter.

296
00:10:15,552 --> 00:10:17,300
To escape, you must journey
upward through dark reaches

297
00:10:17,335 --> 00:10:20,100
Of the intestine
and past the stomach.

298
00:10:20,135 --> 00:10:22,232
Who am i?
Just a friend.

299
00:10:22,267 --> 00:10:24,167
Heed my words, lemmiwinks,
your time is running out.

300
00:10:24,202 --> 00:10:26,218
Make for the
large intestine.

301
00:10:26,253 --> 00:10:28,234
All will be
made clear then.

302
00:10:33,901 --> 00:10:38,032
* a great adventure
is waiting for you ahead *

303
00:10:38,067 --> 00:10:43,666
* hurry onward, lemmiwinks
or you will soon be dead *

304
00:10:43,701 --> 00:10:46,100
* the journey before you may be
long and filled with woe *

305
00:10:46,135 --> 00:10:48,300
* but you must escape
the gay man's ass *

306
00:10:48,335 --> 00:10:51,799
* so your tale
can be told *

307
00:10:51,834 --> 00:10:55,367
* lemmiwinks, lemmiwinks
lemmiwinks, lemmiwinks *

308
00:10:55,402 --> 00:10:57,601
* doot doot doot
do do doo *

309
00:10:57,636 --> 00:10:59,766
* doot doo do doo

310
00:10:59,801 --> 00:11:01,667
You wanted to see me,
principal victoria?

311
00:11:01,702 --> 00:11:03,584
Oh, yes, mr. Garrison,
have a seat.

312
00:11:03,619 --> 00:11:05,610
Oh dear, sounds like
i'm getting fired.

313
00:11:05,645 --> 00:11:07,566
* doot doot doot doot
do-Do-Do doo *

314
00:11:07,601 --> 00:11:09,734
Mr. Garrison, chef has
brought it to my attention

315
00:11:09,769 --> 00:11:11,868
That some of the students
are a bit... uncomfortable

316
00:11:11,903 --> 00:11:14,033
About certain aspects of
your teaching methods.

317
00:11:14,068 --> 00:11:15,566
Oh, no,
you're firing me?!

318
00:11:15,601 --> 00:11:17,800
Oh well, i can't stop
being who i am.

319
00:11:17,835 --> 00:11:20,000
I can't help the way
god made me.

320
00:11:20,035 --> 00:11:21,799
Guess i just have to go!

321
00:11:21,834 --> 00:11:23,467
No, no, no!
We're not firing you.

322
00:11:23,502 --> 00:11:24,666
You're not?

323
00:11:24,701 --> 00:11:27,033
No, we're sending chef
to a tolerance seminar.

324
00:11:27,068 --> 00:11:29,384
Sending chef to
a tolerance seminar?!

325
00:11:29,419 --> 00:11:31,666
You got to be
crazy!

326
00:11:31,701 --> 00:11:33,200
You've demonstrated
a lack of tolerance

327
00:11:33,235 --> 00:11:34,699
For mr. Garrison's
behavior.

328
00:11:34,734 --> 00:11:36,834
In fact, i believe you
used to words "sick queer"

329
00:11:36,869 --> 00:11:38,534
To describe his
conduct in class.

330
00:11:38,569 --> 00:11:40,133
He is a sick queer!

331
00:11:40,168 --> 00:11:41,299
Yeah!

332
00:11:41,334 --> 00:11:42,732
I just wanted to give you
an opportunity

333
00:11:42,767 --> 00:11:44,267
To apologize to mr.Garrison
before i sent you away, chef.

334
00:11:44,302 --> 00:11:48,466
Kiss my black ass!

335
00:11:48,501 --> 00:11:50,868
Parents, i had to call you
in here because your boys

336
00:11:50,903 --> 00:11:52,899
Have refused
to attend class

337
00:11:52,934 --> 00:11:54,800
With their homosexual
teachers, m'kay.

338
00:11:54,835 --> 00:11:56,667
We're not staying in class
another minute

339
00:11:56,702 --> 00:11:57,833
With those queermos!

340
00:11:57,868 --> 00:11:59,534
Well, i really thought
you boys learned something

341
00:11:59,569 --> 00:12:00,751
At the museum of tolerance.

342
00:12:00,786 --> 00:12:01,899
But apparently
all you learned

343
00:12:01,934 --> 00:12:03,634
Was new words to call
your poor teachers!

344
00:12:03,669 --> 00:12:05,068
But they killed
lemmiwinks!

345
00:12:05,103 --> 00:12:06,585
Shut your mouth,
butters!

346
00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:08,067
You'll speak
when spoken to!

347
00:12:08,102 --> 00:12:09,432
Yes, sir.

348
00:12:09,467 --> 00:12:10,400
Mr. Mackey, we've done
everything we can

349
00:12:10,435 --> 00:12:12,118
To raise compassionate
children.

350
00:12:12,153 --> 00:12:13,766
We don't know
where else to turn!

351
00:12:13,801 --> 00:12:16,666
Well, there is an intensive
seminar camp.

352
00:12:16,701 --> 00:12:20,033
It's a bit severe, but it
might be the only way, m'kay.

353
00:12:20,068 --> 00:12:21,300
That sounds
good to me.

354
00:12:21,335 --> 00:12:22,799
Me too!

355
00:12:22,834 --> 00:12:23,632
Then it's settled.

356
00:12:23,667 --> 00:12:25,901
Boys, you're going
to tolerance camp!

357
00:12:25,936 --> 00:12:29,000
Tolerance camp?

358
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:36,732
<i>Velcome to tolerance camp.</i>

359
00:12:36,767 --> 00:12:40,634
You are here because you would
not accept people's differences.

360
00:12:40,669 --> 00:12:43,367
Because you refused to
accept the life choices

361
00:12:43,402 --> 00:12:44,232
Of your fellow man.

362
00:12:44,267 --> 00:12:46,032
Well, those days
are now over.

363
00:12:46,067 --> 00:12:49,732
<i>Here you will vork,
every hour of every day</i>

364
00:12:49,767 --> 00:12:53,133
Until you submit to being
tolerant of everybody.

365
00:12:53,168 --> 00:12:58,000
Here, intolerance...
will not be tolerated.

366
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:03,017
God dammit!

367
00:13:03,052 --> 00:13:04,599
How'd it go?

368
00:13:04,634 --> 00:13:06,365
This is unbelievable,
mr. Slave!

369
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:08,734
It seems no matter what i do
i can't get fired!

370
00:13:08,769 --> 00:13:10,868
The principal
didn't fire you?

371
00:13:10,903 --> 00:13:11,933
No!

372
00:13:11,968 --> 00:13:14,033
The parents felt so bad that
their kids didn't want to

373
00:13:14,068 --> 00:13:15,632
Attend my class anymore

374
00:13:15,667 --> 00:13:17,601
That they want to give me the
"courageous teacher" award

375
00:13:17,636 --> 00:13:19,601
This friday at the
museum of tolerance!

376
00:13:19,636 --> 00:13:21,532
Oh, jesus christ.

377
00:13:21,567 --> 00:13:23,232
I mean, i stuck
a gerbil up your ass

378
00:13:23,267 --> 00:13:25,584
And they want to give me
a goddamn medal!

379
00:13:25,619 --> 00:13:27,726
Well, it sounds to me
like the principal

380
00:13:27,761 --> 00:13:29,799
Is just hiding things
from everybody.

381
00:13:29,834 --> 00:13:32,334
What you need to do is
let the parents see

382
00:13:32,369 --> 00:13:34,635
What kind of demented
faggot you are.

383
00:13:34,670 --> 00:13:37,002
Oh, well- Hey,
that's right, mr. Slave.

384
00:13:37,037 --> 00:13:39,334
The parents have to
see for themselves.

385
00:13:41,367 --> 00:13:42,632
The award ceremony!

386
00:13:42,667 --> 00:13:44,868
We'll put on a show
they'll never forget!

387
00:13:44,903 --> 00:13:47,100
Ooh, jesus christ.

388
00:13:51,834 --> 00:13:55,501
* lemmiwinks journeyed
a distance far and fast *

389
00:13:55,536 --> 00:13:59,032
* to find his way out of
a gay man's ass *

390
00:13:59,067 --> 00:14:03,117
* the road ahead is filled
with danger and fright *

391
00:14:03,152 --> 00:14:07,167
* but push onward, lemmiwinks
with all of your might *

392
00:14:07,202 --> 00:14:08,632
Lemmiwinks!

393
00:14:08,667 --> 00:14:10,667
You are coming to the entrance
of the small intestine.

394
00:14:10,702 --> 00:14:12,032
There you must seek out
the sparrow prince.

395
00:14:12,067 --> 00:14:16,067
* the sparrow prince lies
somewhere way up ahead *

396
00:14:16,102 --> 00:14:20,485
* don't look back, lemmiwinks
or you'll soon be dead *

397
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:24,868
* lemmiwinks, lemmiwinks
the time is growing late *

398
00:14:24,903 --> 00:14:29,934
* slow down now
and seal your fate *

399
00:14:29,969 --> 00:14:31,165
I am the sparrow prince.

400
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:33,900
Long has my spirit been
trapped within this place.

401
00:14:33,935 --> 00:14:36,566
Before you lies the maze
of the small intestine.

402
00:14:36,601 --> 00:14:39,734
One path leads to the stomach,
the other to certain doom.

403
00:14:39,769 --> 00:14:42,000
Take with you
this helmet and torch.

404
00:14:42,035 --> 00:14:43,265
Let them be your guide.

405
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:46,866
* take the magic helmet torch
to help you light the way *

406
00:14:46,901 --> 00:14:50,434
* there's still a lot of ground
to cross inside the man so gay *

407
00:14:50,469 --> 00:14:52,299
* ahead of you
lies adventure *

408
00:14:52,334 --> 00:14:54,065
* and your strength
still lies within *

409
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:58,901
* freedom from the ass of doom
is the treasure you will win *

410
00:15:05,834 --> 00:15:09,032
<i>Today we will be using
ze finger paints.</i>

411
00:15:09,067 --> 00:15:12,868
<i>You vill make a painting that
shows people of different races</i>

412
00:15:12,903 --> 00:15:15,601
And sexual orientations
getting along.

413
00:15:15,636 --> 00:15:16,998
Finger paint.
Finger paint!

414
00:15:17,033 --> 00:15:20,234
You will not make any
distinction between

415
00:15:20,269 --> 00:15:21,866
People of different color,

416
00:15:21,901 --> 00:15:24,167
People with different
sexual preferences.

417
00:15:24,202 --> 00:15:26,165
You will accept
everyone!

418
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:28,100
What are you
finger painting?!

419
00:15:28,135 --> 00:15:29,418
Uh, a bear?

420
00:15:29,453 --> 00:15:30,666
<i>Ein bear?!</i>

421
00:15:30,701 --> 00:15:32,566
Ein bear has nothing
to do with

422
00:15:32,601 --> 00:15:33,917
Accepting people
of different races!

423
00:15:33,952 --> 00:15:35,234
I didn't know what
else to paint!

424
00:15:35,269 --> 00:15:37,432
Start over!

425
00:15:37,467 --> 00:15:38,234
<i>You vill finger paint
what we tell you!</i>

426
00:15:38,269 --> 00:15:39,784
Go!

427
00:15:39,819 --> 00:15:42,009
Faster.

428
00:15:42,044 --> 00:15:43,972
Faster!

429
00:15:44,007 --> 00:15:45,901
Fasterrrr!

430
00:15:45,936 --> 00:15:46,499
Ah!

431
00:15:46,534 --> 00:15:48,265
Faster!
Are you done?!

432
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:49,500
What is it?
What have you done?!

433
00:15:49,535 --> 00:15:50,934
People of all
colors and creeds

434
00:15:50,969 --> 00:15:52,334
Holding hands
beneath a rainbow!

435
00:15:52,369 --> 00:15:53,432
Good!

436
00:15:53,467 --> 00:15:55,067
That wasn't so hard,
was it?

437
00:15:55,102 --> 00:15:58,334
Now do it again!

438
00:15:58,369 --> 00:16:01,532
Faster!
Fasterrr!

439
00:16:01,567 --> 00:16:04,250
There, i've done it,
mr. Slave-

440
00:16:04,285 --> 00:16:06,899
The perfect plan
to get us fired!

441
00:16:06,934 --> 00:16:08,983
You finished your
costume design yet?

442
00:16:09,018 --> 00:16:11,033
Almost, i just have to
get through the-

443
00:16:11,068 --> 00:16:12,401
Oh- Jesus christ.

444
00:16:12,436 --> 00:16:13,699
What's the matter?

445
00:16:13,734 --> 00:16:15,100
Just a bit of
an upset stomach i guess.

446
00:16:15,135 --> 00:16:17,432
Well, here,
take a pepto pill.

447
00:16:17,467 --> 00:16:19,501
I can't have my teacher's
ass under the weather.

448
00:16:19,536 --> 00:16:21,667
Oh, jesus christ.

449
00:16:35,734 --> 00:16:38,965
* lemmiwinks came to
the stomach dark *

450
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:44,934
* 'neath the depths of
the lungs and heart *

451
00:16:44,969 --> 00:16:47,467
You chose your path
wisely, lemmiwinks.

452
00:16:47,502 --> 00:16:50,299
I am the catatafish.

453
00:16:50,334 --> 00:16:54,234
* catatafish of the
stomach's cove *

454
00:16:54,269 --> 00:16:56,199
If you answer
this riddle

455
00:16:56,234 --> 00:16:59,365
The esophagus
will let you pass.

456
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:05,100
* catatafish's riddle
will soon be told *

457
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:10,983
Everything in order?

458
00:17:11,018 --> 00:17:13,732
<i>Yes, mein fuhrer.</i>

459
00:17:13,767 --> 00:17:15,483
<i>Ve are making the prisoners
make macaroni pictures</i>

460
00:17:15,518 --> 00:17:17,200
<i>That illustrate diversity
in the vorkplace.</i>

461
00:17:17,235 --> 00:17:20,901
Excellent.

462
00:17:22,934 --> 00:17:24,000
Doh!

463
00:17:24,035 --> 00:17:25,032
Kyle!

464
00:17:25,067 --> 00:17:26,868
Kyle, you have to keep making
your macaroni pictures!

465
00:17:26,903 --> 00:17:29,200
Can't... glue...

466
00:17:29,235 --> 00:17:30,632
Anymore.

467
00:17:30,667 --> 00:17:32,100
The guards
are coming, kyle.

468
00:17:32,135 --> 00:17:32,998
Glue, glue damn you!

469
00:17:33,033 --> 00:17:35,234
<i>Take zis one away,
he is done for.</i>

470
00:17:35,269 --> 00:17:36,499
Butters?

471
00:17:36,534 --> 00:17:38,267
No more...
arts and crafts.

472
00:17:38,302 --> 00:17:40,265
Oh jesus.

473
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:43,299
We have to
get out of here.

474
00:17:43,334 --> 00:17:45,267
Please don't tell them
that we're hiding here!

475
00:17:45,302 --> 00:17:48,534
We can't work any more,
we'll die!

476
00:17:48,569 --> 00:17:49,834
What?! What?!

477
00:17:49,869 --> 00:17:51,065
Oh, uh, nothing!

478
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:52,133
I was just getting
back to work.

479
00:17:52,168 --> 00:17:53,234
What is in there?

480
00:17:53,269 --> 00:17:54,199
Nothing!

481
00:17:54,234 --> 00:17:55,234
Get back to work.

482
00:17:55,269 --> 00:17:56,901
Yes, sir!

483
00:17:56,936 --> 00:17:58,499
Phew...

484
00:17:58,534 --> 00:18:00,434
Heh-Heh, heh-Heh...

485
00:18:02,601 --> 00:18:05,599
Eww!
Ohh!

486
00:18:05,634 --> 00:18:06,833
Hey, i was just
kidding!

487
00:18:06,868 --> 00:18:08,934
There's actually two girls
hiding down there!

488
00:18:08,969 --> 00:18:10,132
Hey!

489
00:18:10,167 --> 00:18:14,334
Tonight, we are here to honor
an amazing 4th grade teacher

490
00:18:14,369 --> 00:18:17,899
With the
"courageous teacher" award.

491
00:18:17,934 --> 00:18:20,367
Herbert garrison came out
about two years ago.

492
00:18:20,402 --> 00:18:21,599
Since then, he has
faced adversity,

493
00:18:21,634 --> 00:18:24,634
He has even faced ridicule
by some of his students.

494
00:18:24,669 --> 00:18:26,833
Oh randy, i'm so
ashamed of our son.

495
00:18:26,868 --> 00:18:30,000
It is my honor to present the
courageous teacher award to-

496
00:18:30,035 --> 00:18:32,032
Herbert garrison.

497
00:18:32,067 --> 00:18:35,367
* dump de dump
de dumpity dump de dump *

498
00:18:35,402 --> 00:18:37,365
* dumpity dump

499
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:39,100
Get along,
little slave.

500
00:18:39,135 --> 00:18:40,466
Oh my god.

501
00:18:40,501 --> 00:18:42,367
<i>That's what our boys
were talking about?</i>

502
00:18:42,402 --> 00:18:44,301
Ding ding!
Ding ding!

503
00:18:44,336 --> 00:18:46,668
He is so
courageous.

504
00:18:46,703 --> 00:18:48,435
Say, mr. Slave...

505
00:18:48,470 --> 00:18:50,132
Yes, mr. Garrison?

506
00:18:50,167 --> 00:18:54,000
<i>I had a dream last night
that you were a real dick.</i>

507
00:18:54,035 --> 00:18:54,965
Really?

508
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,200
Why would you dream that
i was being an asshole?

509
00:18:56,235 --> 00:18:59,934
No, no-
I was the asshole.

510
00:18:59,969 --> 00:19:02,951
Oh, that is
so courageous.

511
00:19:02,986 --> 00:19:05,899
What an amazing
human being!

512
00:19:05,934 --> 00:19:09,234
Uh, i'm very happy
to get this award.

513
00:19:09,269 --> 00:19:12,534
But you know what
makes me even happier?

514
00:19:12,569 --> 00:19:14,300
Sucking balls.

515
00:19:14,335 --> 00:19:16,998
Ahhh...

516
00:19:17,033 --> 00:19:17,732
It isn't working!

517
00:19:17,767 --> 00:19:19,332
Sing your song,
mr. Slave!

518
00:19:19,367 --> 00:19:22,534
I've got a little-
Ooh! Oh, jesus christ.

519
00:19:22,569 --> 00:19:24,400
What's happening
in there?

520
00:19:24,435 --> 00:19:25,365
Hang on, lemmiwinks!

521
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:27,750
You solved the
catatafish's riddle!

522
00:19:27,785 --> 00:19:30,100
Now your trials are
nearly through!

523
00:19:30,135 --> 00:19:33,134
Oh, i should have
never shoved

524
00:19:33,169 --> 00:19:36,133
All those poor animals
up my ass!

525
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:40,732
Uh-

526
00:19:40,767 --> 00:19:42,766
Courageous.
So courageous!

527
00:19:42,801 --> 00:19:44,667
God dammit, don't you
people get it?!

528
00:19:44,702 --> 00:19:46,601
I'm trying to get
fired here!

529
00:19:46,636 --> 00:19:48,666
Oh, that's courageous.

530
00:19:48,701 --> 00:19:50,499
Look, this kind of behavior

531
00:19:50,534 --> 00:19:53,000
Should not be acceptable
from a teacher!

532
00:19:53,035 --> 00:19:55,098
Yeah, jesus christ.

533
00:19:55,133 --> 00:19:58,901
But the museum tells us
to be tolerant.

534
00:19:58,936 --> 00:20:00,965
Yes, the museum!

535
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,466
The museum tells us!

536
00:20:02,501 --> 00:20:04,399
Tolerant,
but not stupid!

537
00:20:04,434 --> 00:20:06,467
Look, just because you
have to tolerate something

538
00:20:06,502 --> 00:20:08,666
Doesn't mean you
have to approve of it!

539
00:20:08,701 --> 00:20:11,767
If you had to like it, it'd be
called the museum of acceptance.

540
00:20:11,802 --> 00:20:14,132
Tolerate means you're just
putting up with it.

541
00:20:14,167 --> 00:20:17,434
You tolerate a crying child
sitting next to you on the airplane,

542
00:20:17,469 --> 00:20:18,934
Or you tolerate
a bad cold.

543
00:20:18,969 --> 00:20:21,018
It can still
piss you off!

544
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:23,067
Jesus-Tap-Dancing-Christ!

545
00:20:23,102 --> 00:20:24,199
He's right.

546
00:20:24,234 --> 00:20:25,866
Our boys didn't
hate homosexuals,

547
00:20:25,901 --> 00:20:27,234
They just hated the way
this asshole was acting.

548
00:20:27,269 --> 00:20:30,200
We've gotta get
our boys back!

549
00:20:30,235 --> 00:20:31,599
Huh!

550
00:20:31,634 --> 00:20:34,934
So now can i please get fired
and get my $25 million?

551
00:20:34,969 --> 00:20:38,834
No, no, i think i have
a better idea.

552
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,133
We're sorry, boys,
why didn't you tell us

553
00:20:42,168 --> 00:20:44,232
Your teachers were acting
so over the top?

554
00:20:44,267 --> 00:20:46,467
Yes, you boys don't know
how much we've suffered!

555
00:20:48,234 --> 00:20:50,367
Come on, let's go.

556
00:20:50,402 --> 00:20:52,466
But this is insane!

557
00:20:52,501 --> 00:20:53,899
I'm sorry,
mr. Garrison,

558
00:20:53,934 --> 00:20:56,000
But it's obvious you aren't
tolerant of your own behavior.

559
00:20:56,035 --> 00:20:58,632
<i>Vhat do we have here,
new recruits?</i>

560
00:20:58,667 --> 00:21:00,534
<i>I assure you, the next veek
will be nothing</i>

561
00:21:00,569 --> 00:21:02,365
But pain and suffering!

562
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:05,100
Oooh, this could be
kind of fun.

563
00:21:05,135 --> 00:21:07,199
Ohh!

564
00:21:07,234 --> 00:21:11,067
* lemmiwinks has made it out
the tale is nearly through *

565
00:21:11,102 --> 00:21:12,766
Great job,
lemmiwinks!

566
00:21:12,801 --> 00:21:15,332
Thanks to you,
we are all free.

567
00:21:15,367 --> 00:21:17,467
But your adventures
are just beginning.

568
00:21:17,502 --> 00:21:19,567
For you are no ordinary
gerbil, lemmiwinks,

569
00:21:19,602 --> 00:21:23,151
You are-
The gerbil king.

570
00:21:23,186 --> 00:21:26,666
All hail the gerbil king!

571
00:21:26,701 --> 00:21:28,201
* now that you're
the gerbil king *

572
00:21:28,236 --> 00:21:29,666
* there's more
adventures to go on *

573
00:21:29,701 --> 00:21:33,399
* fly away to faraway lands
and to the setting sun *

574
00:21:33,434 --> 00:21:37,434
* there's still so many enemies
and battles yet to fight *

575
00:21:37,469 --> 00:21:39,300
* for lemmiwinks
the gerbil king *

576
00:21:39,335 --> 00:21:41,401

577

00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:55,165
