Hello, "chitty wok",

<i>Hello, is this

Yes, we'd like one
order of the city beef.

And i'll have

Chitty chicken.

Oh dude, look, it's that
commercial with the guy

23
00:00:59,069 --> 00:01:01,367
<i>Who lost 400 pounds eating
at subway sandwiches.</i>

* and he likes to
eat the sandwiches *

27
00:01:10,669 --> 00:01:11,868
Well,
hey, fellas.

28
00:01:11,903 --> 00:01:12,666
Hey, kenny.

29
00:01:12,701 --> 00:01:14,300
Now gosh darn it,
my name's not kenny.

30
00:01:14,335 --> 00:01:16,065
Kenny's dead,

31
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:18,033
And you're all gonna have to
learn to deal with that.

32
00:01:18,068 --> 00:01:19,284
Okay, not-Kenny.

33
00:01:19,319 --> 00:01:20,466
Hey south park!

34
00:01:20,501 --> 00:01:22,884
You can meet jared,
in person, march 6th,

35
00:01:22,919 --> 00:01:25,267
At the kenny mccormack
memorial town square.

36
00:01:25,302 --> 00:01:27,234
Oh boy, jared's
coming to town.

37
00:01:27,269 --> 00:01:28,566
Dude, that's today!

38
00:01:28,601 --> 00:01:29,968
We gotta get
down there.

39
00:01:30,003 --> 00:01:30,799
Come on,
not-Kenny.

40
00:01:30,834 --> 00:01:32,734
Now gosh darn it,
my name's not not-Kenny.

41
00:01:32,769 --> 00:01:34,467
Okay, come on,
not-Not-Kenny.

42
00:01:34,502 --> 00:01:37,065
I'm getting steamed now.

43
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:39,067
Ohh, chitty wok,

00:01:39,102 --> 00:01:40,634
I take order, please.

45
00:01:42,767 --> 00:01:44,766
Excuse me, can we
get through here?

46
00:01:44,801 --> 00:01:47,701
Hell no, i've been saving
this spot for six hours.

47
00:01:47,736 --> 00:01:49,985
* his name is garrison
mr. Garrison *

48
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:52,234
* he lost 10 pounds
taking jared's lead *

49
00:01:52,269 --> 00:01:54,199
Here he comes!

50
00:01:54,234 --> 00:01:58,534
* he's still looking good
with all those sandwiches *

51
00:02:02,167 --> 00:02:03,699
Thank you all so much.

52
00:02:03,734 --> 00:02:06,734
Y'know, after a year of eating
delicious sub sandwiches

53
00:02:06,769 --> 00:02:10,400
I've proven
weight loss is easy.

54
00:02:10,435 --> 00:02:11,799
And i promise you,

55
00:02:11,834 --> 00:02:14,901
I will always be your faithful
leader in easy weight loss.

56
00:02:14,936 --> 00:02:16,098
All right!

57
00:02:16,133 --> 00:02:19,033
That guy ate all the sandwiches
he wanted and lost weight.

58
00:02:19,068 --> 00:02:21,834
He is so cool.

59
00:02:22,601 --> 00:02:24,734
Mr. Fogle, some fans
wanted to see

60
00:02:24,769 --> 00:02:25,434
If you'd sign
their sandwich.

61
00:02:25,469 --> 00:02:27,334
Sure, let them in.

62
00:02:27,369 --> 00:02:28,834
Hi, kids.

63
00:02:28,869 --> 00:02:30,265
Wow, jared.

64
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:31,667
Dude, did you really
lose all that weight

65
00:02:31,702 --> 00:02:32,334
Eating nothing but
sub sandwiches?

66
00:02:32,369 --> 00:02:34,432
I sure did.

67
00:02:34,467 --> 00:02:37,100
Well, i also had a little
help on the side.

68
00:02:37,135 --> 00:02:38,165
What kind of help?

69
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:40,534
Well, eating sub sandwiches
was a big part of it.

70
00:02:40,569 --> 00:02:42,534
But the way that i lost
so much weight

71
00:02:42,569 --> 00:02:45,834
Was that i got aides.

72
00:02:45,869 --> 00:02:46,799
A- Aids?

73
00:02:46,834 --> 00:02:48,801
That's right, i got aides
about two years ago

74
00:02:48,836 --> 00:02:50,499
And i've been losing weight
ever since.

75
00:02:50,534 --> 00:02:52,968
It's amazing how slim
you can get with aides.

76
00:02:53,003 --> 00:02:53,666
I'll bet you can.

77
00:02:53,701 --> 00:02:55,467
Would you like to
meet them?

78
00:02:55,502 --> 00:02:56,666
Them?

79
00:02:56,701 --> 00:02:58,566
My aides.
Scott, tyler!

80
00:02:58,601 --> 00:03:01,567
Scott is my personal trainer
and tyler is my dietitian.

81
00:03:01,602 --> 00:03:02,599
Hello!Hello!

82
00:03:02,634 --> 00:03:04,684
Oh!
A- I-D-E-S, aides.

83
00:03:04,719 --> 00:03:06,699
Yeah, hooray
for aides!

84
00:03:06,734 --> 00:03:08,701
Well, that's not really what
you say in the commercial.

85
00:03:08,736 --> 00:03:10,300
I know, you kind of have to
read the fine print

86
00:03:10,335 --> 00:03:11,632
At the bottom
of the screen.

87
00:03:11,667 --> 00:03:13,000
It says i only ate a half-Size
lean turkey sandwich

88
00:03:13,035 --> 00:03:15,384
With no mustard or mayo
or anything like that.

89
00:03:15,419 --> 00:03:17,734
And then had proper
diet and exercise aides.

90
00:03:17,769 --> 00:03:18,933
But you're
lying to people.

91
00:03:18,968 --> 00:03:20,334
If they knew that
you didn't just

92
00:03:20,369 --> 00:03:21,651
Eat all the sandwiches
you want,

93
00:03:21,686 --> 00:03:22,899
You might not
be so popular.

94
00:03:22,934 --> 00:03:25,133
You think so?
Why should it matter?

95
00:03:25,168 --> 00:03:27,801
It matters, dude.

96
00:03:27,836 --> 00:03:28,998
Hmm.

97
00:03:29,033 --> 00:03:31,116
That penis-Butt didn't lose
weight eating sub sandwiches.

98
00:03:31,151 --> 00:03:32,859
He lost weight because he ate
less of them and exercised.

99
00:03:32,894 --> 00:03:34,567
Yeah, it's only in america
somebody can become famous

100
00:03:34,602 --> 00:03:36,534
Just because they go from
being a big fat-Ass

101
00:03:36,569 --> 00:03:37,367
To not being a big fat-Ass.

102
00:03:37,402 --> 00:03:39,632
Oh my god,
you guys-

103
00:03:39,667 --> 00:03:42,134
I think i'm having
a genius moment.

104
00:03:42,169 --> 00:03:44,601
Yes, yes,
it's coming to me now.

105
00:03:44,636 --> 00:03:45,933
Is that-
That's diarrhea.

106
00:03:45,968 --> 00:03:47,234
No- Don't you see
what this all means?

107
00:03:47,269 --> 00:03:49,666
Anybody could do
what he did.

108
00:03:49,701 --> 00:03:51,267
What's to stop someone else
from going to say, city wok,

109
00:03:51,302 --> 00:03:53,532
And cutting
a deal with them?

110
00:03:53,567 --> 00:03:55,132
Say they'll eat nothing
but their chinese food,

111
00:03:55,167 --> 00:03:57,567
But then eat only a little tiny
bit of it and exercise.

112
00:03:57,602 --> 00:03:59,968
Then city wok could say their
food makes you lose weight.

113
00:04:00,003 --> 00:04:03,367
That's right, stan,
it's a cash cow, i tell you.

114
00:04:03,402 --> 00:04:04,599
That's a great idea!

115
00:04:04,634 --> 00:04:05,833
Lose weight
and make money.

116
00:04:05,868 --> 00:04:07,267
I tell you, this is gonna
be the greatest thing

117
00:04:07,302 --> 00:04:09,067
That butters
has ever done.

118
00:04:09,102 --> 00:04:10,032
Me?

119
00:04:10,067 --> 00:04:11,467
Who do you think i'm
talking about, butters,

120
00:04:11,502 --> 00:04:12,466
Joyce dewitt?

121
00:04:12,501 --> 00:04:13,968
Oh, no, i thought
you meant you.

122
00:04:14,003 --> 00:04:14,632
You're the fat one.

123
00:04:14,667 --> 00:04:15,666
I can't lose
weight, butters,

124
00:04:15,701 --> 00:04:17,484
Because i'm not fat,
i'm big boned.

125
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:19,267
You can't slim down
bones, stupid.

126
00:04:19,302 --> 00:04:20,401
But butters
isn't fat.

127
00:04:20,436 --> 00:04:21,868
That's my
whole point.

128
00:04:21,903 --> 00:04:23,265
First, we fatten him up.

129
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:24,801
Then we make the deal
with city wok.

130
00:04:24,836 --> 00:04:26,432
Then, take the weight
back off.

131
00:04:26,467 --> 00:04:28,200
He's right- If butters
is naturally skinny,

132
00:04:28,235 --> 00:04:29,934
He'll be able to take
the weight off faster.

133
00:04:29,969 --> 00:04:30,766
But fellas,

134
00:04:30,801 --> 00:04:32,132
If i get fat my parents
will ground me.

135
00:04:32,167 --> 00:04:33,234
Oh, come on, just think about
how famous you'll be.

136
00:04:33,269 --> 00:04:34,965
You mean like jared?

137
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,534
Sure, dude, you'll
be just like jared.

138
00:04:36,569 --> 00:04:37,666
Well,
the heck with that,

139
00:04:37,701 --> 00:04:38,766
You said jared
was a penis-Butt.

140
00:04:38,801 --> 00:04:39,434
You wouldn't be
a penis-Butt, butters,

141
00:04:39,469 --> 00:04:41,632
You'd be famous.

142
00:04:41,667 --> 00:04:43,284
Just think about all those
people following you around,

143
00:04:43,319 --> 00:04:44,901
Singing songs to you just
'cause you lost some weight.

144
00:04:44,936 --> 00:04:46,468
* his name is butters
it's butters *

145
00:04:46,503 --> 00:04:47,965
* used to be fat
but not no more *

146
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,417
* city wok brought him down
to a size four *

147
00:04:50,452 --> 00:04:53,160
* now he's got lots of
moneys and girls *

148
00:04:53,195 --> 00:04:55,868
* and a lifetime of
free food at city wok *

149
00:04:55,903 --> 00:04:57,866
Wow.

150
00:04:57,901 --> 00:05:00,434
Christine, you know
i love you very much

151
00:05:00,469 --> 00:05:02,400
And i can't wait
for the wedding.

152
00:05:02,435 --> 00:05:03,632
I love you too, jared.

153
00:05:03,667 --> 00:05:04,899
You changed
my whole life.

154
00:05:04,934 --> 00:05:06,365
* her name is donez
christine donez *

155
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,267
* she lost 40 pounds when
she met jared and- *

156
00:05:08,302 --> 00:05:10,466
I know, i know.

157
00:05:10,501 --> 00:05:12,199
But, ah, some young boys
were talking to me earlier

158
00:05:12,234 --> 00:05:14,868
And they made me think that
people might not be so proud

159
00:05:14,903 --> 00:05:17,234
Of my weight loss
if they knew something.

160
00:05:17,269 --> 00:05:19,032
Jared, what's this
all about?

161
00:05:19,067 --> 00:05:21,901
Christine, this probably isn't
gonna matter to you at all,

162
00:05:21,936 --> 00:05:23,734
But i have aides.

163
00:05:23,769 --> 00:05:24,866
What?

164
00:05:24,901 --> 00:05:25,799
Yeah, i have aides.

165
00:05:25,834 --> 00:05:28,950
I've had aides since
before we were together.

166
00:05:28,985 --> 00:05:32,067
What, what are you thinking,
are you bummed?

167
00:05:32,102 --> 00:05:33,532
Am i bummed?

168
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:35,667
You've had aids all this time
and you knew it?

169
00:05:35,702 --> 00:05:36,666
Well, of course
i knew it.

170
00:05:36,701 --> 00:05:38,332
Why the hell
wouldn't you tell me?

171
00:05:38,367 --> 00:05:39,801
I didn't think it was
that big of a deal.

172
00:05:39,836 --> 00:05:41,267
Not that big
of a deal?!

173
00:05:41,302 --> 00:05:42,532
I slept with you!

174
00:05:42,567 --> 00:05:43,833
Aren't you overreacting
a little bit?

175
00:05:43,868 --> 00:05:45,734
But jesus christ, we're
supposed to get married.

176
00:05:45,769 --> 00:05:47,101
We can still
get married, christine.

177
00:05:47,136 --> 00:05:48,399
<i>I mean, sure,
they're my aides now,</i>

178
00:05:48,434 --> 00:05:51,400
But after we get married,
they'll be our aides.

179
00:05:52,701 --> 00:05:53,968
You'll love having aides,
christine, you really will.

180
00:05:54,003 --> 00:05:56,801
And when we have children,
they'll have aides.

181
00:05:56,836 --> 00:05:58,300
It will make things
so simple.

182
00:05:59,534 --> 00:06:00,399
Christine!

183
00:06:00,434 --> 00:06:02,701
Jeez, those boys
were right.

184
00:06:02,736 --> 00:06:04,651
People really don't
like aides.

185
00:06:04,686 --> 00:06:06,567
I better tell everyone
the truth.

186
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:09,199
Hello there,
children.

187
00:06:09,234 --> 00:06:11,467
Chef, we need butters to
gain about 50 pounds, fast.

188
00:06:11,502 --> 00:06:13,118
50 pounds, why?

189
00:06:13,153 --> 00:06:14,699
Ah, school project.

190
00:06:14,734 --> 00:06:16,968
Well, if you want him to get
really fat as fast as possible,

191
00:06:17,003 --> 00:06:19,167
One of you will
have to marry him.

192
00:06:19,202 --> 00:06:21,032
Marry him?

193
00:06:21,067 --> 00:06:23,234
It definitely worked for
every woman i ever met.

194
00:06:23,269 --> 00:06:25,734
Oh, no no no-
I ain't getting married,

195
00:06:25,769 --> 00:06:26,799
My parents will ground me.

196
00:06:26,834 --> 00:06:28,634
Yeah, none of us
want to marry butters.

197
00:06:28,669 --> 00:06:30,232
How come,
what's wrong with me?

198
00:06:30,267 --> 00:06:32,400
Well, i guess we oughtta
do this the old fashion way.

199
00:06:32,435 --> 00:06:34,634
Come on back, children.

200
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:39,267
I can't eat no more.

201
00:06:39,302 --> 00:06:40,466
You have to.

202
00:06:40,501 --> 00:06:42,033
Here, have some more
mayonnaise.

203
00:06:42,634 --> 00:06:43,934
Chef, we need
more food.

204
00:06:43,969 --> 00:06:45,534
I'm running out,
children.

205
00:06:45,569 --> 00:06:47,065
Damn it, butters,
keep eating

206
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:50,400
Or else i'll kick your ass 'til
you're deader than kenny!

207
00:06:50,435 --> 00:06:51,566
Dude, that isn't cool.

208
00:06:51,601 --> 00:06:53,100
You shouldn't joke about
kenny being dead.

209
00:06:53,135 --> 00:06:53,998
Enough time hasn't passed.

210
00:06:54,033 --> 00:06:55,300
So how long until
we can joke about it?

211
00:06:55,335 --> 00:06:56,632
22.3 years.

212
00:06:56,667 --> 00:06:58,367
That's how long it takes for
something tragic to be funny.

213
00:06:58,402 --> 00:06:59,334
That's a long time
to wait.

214
00:06:59,369 --> 00:07:01,599
I can't eat no more.

215
00:07:01,634 --> 00:07:03,934
I just keep
puking it up.

216
00:07:03,969 --> 00:07:04,234
Then eat your puke.

217
00:07:04,269 --> 00:07:06,299
No!

218
00:07:06,334 --> 00:07:08,634
Oh, come on,
japanese girls do it.

219
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:12,033
Ladies and gentlemen, we at
subway are happy to inform you

220
00:07:12,068 --> 00:07:15,801
That jared has elected
to stay in south park

221
00:07:15,836 --> 00:07:18,535
In order to speak to you
once again!

222
00:07:18,570 --> 00:07:21,234
He's going to speak
to us once again.

223
00:07:21,269 --> 00:07:23,618
So here he is...
jared!

224
00:07:23,653 --> 00:07:25,933
* he's still looking good *

225
00:07:25,968 --> 00:07:30,400
* eating them sandwiches
all the time *

226
00:07:30,435 --> 00:07:32,032
Thank you,
thank you all.

227
00:07:32,067 --> 00:07:36,300
Subway is a healthy way to eat
fast food and lose weight!

228
00:07:36,335 --> 00:07:37,699
All right!

229
00:07:37,734 --> 00:07:39,666
But, i feel like
i need to

230
00:07:39,701 --> 00:07:41,699
Come a little clean
about something.

231
00:07:41,734 --> 00:07:45,367
<i>It wasn't just subway sandwiches
that made me thin.</i>

232
00:07:45,402 --> 00:07:47,399
Huh?

233
00:07:47,434 --> 00:07:50,334
The reason why i was able to
lose so much weight, so quickly,

234
00:07:50,369 --> 00:07:53,318
Was that i got aides.

235
00:07:53,353 --> 00:07:56,232
Did he say aids?

236
00:07:56,267 --> 00:07:58,234
But i still want to be the
leader in a thinner america,

237
00:07:58,269 --> 00:07:59,632
And so i'm here to tell you

238
00:07:59,667 --> 00:08:02,400
That you should all go out
and get aides!

239
00:08:02,435 --> 00:08:03,466
Oh my god.

240
00:08:03,501 --> 00:08:04,766
Is he serious?

241
00:08:04,801 --> 00:08:06,065
Having aides
is awesome!

242
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:09,283
With aides you can literally
watch the fat melt away.

243
00:08:09,318 --> 00:08:12,467
And with the proper mix of
aides and subway sandwiches

244
00:08:12,502 --> 00:08:14,699
Anything is possible.

245
00:08:14,734 --> 00:08:16,998
Ah, the opinions
expressed by mr. Fogle

246
00:08:17,033 --> 00:08:19,868
Are not necessarily those
of the subway company.

247
00:08:23,367 --> 00:08:26,299
Wow!
He looks great.

248
00:08:26,334 --> 00:08:27,300
How do you feel,
butters?

249
00:08:27,335 --> 00:08:28,267
Well, kind of
like cartman.

250
00:08:28,302 --> 00:08:29,299
Ow!

251
00:08:29,334 --> 00:08:31,332
Get a hold of
yourself, man.

252
00:08:31,367 --> 00:08:33,534
All right, now it's
time for phase two.

253
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:36,632
Welcome to chitty wok.

254
00:08:36,667 --> 00:08:38,767
Would you like to try
chitty chicken today?

255
00:08:38,802 --> 00:08:40,151
Sir, we have come
to offer you

256
00:08:40,186 --> 00:08:41,501
The business deal
of a lifetime.

257
00:08:41,536 --> 00:08:43,799
You want the
chitty beef?

258
00:08:43,834 --> 00:08:45,000
No, we want to show the world
how healthy your food is.

259
00:08:45,035 --> 00:08:48,067
Our fat friend here is
going to lose 40 pounds

260
00:08:48,102 --> 00:08:48,998
Eating at chitty wok.

261
00:08:49,033 --> 00:08:51,033
Which one?
I see two fat friend.

262
00:08:51,068 --> 00:08:52,332
The fat one.

263
00:08:52,367 --> 00:08:53,833
We're gonna take
before-And-After photos.

264
00:08:53,868 --> 00:08:55,334
And then when he gets skinny
from eating your food

265
00:08:55,369 --> 00:08:56,801
We'll show the world.

266
00:08:56,836 --> 00:08:58,599
Why?

267
00:08:58,634 --> 00:08:59,632
Because then
you can pay us

268
00:08:59,667 --> 00:09:01,567
To use our friend
in commercials.

269
00:09:01,602 --> 00:09:03,567
Oh, you mean
like jared?

270
00:09:03,602 --> 00:09:04,699
Just like jared.

271
00:09:04,734 --> 00:09:06,868
* his name is jared
he lose some weight *

272
00:09:06,903 --> 00:09:09,300
* chitty wok food
sure is great *

273
00:09:09,335 --> 00:09:10,699
Yeah, okay,
that sound good.

274
00:09:10,734 --> 00:09:12,567
So if he lose weight
eating chitty wok

275
00:09:12,602 --> 00:09:14,400
I pay you to use him
in commercial.

276
00:09:14,435 --> 00:09:16,468
All right!
All right!

277
00:09:16,503 --> 00:09:18,501
Sir, we are
in business.

278
00:09:18,536 --> 00:09:19,766
Jared, first of all

279
00:09:19,801 --> 00:09:21,599
We want to say that
all of us here at subway

280
00:09:21,634 --> 00:09:23,784
Appreciate everything
you've done for our company.

281
00:09:23,819 --> 00:09:25,934
Well, i appreciate your
company doing everything

282
00:09:25,969 --> 00:09:26,632
It's done for me.

283
00:09:26,667 --> 00:09:28,065
Yes, well, it is
now the opinion

284
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:31,234
Of all of us that perhaps
it would be best for you

285
00:09:31,269 --> 00:09:32,766
To take your...

286
00:09:32,801 --> 00:09:36,234
<i>Strange theories
on weight loss elsewhere.</i>

287
00:09:36,269 --> 00:09:40,065
Excuse me...
am i being fired?

288
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:43,601
Jared, it's just that your
new take on weight loss

289
00:09:43,636 --> 00:09:46,167
Is contrary to our
commitment to good health.

290
00:09:46,202 --> 00:09:47,299
How so?

291
00:09:47,334 --> 00:09:49,400
Well, your new slogan
for instance.

292
00:09:49,435 --> 00:09:51,666
"When it comes to fitness

293
00:09:51,701 --> 00:09:54,300
Subway goes hand in hand
with aides."

294
00:09:54,335 --> 00:09:56,801
Uh-Huh.

295
00:09:59,133 --> 00:10:03,133
* his name is jared
he's jared, lost weight *

296
00:10:03,168 --> 00:10:05,165
* eating subway

297
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:07,317
* now he's
cold and alone *

298
00:10:07,352 --> 00:10:09,399
* no one to
call his home *

299
00:10:09,434 --> 00:10:11,234
* he likes sandwiches
in philadelphia *

300
00:10:11,269 --> 00:10:13,998
* with cream cheese *

301
00:10:14,033 --> 00:10:16,667
Come on, butters you gotta
get skinny again!

302
00:10:16,702 --> 00:10:18,300
You are such a flabby
hunk of crap!

303
00:10:18,335 --> 00:10:20,118
Look at those
jelly rolls.

304
00:10:20,153 --> 00:10:21,866
Jelly rolls,
i tell ya!

305
00:10:21,901 --> 00:10:23,499
You still got
seven chins, boy!

306
00:10:23,534 --> 00:10:25,501
You'll never be thin.
Nobody loves you!

307
00:10:25,536 --> 00:10:26,532
Hey now, they do, too.

308
00:10:26,567 --> 00:10:29,167
My mom and dad love me
even if i am fat.

309
00:10:29,202 --> 00:10:30,467
Butters, i'm just
trying to offer

310
00:10:30,502 --> 00:10:31,901
Some motivational
help here.

311
00:10:31,936 --> 00:10:33,032
All right then.

312
00:10:33,067 --> 00:10:33,732
Row, you fat bitch!

313
00:10:33,767 --> 00:10:35,334
Look at them
jelly rolls!

314
00:10:35,369 --> 00:10:36,432
Nobody loves you!

315
00:10:36,467 --> 00:10:38,534
You're not even
a person!

316
00:10:38,569 --> 00:10:40,601
I never asked
to be famous.

317
00:10:40,636 --> 00:10:41,965
Now everyone hates me.

318
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,434
I almost wish i'd never
gotten aides!

319
00:10:44,469 --> 00:10:45,732
Hey, now come on.

320
00:10:45,767 --> 00:10:47,400
What kind of
talk is that?

321
00:10:47,435 --> 00:10:48,766
I'm sorry, guys,

322
00:10:48,801 --> 00:10:51,200
But i think i want to be
aides-Free for a while.

323
00:10:51,235 --> 00:10:52,634
Come on, jared,
lighten up.

324
00:10:52,669 --> 00:10:53,599
People don't hate you.

325
00:10:53,634 --> 00:10:55,399
Yeah, maybe they're
all just jealous

326
00:10:55,434 --> 00:10:57,534
That they can't afford to
hire their own aides.

327
00:10:57,569 --> 00:11:00,300
Wait a minute,
you're right.

328
00:11:00,335 --> 00:11:01,766
Yeah!

329
00:11:01,801 --> 00:11:04,300
I think i know how to be
a celebrity again.

330
00:11:04,335 --> 00:11:06,334
Did you bring
the camera?

331
00:11:06,369 --> 00:11:07,833
Yeah, we're all set.

332
00:11:07,868 --> 00:11:09,300
Guys, i think this might be a
good time to discuss business.

333
00:11:09,335 --> 00:11:11,098
What do you mean?

334
00:11:11,133 --> 00:11:12,666
Well, when city wok sees
how skinny butters is

335
00:11:12,701 --> 00:11:14,667
They're not gonna want him
to just make one commercial,

336
00:11:14,702 --> 00:11:15,998
They're gonna
want several.

337
00:11:16,033 --> 00:11:17,300
That's true, jared did like
100 for subway sandwiches.

338
00:11:17,335 --> 00:11:19,434
I think we're looking at
a nonexclusive

339
00:11:19,469 --> 00:11:20,599
Two-Year, 50-Picture
deal here.

340
00:11:20,634 --> 00:11:23,133
My calculations put that at
about $4 million.

341
00:11:23,168 --> 00:11:24,265
Wow!

342
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:26,132
Now, i think
the four million

343
00:11:26,167 --> 00:11:28,100
Should be split evenly
among the three of us.

344
00:11:28,135 --> 00:11:30,117
Except that i should get
a 20% per negation fee

345
00:11:30,152 --> 00:11:32,100
Off the gross for having
come up with the idea.

346
00:11:32,135 --> 00:11:32,866
Hey, fellas.

347
00:11:32,901 --> 00:11:33,667
Butters, what the hell
are you doing?!

348
00:11:33,702 --> 00:11:35,132
Yeah, you're still fat!

349
00:11:35,167 --> 00:11:36,365
I know, i can't
seem to lose it.

350
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:38,367
But we're supposed to shoot your
commercial for city wok today,

351
00:11:38,402 --> 00:11:39,699
You fat piece of crap!

352
00:11:39,734 --> 00:11:41,566
Well, i don't know
what to tell you.

353
00:11:41,601 --> 00:11:42,601
Losing weight is harder
than putting it on.

354
00:11:42,636 --> 00:11:44,098
No, it isn't,
stupid blubber butt!

355
00:11:44,133 --> 00:11:47,100
Did you eat only one ounce
of city wok a day

356
00:11:47,135 --> 00:11:47,833
Like we told you?

357
00:11:47,868 --> 00:11:49,884
Well, yeah, but
i don't know.

358
00:11:49,919 --> 00:11:51,866
Why are you
doing this to us?

359
00:11:51,901 --> 00:11:54,133
All prepared for
liposuction surgery.

360
00:11:54,168 --> 00:11:55,265
Check.

361
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:56,617
I don't know
about this, fellas.

362
00:11:56,652 --> 00:11:57,934
Hey, you're the one
that screwed us

363
00:11:57,969 --> 00:11:59,299
By not losing weight,
butters.

364
00:11:59,334 --> 00:12:01,067
Okay, it says here
the operation begins

365
00:12:01,102 --> 00:12:03,134
With a one-Inch incision
in the abdomen

366
00:12:03,169 --> 00:12:05,167
On the left side
just above the hip.

367
00:12:05,202 --> 00:12:07,400
<i>So that's,
right about here.</i>

368
00:12:07,435 --> 00:12:08,599
Whoa!

369
00:12:08,634 --> 00:12:09,732
Stop your bitching,
butters!

370
00:12:09,767 --> 00:12:10,734
God, kenny would've
took it like a man!

371
00:12:10,769 --> 00:12:12,468
Okay now, put
one end of the tube

372
00:12:12,503 --> 00:12:14,167
A half an inch
into the incision.

373
00:12:14,202 --> 00:12:15,566
Alrighty.

374
00:12:15,601 --> 00:12:17,534
Whoa, i think this is
a bad idea, fellas.

375
00:12:17,569 --> 00:12:18,635
I feel woozy.

376
00:12:18,670 --> 00:12:19,666
I think it's in.

377
00:12:19,701 --> 00:12:21,417
The liposuction
is a process

378
00:12:21,452 --> 00:12:23,133
Of siphoning out
the excess fat.

379
00:12:30,434 --> 00:12:31,232
There it goes.

380
00:12:31,267 --> 00:12:33,199
All right,
it's working.

381
00:12:33,234 --> 00:12:36,067
Oh man, it taste like that
creamed chip beef stuff

382
00:12:36,102 --> 00:12:37,265
That chef makes sometimes.

383
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:39,098
Uh, fellas, i don't
feel very good.

384
00:12:39,133 --> 00:12:40,868
Shut up, butters, this is
your own damn fault.

385
00:12:40,903 --> 00:12:42,685
Everything's
getting dark.

386
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,432
We gotta
hurry this up.

387
00:12:44,467 --> 00:12:46,467
Yeah, keep doing that,
that's working good.

388
00:12:46,502 --> 00:12:47,901
He's losing weight.

389
00:12:47,936 --> 00:12:48,399
Whoa, whoa!

390
00:12:48,434 --> 00:12:50,399
He's out of control!

391
00:12:50,434 --> 00:12:52,699
Everything's
getting sparkly.

392
00:12:52,734 --> 00:12:54,300
Oh no, dude, butters'
parents are home.

393
00:12:54,335 --> 00:12:56,201
Oh crap!

394
00:12:56,236 --> 00:12:58,032
Dude, bail!

395
00:12:58,067 --> 00:12:59,834
Butters?
Butters!

396
00:12:59,869 --> 00:13:01,065
Mom, dad.

397
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:04,033
Butters, are you having
liposuction surgery?

398
00:13:04,068 --> 00:13:05,133
Tell me the truth.

399
00:13:05,168 --> 00:13:06,232
Yes, sir.

400
00:13:06,267 --> 00:13:07,566
This is
unbelievable!

401
00:13:07,601 --> 00:13:09,267
How many times have we
told you never to have

402
00:13:09,302 --> 00:13:10,934
Self-Performed liposuction
surgery in our house?

403
00:13:10,969 --> 00:13:11,666
Four times, mom.

404
00:13:11,701 --> 00:13:13,499
Well, i guess
that wasn't enough.

405
00:13:13,534 --> 00:13:15,367
You get up to your room
right now, mister.

406
00:13:15,402 --> 00:13:17,133
Yes, sir.

407
00:13:19,767 --> 00:13:22,300
Oh, don't you give us
that look, young man,

408
00:13:22,335 --> 00:13:24,467
You're gonna get it!

409
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:26,998
Tom, i'm standing out front of
the mayor's office

410
00:13:27,033 --> 00:13:30,016
Where the big liar, jared is
once again about to speak.

411
00:13:30,051 --> 00:13:33,000
Apparently, jared hopes to
regain his celebrity hero status

412
00:13:33,035 --> 00:13:36,217
Which was lost when he
announced that it was aids,

413
00:13:36,252 --> 00:13:39,400
Not sub sandwiches, that
caused him to lose weight.

414
00:13:39,435 --> 00:13:40,666
Let's listen in.

415
00:13:40,701 --> 00:13:42,834
Ladies and gentlemen,
at first i didn't understand

416
00:13:42,869 --> 00:13:44,599
Why you felt betrayed
by the fact

417
00:13:44,634 --> 00:13:46,666
That my aides helped me
to lose weight.

418
00:13:46,701 --> 00:13:48,868
But now i understand that
it's because isn't fair

419
00:13:48,903 --> 00:13:51,532
That i had aides
and most of you don't.

420
00:13:51,567 --> 00:13:54,167
And so, with all the money
i made from commercials

421
00:13:54,202 --> 00:13:55,998
I've decided to start

422
00:13:56,033 --> 00:13:59,901
The "aides for everyone
foundation".

423
00:13:59,936 --> 00:14:01,265
What?!

424
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:03,499
I am going to
personally see to it

425
00:14:03,534 --> 00:14:08,300
That each and every
one of you gets aides.

426
00:14:08,335 --> 00:14:10,165
This guy's insane.

427
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:11,632
But i won't stop there.

428
00:14:11,667 --> 00:14:12,968
I'm gonna seek out
all the underprivileged

429
00:14:13,003 --> 00:14:15,799
And hungry children
of the world,

430
00:14:15,834 --> 00:14:19,234
And i'm going to
give them aides myself!

431
00:14:19,269 --> 00:14:21,065
You're gonna give
children aids?

432
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:24,067
Yes, it is my hope that every
beautiful child on this earth

433
00:14:24,102 --> 00:14:25,851
Has aides by next month.

434
00:14:25,886 --> 00:14:27,601
Aides for everyone!

435
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,334
Get him!

436
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:37,968
Come on, butters,
time to go.

437
00:14:38,003 --> 00:14:38,965
Go where?

438
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,567
To city wok, so we can
make our money- God!

439
00:14:40,602 --> 00:14:41,833
I can't go
anywhere, fellas.

440
00:14:41,868 --> 00:14:43,133
I've been grounded for having
liposuction surgery.

441
00:14:43,168 --> 00:14:45,265
What?

442
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:46,699
I told you my parents
would be sore.

443
00:14:46,734 --> 00:14:48,534
And they said for having
liposuction surgery

444
00:14:48,569 --> 00:14:50,632
I can't be outside
for five days.

445
00:14:50,667 --> 00:14:52,467
Dude, we just need you to come
down to city wok real quick

446
00:14:52,502 --> 00:14:53,699
So they can see
how skinny you are.

447
00:14:53,734 --> 00:14:56,098
You guys already got me
in dutch for being fat.

448
00:14:56,133 --> 00:14:58,033
And then i got in double dutch
for having liposuction.

449
00:14:58,068 --> 00:15:00,934
And now you're asking me
to be in triple dutch?

450
00:15:00,969 --> 00:15:02,901
Unh-Uh, i'll never be
that dutch.

451
00:15:02,936 --> 00:15:05,000
Kenny would've
done it.

452
00:15:05,035 --> 00:15:05,998
Yup.

453
00:15:06,033 --> 00:15:07,968
You guys remember what a
cool friend kenny was?

454
00:15:08,003 --> 00:15:10,200
God, he was always up
for helping us out.

455
00:15:10,235 --> 00:15:11,100
Man, he was the
best friend ever.

456
00:15:11,135 --> 00:15:13,332
Look, fellas,
i can't do it.

457
00:15:13,367 --> 00:15:15,400
My mom and dad call in
every hour from work

458
00:15:15,435 --> 00:15:16,833
To make sure i'm here.

459
00:15:16,868 --> 00:15:20,000
If i don't answer the phone
they'll know i'm up to no good.

460
00:15:20,035 --> 00:15:21,032
All right,
all right.

461
00:15:21,067 --> 00:15:22,334
I'll stay here and answer
the phone for you.

462
00:15:22,369 --> 00:15:23,684
But you don't
sound like me.

463
00:15:23,719 --> 00:15:24,965
"But you don't
sound like me.

464
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,650
"My name is butters,
and i'm a little pussy

465
00:15:26,685 --> 00:15:28,300
Who won't help his
friends make money."

466
00:15:28,335 --> 00:15:30,299
Wow, that was
pretty good.

467
00:15:30,334 --> 00:15:31,799
All right, it's settled,
come on, butters.

468
00:15:31,834 --> 00:15:34,167
Don't forget, a third of that
$4 million is mine.

469
00:15:44,501 --> 00:15:46,265
Well, hello.

470
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:47,133
I'm just checking in
on you, butters.

471
00:15:47,168 --> 00:15:49,532
Do i hear the television?

472
00:15:49,567 --> 00:15:51,400
We told you, no television
while you're grounded.

473
00:15:51,435 --> 00:15:53,234
Oh, gee whiz, i'm not
watching television, dad.

474
00:15:53,269 --> 00:15:55,634
I'm just laying around
jacking it.

475
00:15:55,669 --> 00:15:57,032
Jacking it?
Jacking what?

476
00:15:57,067 --> 00:15:59,032
Well, my hot spicy boner,
of course, dad.

477
00:15:59,067 --> 00:16:01,200
What?! Are you trying to get
yourself in more trouble

478
00:16:01,235 --> 00:16:02,499
With that kind of
language?

479
00:16:02,534 --> 00:16:04,484
Loosen up, you bloody
vaginal belch.

480
00:16:04,519 --> 00:16:05,909
Oh, you are gonna
get it, mister.

481
00:16:05,944 --> 00:16:07,300
You just wait
until i get home!

482
00:16:07,335 --> 00:16:10,000
Bring it on,
queer bait.

483
00:16:10,035 --> 00:16:11,032
Yes.

484
00:16:11,067 --> 00:16:14,699
I tell my girlfriend i have
aides and she leaves.

485
00:16:14,734 --> 00:16:17,617
I tell the world to get aides
and they think i'm crazy.

486
00:16:17,652 --> 00:16:20,501
I offer to give aides to kids
and everyone wants me dead.

487
00:16:20,536 --> 00:16:22,566
What's wrong with aides?

488
00:16:22,601 --> 00:16:26,267
Why doesn't anyone want me
to give them aides?

489
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:30,801
There he is, beating
that dead horse.

490
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:34,399
Aah!

491
00:16:34,434 --> 00:16:37,067
Welcome to chitty wok.
Take your order, please.

492
00:16:37,102 --> 00:16:38,165
We have great news.

493
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:40,467
Our friend lost 40 pounds

494
00:16:40,502 --> 00:16:42,468

That's right.

497
00:16:45,701 --> 00:16:46,968
So now you can pay us to
use him in your commercials

498
00:16:47,003 --> 00:16:48,400
And you'll have your
very own jared.

499
00:16:48,435 --> 00:16:49,799
Oh, no, no way.

500
00:16:49,834 --> 00:16:52,400
I'm not putting no jared
in my chitty wok commercial.

501
00:16:52,435 --> 00:16:53,666
Why not?

502
00:16:53,701 --> 00:16:55,499
Don't you know?
Everybody hate jared.

503
00:16:55,534 --> 00:16:57,467
He want everyone in the world
to have aids.

504
00:16:57,502 --> 00:16:59,200
He sick in the head.

505
00:16:59,235 --> 00:17:00,199
What?

506
00:17:00,234 --> 00:17:01,801
I don't want chitty wok
to have nothing to do

507
00:17:01,836 --> 00:17:02,699
With jared
and his aids.

508
00:17:02,734 --> 00:17:04,434
Wait, everyone
hates jared now?

509
00:17:04,469 --> 00:17:05,833
Yeah, they
gonna kill him.

510
00:17:05,868 --> 00:17:08,301
They're gonna kill jared
downtown right now.

511
00:17:08,336 --> 00:17:10,734
Ah! Come on, guys,
we gotta sort this out.

512
00:17:10,769 --> 00:17:12,167
Here's some
anthrax for ya!

513
00:17:13,901 --> 00:17:15,234
Heh-Heh, heh-Heh.

514
00:17:16,567 --> 00:17:18,267
Anthrax is giving me
colon cancer.

515
00:17:18,302 --> 00:17:20,599
Hello.

516
00:17:20,634 --> 00:17:21,866
Butters,
your father called

517
00:17:21,901 --> 00:17:23,666
And said you
made him very upset.

518
00:17:23,701 --> 00:17:25,833
Yeah, well, dad's being
a little pussy, mom.

519
00:17:25,868 --> 00:17:28,667
Butters, where did you get
that kind of smart mouth?

520
00:17:28,702 --> 00:17:30,484
Not from you dumb-Asses,
that's for sure.

521
00:17:30,519 --> 00:17:32,267
Oh, you just wait until
i get home, mister!

522
00:17:32,302 --> 00:17:34,284
I'll be waiting
with bells on,

523
00:17:34,319 --> 00:17:36,232
You old
horse-Banging skank.

524
00:17:36,267 --> 00:17:40,133
Hey, that's some
anthrax over there!

525
00:17:46,934 --> 00:17:49,667
Why did i ever do those
stupid commercials?

526
00:17:49,702 --> 00:17:51,365
All right, jared,
you sick pervert,

527
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:53,367
Do you have anything to say
before you die?

528
00:17:53,402 --> 00:17:55,132
Wait!

529
00:17:55,167 --> 00:17:56,434
You're all making
a mistake!

530
00:17:56,469 --> 00:17:57,599
Stay back, children.

531
00:17:57,634 --> 00:17:58,751
Jared wants to
give you aids.

532
00:17:58,786 --> 00:18:00,143
No, you don't
understand.

533
00:18:00,178 --> 00:18:01,501
Jared doesn't
have aids-Aids,

534
00:18:01,536 --> 00:18:02,933
He has assistants-

535
00:18:02,968 --> 00:18:05,868
Two guys that help him lose
weight that he calls his aides.

536
00:18:05,903 --> 00:18:07,098
Hmm.
Oh.

537
00:18:07,133 --> 00:18:09,200
You mean, jared's aides
are like my aides?

538
00:18:09,235 --> 00:18:11,199
Yes.

539
00:18:11,234 --> 00:18:13,300
You mean
you all thought-

540
00:18:13,335 --> 00:18:15,299
Oh my gosh!

541
00:18:15,334 --> 00:18:17,034
Oh boy,
do i feel stupid.

542
00:18:17,069 --> 00:18:18,618
We're so sorry, jared.

543
00:18:18,653 --> 00:18:20,132
No, no,
it was my fault.

544
00:18:20,167 --> 00:18:23,033
I can't believe i, i didn't
even think what i was saying.

545
00:18:23,068 --> 00:18:24,432
So he was saying

546
00:18:24,467 --> 00:18:26,367
Children should have help
like he had.

547
00:18:26,402 --> 00:18:27,799
Yeah.

548
00:18:27,834 --> 00:18:30,968
This has gotta be about the
biggest misunderstanding ever!

549
00:18:32,367 --> 00:18:33,732
Oh my god.

550
00:18:33,767 --> 00:18:36,667
I told my girlfriend i wanted
her to share my aides.

551
00:18:36,702 --> 00:18:39,466
Oh, no wonder she left.

552
00:18:39,501 --> 00:18:42,501
Can you imagine...
what we thought when you said

553
00:18:42,536 --> 00:18:45,234
"Aides for everyone
foundation"?

554
00:18:45,269 --> 00:18:47,934
Oh, brother!

555
00:18:47,969 --> 00:18:49,365
Hey.

556
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:51,699
We're all laughing.

557
00:18:51,734 --> 00:18:55,467
Oh hey, yeah, we would've never
laughed about this before.

558
00:18:55,502 --> 00:18:57,265
Well, don't you see
what this means?

559
00:18:57,300 --> 00:19:03,534
It's been 22.3 years, so...
aids is finally funny.

560
00:19:03,569 --> 00:19:05,632
He's right,
it's happened.

561
00:19:05,667 --> 00:19:08,767
Hey, everybody!
Aids is finally funny.

562
00:19:08,802 --> 00:19:10,032
All right!

563
00:19:10,067 --> 00:19:11,866
Woo hoo, hooray!

564
00:19:11,901 --> 00:19:13,334
I knew it would be
funny one day.

565
00:19:13,369 --> 00:19:16,833
Aids.

566
00:19:16,868 --> 00:19:17,965
Then it's time.

567
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,300
We can undo the banner.

568
00:19:19,335 --> 00:19:21,701
Ooh! Ohh!

569
00:19:21,736 --> 00:19:24,067
Hooray!

570
00:19:27,334 --> 00:19:29,234
Tom, i'm standing
in the town square

571
00:19:29,269 --> 00:19:30,766
Where just moments ago

572
00:19:30,801 --> 00:19:33,868
It was declared that aids
can finally be joked about.

573
00:19:33,903 --> 00:19:35,934
What a great day
for humanity.

574
00:19:35,969 --> 00:19:38,165
Aids quilt.

575
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:39,799
Oh boy,
this fantastic.

576
00:19:39,834 --> 00:19:41,699
I'm so glad aids
is funny now.

577
00:19:41,734 --> 00:19:43,334
Okay, so now, you wanna use our
friend in your commercials?

578
00:19:43,369 --> 00:19:46,151
Sure, okay, i pay you
15 "dorrar".

579
00:19:46,186 --> 00:19:48,126
15 dorrar?
But jared got millions.

580
00:19:48,161 --> 00:19:50,630
Hey, i'm not subway,
i chitty wok.

581
00:19:50,665 --> 00:19:53,100
Chitty wok don't have
million dollars.

582
00:19:53,135 --> 00:19:54,699
Oh, god damn it!

583
00:19:54,734 --> 00:19:55,334
Oh, just forget
the whole thing then.

584
00:19:55,369 --> 00:19:57,399
Okay.

585
00:19:57,434 --> 00:19:58,300
Hey, you kids know why
chicken cross road?

586
00:19:58,335 --> 00:20:00,232
Why?

587
00:20:00,267 --> 00:20:01,566
'Cause it had aids.

588
00:20:01,601 --> 00:20:04,265
Aids so funny.

589
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:06,699
Well, so much
for our money.

590
00:20:06,734 --> 00:20:08,265
Yeah, but y'know,
i learned something today.

591
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:10,767
It would've been wrong for us
to exploit butters' weight loss,

592
00:20:10,802 --> 00:20:12,567
Because then lots of fat people
would've believed it,

593
00:20:12,602 --> 00:20:13,467
And then gone and eaten
a ton of chinese food

594
00:20:13,502 --> 00:20:15,400
Instead of
dieting properly.

595
00:20:15,435 --> 00:20:16,799
They'd still be fat,

596
00:20:16,834 --> 00:20:18,499
And we'd be responible for
their shattered dreams.

597
00:20:18,534 --> 00:20:20,334
Yeah, i don't think like
shattering fat peoples' dreams.

598
00:20:20,369 --> 00:20:22,699
Besides, i'd get grounded.

599
00:20:22,734 --> 00:20:24,167
Oh jesus, i'm supposed
to be grounded!

600
00:20:27,367 --> 00:20:28,666
There you are, butters.

601
00:20:28,701 --> 00:20:29,950
Are my mom and dad
back home yet?

602
00:20:29,985 --> 00:20:31,200
No, but they're
due home any minute.

603
00:20:31,235 --> 00:20:32,400
Come on,
you're just in time.

604
00:20:32,435 --> 00:20:33,666
Oh boy!

605
00:20:33,701 --> 00:20:35,667
Mom and dad didn't find out
i left the house, did they?

606
00:20:35,702 --> 00:20:36,799
No, i totally
covered for you.

607
00:20:36,834 --> 00:20:38,567
They completely believed
i was you on the phone.

608
00:20:38,602 --> 00:20:39,899
Oh, goody!

609
00:20:39,934 --> 00:20:41,501
Here you go, i drew some
pictures with crayon

610
00:20:41,536 --> 00:20:42,833
So it looked like
you were here all day.

611
00:20:42,868 --> 00:20:44,334
And i ate a little food
so it looked like you ate.

612
00:20:44,369 --> 00:20:45,766
And i fed your cat.
Perfect.

613
00:20:45,801 --> 00:20:47,334
All right, i better get out
of here before they get back.

614
00:20:47,369 --> 00:20:49,666
Hey, eric.

615
00:20:49,701 --> 00:20:51,167
Thanks for
covering for me.

616
00:20:51,202 --> 00:20:52,799
You're a real pal.

617
00:20:52,834 --> 00:20:56,267
Butters, it was
my pleasure.

618
00:21:15,334 --> 00:21:16,833
Hi, mom and dad.

619
00:21:16,868 --> 00:21:19,467
Don't you "hi, mom and dad" us,
you little punk!

620
00:21:19,502 --> 00:21:20,965
Oh dad!

621
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,400
You don't even know the
trouble you're in, mister!

622
00:21:23,435 --> 00:21:24,265
What i do?
What i do?

623
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:26,767
You think
you're tough now?

624
00:21:26,802 --> 00:21:28,232
Answer me!

625
00:21:28,267 --> 00:21:29,732
Oh man,
if i was older

626
00:21:29,767 --> 00:21:31,467
I would totally start
jacking off right now.
