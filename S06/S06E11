12

13
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:32,167
* and meet some
friends of mine *

14
00:00:32,367 --> 00:00:34,065
...and in other news,

15
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:36,033
Another school shooting
has taken place,

16
00:00:36,068 --> 00:00:36,866
This time in idaho.

17
00:00:36,901 --> 00:00:38,734
As these kinds
of shootings increase

18
00:00:38,769 --> 00:00:39,866
One thing becomes clear:

19
00:00:39,901 --> 00:00:41,300
Your children are not
safe at school!

20
00:00:41,335 --> 00:00:42,265
Oh god!

21
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:44,499
Change it, change it!

22
00:00:44,534 --> 00:00:46,434
...this was the second time
a terrorist threat

23
00:00:46,469 --> 00:00:47,899
Has been made on a theme park

24
00:00:47,934 --> 00:00:50,234
Leaving everyone to realize that
children are not safe outside!

25
00:00:50,269 --> 00:00:52,365
Oh god, change it!

26
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:54,367
...and it seems there is
a new danger to look out for.

27
00:00:54,402 --> 00:00:57,098
Children who are
taken by strangers!

28
00:00:57,133 --> 00:01:01,067
The bottom line: children are
not safe in their own homes!

29
00:01:01,102 --> 00:01:02,632
Aagahghgh!
Tweek!

30
00:01:02,667 --> 00:01:06,234
Come to the kitchen, sweetie,
we need to see you real quick.

31
00:01:06,968 --> 00:01:09,084
Oh god...
they're gonna get me.

32
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:11,200
Sit down and
have some coffee, son.

33
00:01:13,133 --> 00:01:15,233
Tweek, there are starting to be
a lot of reports on the news

34
00:01:15,268 --> 00:01:17,334
About children being abducted
and we thought we should talk.

35
00:01:17,369 --> 00:01:19,699
I saw!

36
00:01:19,734 --> 00:01:22,133
You know never to talk to
strangers, right, tweek?

37
00:01:22,168 --> 00:01:23,234
You can't trust anybody.

38
00:01:23,269 --> 00:01:24,432
Oh god!

39
00:01:24,467 --> 00:01:26,032
Now, we don't
want to alarm you, son,

40
00:01:26,067 --> 00:01:29,467
But we've installed new locks on
your bedroom windows and door.

41
00:01:29,502 --> 00:01:30,899
It's important
for you to know

42
00:01:30,934 --> 00:01:33,133
Never to unlock
them night for anyone

43
00:01:33,168 --> 00:01:34,467
Except your mother and i.

44
00:01:34,502 --> 00:01:35,766
Oh jesus!

45
00:01:35,801 --> 00:01:37,867
It's just
a precaution, sweetie.

46
00:01:37,902 --> 00:01:39,934
Probably nothing
will ever happen.

47
00:01:41,534 --> 00:01:43,199
No! No!

48
00:01:43,234 --> 00:01:44,332
They're gonna get me.

49
00:01:44,367 --> 00:01:48,167
Agh, oh god...
just a dream.

50
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,234
Oh my god!

51
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:56,666
Aghgh!

52
00:01:56,701 --> 00:01:58,834
Tweek, this is
officer daniels!

53
00:01:58,869 --> 00:02:00,165
Now try and stay calm,

54
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:03,300
But we believe an
abductor is in your room!

55
00:02:03,335 --> 00:02:05,065
Inside my room?
Oh god!

56
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:06,566
Give it up, buddy
we've got you surrounded!

57
00:02:06,601 --> 00:02:08,100
Okay, tweek, i want you
to very calmly but quickly

58
00:02:08,135 --> 00:02:12,334
Walk to your door,
and come out to us!

59
00:02:12,369 --> 00:02:14,299
Oh my god!

60
00:02:14,334 --> 00:02:17,200
Oh, oh jesus
see me through this.

61
00:02:17,235 --> 00:02:20,432
Aaghgh!

62
00:02:20,467 --> 00:02:22,300
Bang, you're dead, tweek.

63
00:02:22,335 --> 00:02:23,265
What?

64
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:25,032
You failed
the test, son.

65
00:02:25,067 --> 00:02:27,133
Didn't i tell you not
to open the door for anybody

66
00:02:27,168 --> 00:02:28,200
Except your mother and i?

67
00:02:28,235 --> 00:02:28,918
Oh god!

68
00:02:28,953 --> 00:02:29,566
Oh jesus!

69
00:02:29,601 --> 00:02:31,201
What if that had been
a child abductor

70
00:02:31,236 --> 00:02:32,766
Pretending to be
a police officer, tweek?

71
00:02:32,801 --> 00:02:35,467
He could have sprayed
your brains all over the floor

72
00:02:35,502 --> 00:02:37,133
Then taken your body
off to the woods.

73
00:02:37,168 --> 00:02:38,566
Uhhho!
Aghaha!

74
00:02:38,601 --> 00:02:40,566
You've got to be
on your toes, tweek.

75
00:02:40,601 --> 00:02:42,300
All right, now go to bed
and get some rest.

76
00:02:42,335 --> 00:02:45,234
Night, pumpkin!

77
00:02:49,501 --> 00:02:51,067
I hope this movie
doesn't suck ass.

78
00:02:51,102 --> 00:02:52,117
It will.

79
00:02:52,152 --> 00:02:53,098
One please.

80
00:02:53,133 --> 00:02:55,467
Wait, that's not the usual
ticket-Taker guy!

81
00:02:55,502 --> 00:02:56,365
So?

82
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,467
So i don't
know him!

83
00:02:57,502 --> 00:02:58,384
Dude, relax.

84
00:02:58,419 --> 00:02:59,232
You relax!

85
00:02:59,267 --> 00:03:00,432
What if he wants
to kill me?

86
00:03:00,467 --> 00:03:03,899
God, what the hell do
his parents do to him?

87
00:03:03,934 --> 00:03:07,200
Excuse me, is this
the right road to breckenridge?

88
00:03:07,235 --> 00:03:08,666
Aaghgh!

89
00:03:08,701 --> 00:03:10,667
Please, i just need to know
if this is south park?

90
00:03:10,702 --> 00:03:11,234
Get away from me!

91
00:03:11,269 --> 00:03:14,432
Agh!

92
00:03:14,467 --> 00:03:18,667
Could you help me
across the street?

93
00:03:18,702 --> 00:03:19,567
I don't know you!

94
00:03:22,634 --> 00:03:23,766
Oh hey, kid!

95
00:03:23,801 --> 00:03:25,766
Oh thank god
you happened by!

96
00:03:25,801 --> 00:03:28,667
My chair ran out of juice
right on these train tracks!

97
00:03:28,702 --> 00:03:29,866
If you hadn't have
shown up-

98
00:03:29,901 --> 00:03:31,534
Well, anyway, could you
give me a push?

99
00:03:31,569 --> 00:03:32,566
Nuh-Uh!

100
00:03:32,601 --> 00:03:34,332
No, you don't understand,

101
00:03:34,367 --> 00:03:35,699
I'm paralyzed
from the neck down!

102
00:03:35,734 --> 00:03:38,033
I push the chair with this
device in front of my mouth

103
00:03:38,068 --> 00:03:39,684
But it's not working,
so, you see.

104
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:41,300
I'm not a supposed
to talk to you!

105
00:03:41,335 --> 00:03:42,532
Please!

106
00:03:42,567 --> 00:03:43,701
This isn't funny, kid,
you have to help me!

107
00:03:43,736 --> 00:03:45,534
But it could be a trick!

108
00:03:48,667 --> 00:03:51,133
Blech!
That's a pretty good trick.

109
00:03:59,434 --> 00:04:00,334
Aaaaahhhh!

110
00:04:00,369 --> 00:04:01,199
Relax, tweek.

111
00:04:01,234 --> 00:04:03,666
I am not here
to hurt you.

112
00:04:03,701 --> 00:04:05,867
I am the ghost
of human kindness.

113
00:04:05,902 --> 00:04:07,998
The ghost
of human kindness?

114
00:04:08,033 --> 00:04:10,300
You have never seen
the likes of me before!

115
00:04:10,335 --> 00:04:12,265
What do you want?

116
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:14,433
You have lost faith
in humanity, lad.

117
00:04:14,468 --> 00:04:16,567
Something i cannot
bear to see happen.

118
00:04:16,602 --> 00:04:17,933
How can i help it?

119
00:04:17,968 --> 00:04:20,000
It seems like everywhere i turn,
somebody is out to get me!

120
00:04:20,035 --> 00:04:22,732
That is the world
that the news reports!

121
00:04:22,767 --> 00:04:25,734
It is the world that adults
preoccupy themselves with!

122
00:04:25,769 --> 00:04:27,300
But it is not the world
as it is!

123
00:04:27,335 --> 00:04:28,232
It isn't?

124
00:04:28,267 --> 00:04:31,566
Look here, tweek.

125
00:04:31,601 --> 00:04:34,734
This woman is on her way
to the retirement home.

126
00:04:34,769 --> 00:04:35,899
She doesn't get paid,

127
00:04:35,934 --> 00:04:38,098
She volunteers her time
to talk with lonely,

128
00:04:38,133 --> 00:04:42,467
Elderly people who want
nothing more than a friend.

129
00:04:42,502 --> 00:04:44,767
But do you hear
about her on the news?

130
00:04:44,802 --> 00:04:45,965
No!

131
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,365
Now gaze upon
this humble house, tweek.

132
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:52,033
Inside, there are two people
who have adopted needy children.

133
00:04:52,068 --> 00:04:54,667
They were strangers
to those kids once,

134
00:04:54,702 --> 00:04:58,200
Now they are loving parents.

135
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:00,332
Now look here, boy.

136
00:05:00,367 --> 00:05:02,998
A car has broken down
with a flat tire

137
00:05:03,033 --> 00:05:04,998
And two complete strangers
have stopped to help.

138
00:05:05,033 --> 00:05:08,334
Will their kindness be reported
on the news tomorrow?

139
00:05:08,369 --> 00:05:10,766
I think not!

140
00:05:10,801 --> 00:05:14,200
Are you starting
to understand, boy?

141
00:05:14,235 --> 00:05:16,232
I think so.

142
00:05:16,267 --> 00:05:17,834
You mean that
even though all the news

143
00:05:17,869 --> 00:05:19,268
Is about murderers
and abductors,

144
00:05:19,303 --> 00:05:20,751
Those kind of people
only make up

145
00:05:20,786 --> 00:05:22,200
A very small part
of the world.

146
00:05:22,235 --> 00:05:23,666
That's right, lad.

147
00:05:23,701 --> 00:05:25,267
So do you think you can learn
to trust people now?

148
00:05:25,302 --> 00:05:27,151
I'll try.

149
00:05:27,186 --> 00:05:28,965
Good.

150
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,300
Then why don't you get
into the back of my van,

151
00:05:30,335 --> 00:05:33,100
And i'll drive you home.

152
00:05:35,567 --> 00:05:37,000
Your van?

153
00:05:38,501 --> 00:05:40,534
All right, johnston,
give it up!

154
00:05:40,569 --> 00:05:42,934
Damn! Damn! Damn! Damn!

155
00:05:42,969 --> 00:05:45,265
Oh, i was so close.

156
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:46,850
What the hell
is going on?

157
00:05:46,885 --> 00:05:48,276
Tweek, tweek,
are you okay?

158
00:05:48,311 --> 00:05:49,622
Did he hurt you, son? No!

159
00:05:49,657 --> 00:05:50,899
Then we aren't
too late.

160
00:05:50,934 --> 00:05:52,032
His name is
frederick johnston.

161
00:05:52,067 --> 00:05:53,632
He's been abducting
children by dressing up

162
00:05:53,667 --> 00:05:55,133
Like the ghost of human kindness
for over a year now.

163
00:05:55,168 --> 00:05:57,634
And i would have gotten
away with it again

164
00:05:57,669 --> 00:06:00,100
If it weren't for you
meddling policemen!

165
00:06:00,135 --> 00:06:01,566
What's going on?

166
00:06:01,601 --> 00:06:04,234
A stranger was caught
trying to abduct the tweek boy!

167
00:06:04,269 --> 00:06:05,265
An abductor,
in our own town?

168
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:07,866
Oh my god, what are we
going to do?

169
00:06:07,901 --> 00:06:10,334
Rabble, rabble, rabble, rabble!

170
00:06:10,369 --> 00:06:12,699
People, people, calm down.

171
00:06:12,734 --> 00:06:13,667
Well what are
we going to do, mayor?

172
00:06:13,702 --> 00:06:15,199
We have to stop
these abductors

173
00:06:15,234 --> 00:06:17,033
From being able to get
into our town!

174
00:06:17,068 --> 00:06:18,232
Rabble! Rabble! Rabble!

175
00:06:18,267 --> 00:06:22,200
Yes, but standing out here
yelling "rabble, rabble, rabble"

176
00:06:22,235 --> 00:06:23,732
Isn't going
to help anything!

177
00:06:23,767 --> 00:06:26,501
But we don't know
what else to do, mayor!

178
00:06:26,536 --> 00:06:29,067
Rabble, rabble, rabble!

179
00:06:31,667 --> 00:06:36,133
People, what do you
think we need to do?

180
00:06:36,168 --> 00:06:37,132
Uhh...

181
00:06:37,167 --> 00:06:40,067
Well, we need to find a way
to close our town off

182
00:06:40,102 --> 00:06:41,499
From unwanted strangers!

183
00:06:41,534 --> 00:06:45,334
Yes, we need a barrier
to protect our kids!

184
00:06:45,369 --> 00:06:46,799
That's it,
a wall.

185
00:06:46,834 --> 00:06:49,550
We could to build a huge city
wall all around south park

186
00:06:49,585 --> 00:06:52,267
So that we have complete
control over who comes in.

187
00:06:52,302 --> 00:06:55,585
That's not a bad idea,
a city wall.

188
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:58,868
But who can we get
to build it?

189
00:06:59,734 --> 00:07:01,868
And so, we want you
to design and build

190
00:07:01,903 --> 00:07:05,934
A great wall all
around the city.

191
00:07:05,969 --> 00:07:06,632
I don't build walls!

192
00:07:06,667 --> 00:07:08,899
I just own and
operate city wok!

193
00:07:08,934 --> 00:07:10,501
We just think that
you're the best person

194
00:07:10,536 --> 00:07:11,866
To put up a wall,

195
00:07:11,901 --> 00:07:12,968
We're sure you've got it
in your blood.

196
00:07:13,003 --> 00:07:14,065
Ohhh i get it!

197
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:18,234
Just because i chinese you
fink i can build a wall!

198
00:07:18,269 --> 00:07:19,432
That is bullsh-T!

199
00:07:19,467 --> 00:07:20,933
I'm not
a stereotype, okay?

200
00:07:20,968 --> 00:07:23,534
Just because i'm chinese
doesn't mean i go around

201
00:07:23,569 --> 00:07:24,632
Building walls!

202
00:07:24,667 --> 00:07:26,734
I'm just a normal person
like all of you,

203
00:07:26,769 --> 00:07:28,833
I eat rice and
drive really slow

204
00:07:28,868 --> 00:07:31,701
Just like the rest of you,
i'm not a stereotype!

205
00:07:31,736 --> 00:07:33,132
Please,
mr. Twang lu kim.

206
00:07:33,167 --> 00:07:36,267
Your ancestors put up a great
wall that kept mongolians out

207
00:07:36,302 --> 00:07:37,532
For thousands of years.

208
00:07:37,567 --> 00:07:40,934
We know you can
do it for us.

209
00:07:54,334 --> 00:07:57,132
Hey, hey!
Hey!

210
00:07:57,167 --> 00:07:59,083
What the hell you doing?

211
00:07:59,118 --> 00:08:00,543
<i>Tsao nugu kwaaa!</i>

212
00:08:00,578 --> 00:08:01,933
Mongolians!

213
00:08:01,968 --> 00:08:04,167
What the hell
is mongolian doing here?

214
00:08:04,202 --> 00:08:07,566
You, mongolian!

215
00:08:07,601 --> 00:08:09,267
Don't you
break down my wall!

216
00:08:09,302 --> 00:08:11,432
Get outta here!

217
00:08:11,467 --> 00:08:14,534
Mongolian!

218
00:08:15,167 --> 00:08:16,933
<i>Naini tantsu kwaaaa!</i>

219
00:08:16,968 --> 00:08:19,584
Goddamit, how come every time
us chinese put up a wall

220
00:08:19,619 --> 00:08:22,200
Stupid mongolians have
to come and knock it down?

221
00:08:26,033 --> 00:08:29,501
Stan, our abduction
problems are over!

222
00:08:29,536 --> 00:08:31,000
We got the new child tracker!

223
00:08:31,035 --> 00:08:31,699
Child tracker?

224
00:08:31,734 --> 00:08:33,599
It's a little
electrical device

225
00:08:33,634 --> 00:08:35,567
That can tell us where
you are anywhere on earth.

226
00:08:35,602 --> 00:08:37,501
If anybody takes you,
we'll be able to locate

227
00:08:37,536 --> 00:08:40,601
Your exact location
within two meters.

228
00:08:41,834 --> 00:08:43,901
There, i think
that's got it.

229
00:08:43,936 --> 00:08:46,365
Dude, no way.

230
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:47,666
I'm not wearing
a child tracker.

231
00:08:47,701 --> 00:08:49,334
You can barely even tell
you have one on.

232
00:08:49,369 --> 00:08:50,501
I'm not going
to school like this!

233
00:08:50,536 --> 00:08:51,634
What will all
the other guys say?

234
00:08:51,669 --> 00:08:54,267
I wouldn't
worry about that.

235
00:08:56,834 --> 00:08:58,132
So weak.

236
00:08:58,167 --> 00:08:59,901
So weak, dude.

237
00:08:59,936 --> 00:09:00,899
Man.

238
00:09:00,934 --> 00:09:02,467
Why did you have to go
and be abducted, tweek?

239
00:09:02,502 --> 00:09:04,000
Now all our parents
are freaking out.

240
00:09:04,035 --> 00:09:04,501
I didn't mean to!

241
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:09,967
Okay.

242
00:09:10,002 --> 00:09:11,634
Finally.

243
00:09:12,334 --> 00:09:14,501
Oh, no!

244
00:09:18,267 --> 00:09:21,133
It's those goddamn
mongolians again!

245
00:09:21,168 --> 00:09:22,098
Stop!

246
00:09:22,133 --> 00:09:24,067
Stop right there,
mongolians!

247
00:09:24,102 --> 00:09:25,866
God damn it stop!

248
00:09:25,901 --> 00:09:31,167
Stop breaking down my city wall,
you stupid mongolians!

249
00:09:31,202 --> 00:09:35,968
All right,
you sons of bitches,

250
00:09:36,003 --> 00:09:38,901
What the hell?

251
00:09:40,501 --> 00:09:42,367
Aw, sh-T!

252
00:09:44,634 --> 00:09:47,566
Oh goddamn mongolians!

253
00:09:47,601 --> 00:09:50,967
I gonna get you,
mongolians!

254
00:09:51,002 --> 00:09:54,334
Stop breaking
my city wall!

255
00:09:54,369 --> 00:09:57,001
Aw, goddammit!

256
00:09:57,036 --> 00:09:59,599
<i>Bi urgalsan!</i>

257
00:09:59,634 --> 00:10:04,133
That's the last time you gonna
break down my city wall!

258
00:10:04,168 --> 00:10:07,133
You hear me,
mongolian?!

259
00:10:07,168 --> 00:10:10,033
God damn mongolians.

260
00:10:12,634 --> 00:10:13,933
All right, cows!

261
00:10:13,968 --> 00:10:15,601
We're gonna go out there and
we're gonna give 'em hell!

262
00:10:15,636 --> 00:10:17,501
But wait, where's
the other team?

263
00:10:17,536 --> 00:10:19,501
There is no other team.

264
00:10:19,536 --> 00:10:20,799
Huh?

265
00:10:20,834 --> 00:10:22,784
Well, we put a wall around
the city to get outsiders out.

266
00:10:22,819 --> 00:10:24,734
You don't think we want a bunch
of strangers coming in

267
00:10:24,769 --> 00:10:25,965
To play ball, do you?

268
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,734
But there's no other team,
that won't be any fun.

269
00:10:27,769 --> 00:10:29,467
Don't worry, it'll still
be fun for us.

270
00:10:34,567 --> 00:10:36,383
Go cows! Go cows!

271
00:10:36,418 --> 00:10:38,200
Go cows! Go cows!

272
00:10:38,235 --> 00:10:40,701
Play ball!

273
00:10:42,367 --> 00:10:45,501
Steeeeee-Rike!

274
00:10:50,868 --> 00:10:53,532
South park cows
do it again!

275
00:10:53,567 --> 00:10:55,417
Congratulations
on your victory, boys!

276
00:10:55,452 --> 00:10:57,267
Dude, we weren't
playing anybody!

277
00:10:57,302 --> 00:10:58,965
Yeah, and
you kicked ass!

278
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,467
Isn't this awesome having
a great wall around our city?

279
00:11:02,502 --> 00:11:04,801
Nobody in town
except for our good friends!

280
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,965
Hey, sshh!
Quiet everybody!

281
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,632
And this newest study
reveals more

282
00:11:10,667 --> 00:11:12,334
About child abductions than
we apparently knew before, tom.

283
00:11:12,369 --> 00:11:14,232
Turn it up.

284
00:11:14,267 --> 00:11:15,399
That's right, chris,

285
00:11:15,434 --> 00:11:16,651
This newest
study shows that

286
00:11:16,686 --> 00:11:17,976
The majority of
child abductions

287
00:11:18,011 --> 00:11:19,232
Are not committed by strangers,

288
00:11:19,267 --> 00:11:22,801
But by somebody the child
knows in their own town!

289
00:11:22,836 --> 00:11:25,968
The report further states
that it is because

290
00:11:26,003 --> 00:11:27,599
The child trusts
the individual

291
00:11:27,634 --> 00:11:29,566
That problems occur
in the first place.

292
00:11:29,601 --> 00:11:31,567
Well, i guess the enemy
is in our own backyard

293
00:11:31,602 --> 00:11:32,718
So to speak.

294
00:11:32,753 --> 00:11:33,799
Sure does, tom.

295
00:11:33,834 --> 00:11:34,899
All right, thanks, chris.

296
00:11:34,934 --> 00:11:36,250
Is the weather
going to turn-

297
00:11:36,285 --> 00:11:37,909
Well, if you'll
all excuse us.

298
00:11:37,944 --> 00:11:39,534
I think
we'll be going now.

299
00:11:39,569 --> 00:11:40,666
Yeah, come along, kyle.

300
00:11:40,701 --> 00:11:42,634
Stanly, time for us
to get back to the house.

301
00:11:42,669 --> 00:11:44,300
I'm not done
with my pizza.

302
00:11:44,335 --> 00:11:45,267
Now, stanly!

303
00:11:48,267 --> 00:11:51,332
There we go,
all finished.

304
00:11:51,367 --> 00:11:53,965
My mongolian
missile defense system!

305
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,283
Those mongolians try to break
down my city wall again,

306
00:11:57,318 --> 00:12:00,567
They gonna get a big
heat-Seeking missile surprise!

307
00:12:03,501 --> 00:12:05,734
Oh!
Herro mongolian!

308
00:12:05,769 --> 00:12:06,566
Yeah.

309
00:12:06,601 --> 00:12:08,799
You come to break down
my city wall?

310
00:12:08,834 --> 00:12:12,300
Oh, you gonna frow
dat baseball at my wall?

311
00:12:12,335 --> 00:12:14,284
Oh no, not a baseball!

312
00:12:14,319 --> 00:12:16,326
I'm pretty scared.

313
00:12:16,361 --> 00:12:18,299
But you know what?

314
00:12:18,334 --> 00:12:19,632
I might have
something here

315
00:12:19,667 --> 00:12:21,200
That's a little bigger
than a baseball!

316
00:12:21,235 --> 00:12:26,167
Say harro
to my rittle friend!

317
00:12:36,234 --> 00:12:37,534
Oh cwap.

318
00:12:41,267 --> 00:12:43,767
Ughhhh...

319
00:12:47,567 --> 00:12:49,065
God damn mongolians!

320
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:54,000
You break down my city wall
for the last time!

321
00:12:57,033 --> 00:12:58,833
Dude, this is worse
than child tracker.

322
00:12:58,868 --> 00:13:01,701
It's okay, boys, just
act as if we weren't here.

323
00:13:01,736 --> 00:13:04,133
Right, do what
you normally would do.

324
00:13:05,467 --> 00:13:07,050
You're such
a fat ass, cartman.

325
00:13:07,085 --> 00:13:08,634
At least i'm not
a stupid jew.

326
00:13:08,669 --> 00:13:09,200
What-What, whaaat?

327
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:13,499
M'kay, kids, so now
who can tell me

328
00:13:13,534 --> 00:13:16,701
What year the first
moon landing took place?

329
00:13:16,736 --> 00:13:18,167
Uh, how about you, clyde?

330
00:13:18,202 --> 00:13:20,065
No helping!

331
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:23,901
M'kay, i'm not really sure
having all the parents here

332
00:13:23,936 --> 00:13:25,065
Is a good idea!

333
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:27,601
Well, maybe things would be
better if we could trust people

334
00:13:27,636 --> 00:13:28,965
Like the stoch's!

335
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,300
Us? Your family has always
been the shifty-Eyed ones!

336
00:13:34,334 --> 00:13:36,065
Uh, this is just
too much to take.

337
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:39,300
Mom, dad, could you
please leave me alone?

338
00:13:39,335 --> 00:13:41,199
We just want
to make sure

339
00:13:41,234 --> 00:13:43,200
Nobody hurts you,
junior, m'kay.

340
00:13:43,235 --> 00:13:44,834
M'kay.

341
00:13:48,467 --> 00:13:49,998
Ha ha ha!
My master plan!

342
00:13:50,033 --> 00:13:51,899
When those mongolians
come next time

343
00:13:51,934 --> 00:13:53,334
I pour this sweet-And-Sour pork
on their heads.

344
00:13:53,369 --> 00:13:55,466
Ha ha!

345
00:13:55,501 --> 00:13:57,017
Sweet-And-Sour pork
so hot and sticky,

346
00:13:57,052 --> 00:13:58,534
Mongolians will
stick right to the wall

347
00:13:58,569 --> 00:14:00,601
And scream, "awoooooo!"

348
00:14:00,636 --> 00:14:02,234
I can't wait.

349
00:14:09,834 --> 00:14:13,000
Oh, i get it,
a trojan mongolian horse!

350
00:14:13,035 --> 00:14:16,167
Mongolians hiding inside
thinking that

351
00:14:16,202 --> 00:14:17,365
I'll bring it
in the city wall

352
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:20,383
Then mongolians pop out and
destroy wall from inside out

353
00:14:20,418 --> 00:14:23,367
Without getting sweet-And-Sour
pork on their heads!

354
00:14:23,402 --> 00:14:25,367
Okay,
i'll pray along.

355
00:14:25,402 --> 00:14:26,766
Oh rook!

356
00:14:26,801 --> 00:14:30,667
My very own
mongolian trojan horse.

357
00:14:30,702 --> 00:14:32,098
Gee, what a surprise,

358
00:14:32,133 --> 00:14:36,000
I guess mongolians aren't such
crappy, smelly people after all.

359
00:14:36,035 --> 00:14:37,265
Yeah.

360
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:39,766
Yeah, what
a great present!

361
00:14:39,801 --> 00:14:43,367
I just gonna push it
inside the gate

362
00:14:43,402 --> 00:14:45,367
And show it
to all my friends.

363
00:14:45,402 --> 00:14:47,734
Ahaah!

364
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:50,367
Oh it's sweet-And-Sour pork!

365
00:14:54,367 --> 00:14:58,584
I gonna get you mongolians

366
00:14:58,619 --> 00:15:02,801
If it's the last thing i do!

367
00:15:05,334 --> 00:15:07,734
...and so all the residents
of manhattan

368
00:15:07,769 --> 00:15:08,732
Are prepared to evacuate

369
00:15:08,767 --> 00:15:12,067
If ms. Clinton's ass
gets any bigger.

370
00:15:12,102 --> 00:15:13,098
And in other news,

371
00:15:13,133 --> 00:15:15,200
New findings on the increase
in child abductions.

372
00:15:15,235 --> 00:15:17,332
Oh jesus,
turn it up, honey.

373
00:15:17,367 --> 00:15:20,100
The study shows that the most
likely abductors of children

374
00:15:20,135 --> 00:15:21,965
Are the parents themselves!

375
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,667
The study reveals that nine out
of every ten abduction cases

376
00:15:25,702 --> 00:15:28,267
Are committed by
the child's mother or father.

377
00:15:28,302 --> 00:15:29,499
The bottom line being

378
00:15:29,534 --> 00:15:33,167
That your children aren't safe,
even from you!

379
00:15:35,133 --> 00:15:36,098
Where are you going?

380
00:15:36,133 --> 00:15:37,265
I'm just going
to go upstairs

381
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:38,367
And see if tweek
is still in his bed.

382
00:15:38,402 --> 00:15:40,399
Oh?

383
00:15:40,434 --> 00:15:41,500
I think
i'll go with you.

384
00:15:41,535 --> 00:15:42,532
It's okay, i can do it.

385
00:15:42,567 --> 00:15:43,701
I just want
to make sure that-

386
00:15:43,736 --> 00:15:44,933
That i don't abduct him?

387
00:15:44,968 --> 00:15:46,834
<i>How do i know you haven't
done it already?</i>

388
00:15:46,869 --> 00:15:48,401
Me? I would never
abduct our son!

389
00:15:48,436 --> 00:15:50,301
That's not what
the new study says!

390
00:15:50,336 --> 00:15:52,132
But what are
we supposed to do?

391
00:15:52,167 --> 00:15:56,167
How can we protect
tweek from ourselves?

392
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:00,965
Here you go, stanly.

393
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,667
This should hold you over
for three years.

394
00:16:02,702 --> 00:16:04,032
But why do
i have to leave?

395
00:16:04,067 --> 00:16:05,968
The news says that at your age
you aren't safe with us, son.

396
00:16:06,003 --> 00:16:09,300
You have to get out of here
before we abduct you.

397
00:16:09,335 --> 00:16:10,817
Goodbye, son,
remember to eat right.

398
00:16:10,852 --> 00:16:12,300
Look out for
your brother, kyle.

399
00:16:12,335 --> 00:16:14,399
You're the man, now.

400
00:16:14,434 --> 00:16:16,601
Oh boys, don't ever forget
that we love you!

401
00:16:24,033 --> 00:16:25,732
Be careful out there!

402
00:16:25,767 --> 00:16:28,299
Where are
we supposed to go?

403
00:16:28,334 --> 00:16:32,200
We can't tell you because
we can't know where you are!

404
00:16:32,235 --> 00:16:35,033
Oh this is
terrible!

405
00:16:35,068 --> 00:16:35,833
Go on, kids!

406
00:16:35,868 --> 00:16:38,968
Go! Go and
don't look back!

407
00:16:44,801 --> 00:16:47,367
Good-Bye, kids,
we'll never forget you.

408
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:59,133
Dude, sometimes i think
our parents are really stupid.

409
00:17:07,167 --> 00:17:10,567
Oh, hey dog,
over here,

410
00:17:10,602 --> 00:17:11,499
Over here, dog.

411
00:17:11,534 --> 00:17:15,033
Got some sweet-And-Sour
for you.

412
00:17:15,068 --> 00:17:15,766
Good dog!

413
00:17:15,801 --> 00:17:18,734
That's it,
keep licking, dog!

414
00:17:19,601 --> 00:17:20,332
Ha ha haaaa!

415
00:17:20,367 --> 00:17:22,132
I'm free mongolians!

416
00:17:22,167 --> 00:17:25,501
And now i'm gonna
make you pay!

417
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:28,666
Finally,
some good news tonight.

418
00:17:28,701 --> 00:17:31,100
It's been several days
since any child abductions

419
00:17:31,135 --> 00:17:32,365
Have taken place,

420
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,300
The main reason, parents don't
know where their children are.

421
00:17:36,968 --> 00:17:37,933
What's the matter?

422
00:17:37,968 --> 00:17:40,834
Oh, it's just-
I was wondering if stan's okay.

423
00:17:40,869 --> 00:17:43,235
Oh, i'm sure he's made it
somewhere safe by now.

424
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:45,601
Do you really think we did
the right thing, randy?

425
00:17:45,636 --> 00:17:47,501
Sending all the young kids
in town off

426
00:17:47,536 --> 00:17:48,799
To live on their own?

427
00:17:48,834 --> 00:17:50,400
Sweetheart,
you saw the news.

428
00:17:50,435 --> 00:17:51,432
I know.

429
00:17:51,467 --> 00:17:52,632
Don't you worry.

430
00:17:52,667 --> 00:17:54,165
I'm sure that
stan and all the other kids

431
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:56,667
Are somewhere safe, off
in a whole new city by now

432
00:17:56,702 --> 00:17:59,468
Making a new life
for themselves.

433
00:17:59,503 --> 00:18:02,202
<i>Ta terniig dakhiad

<i>Sain banaaaaaaa!</i>

439
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:20,532
All right, mongolians!

440
00:18:20,567 --> 00:18:23,234
Your only way through
this wall is through me.

441
00:18:23,269 --> 00:18:25,132
This is my last stand!

442
00:18:25,167 --> 00:18:26,200
I'm gonna do
my war dance now!

443
00:18:34,901 --> 00:18:37,666
Does my dance scare you,
mongolians?

444
00:18:37,701 --> 00:18:41,067
Yeah, you think you
wanna piece of this?

445
00:18:50,968 --> 00:18:54,067
This is the ancient chinese
dance of- Oh, herro, kids.

446
00:18:54,102 --> 00:18:57,868
Be careful, there's
mongolians up there.

447
00:19:09,033 --> 00:19:11,434
Oh cwap.

448
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:18,399
What's going on?

449
00:19:18,434 --> 00:19:19,666
I heard an explosion!

450
00:19:19,701 --> 00:19:22,868
God damn mongolians
attack city wall again!

451
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:25,265
Mongolians?

452
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:27,000
What the hell
are they doing here?

453
00:19:27,035 --> 00:19:27,467
Rabble! Rabble, rabble!

454
00:19:29,534 --> 00:19:30,666
Wait a minute.

455
00:19:30,701 --> 00:19:34,767
Those mongolians are
our children.

456
00:19:34,802 --> 00:19:35,784
Ike?

457
00:19:35,819 --> 00:19:36,732
Kyle?

458
00:19:36,767 --> 00:19:38,334
My son has
become a mongolian!?

459
00:19:38,369 --> 00:19:41,299
No! Nooooo!

460
00:19:41,334 --> 00:19:43,499
Oh god,
what have we done?

461
00:19:43,534 --> 00:19:45,300
We sent our children away
and now they don't

462
00:19:45,335 --> 00:19:46,801
Even remember
who they are.

463
00:19:46,836 --> 00:19:48,267
Kids, don't you
remember us?

464
00:19:48,302 --> 00:19:50,365
Wait...

465
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:51,868
I learned some
mongolian in college.

466
00:19:51,903 --> 00:19:53,234
Uh, let's see.

467
00:19:53,269 --> 00:19:54,866
Kids!

468
00:19:54,901 --> 00:19:57,032
<i>Uhh, bi khuutel.</i>

469
00:19:57,067 --> 00:20:00,633
<i>Bi sanakh khuutel.
Ta tasalbaraa uzuulenuu.</i>

470
00:20:00,668 --> 00:20:04,200
Oh my god, our parents
are so stupid, dude.

471
00:20:04,235 --> 00:20:06,965
<i>Biii khuutel.</i>

472
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,432
We are your parents,

473
00:20:08,467 --> 00:20:10,517
You use to live here
with us.

474
00:20:10,552 --> 00:20:11,893
Yeah, it was like
four days ago!

475
00:20:11,928 --> 00:20:13,234
They're starting
to remember!

476
00:20:13,269 --> 00:20:15,466
Staaaaan.

477
00:20:15,501 --> 00:20:18,167
Your name is staaan.

478
00:20:18,202 --> 00:20:20,799
Uh-Huh, stan marsh.

479
00:20:20,834 --> 00:20:23,634
That's it!
Remember, son,

480
00:20:23,669 --> 00:20:25,267
Remeeeeember!

481
00:20:29,067 --> 00:20:29,867
We're sorry, tweek!

482
00:20:29,902 --> 00:20:30,632
Are you okay, clyde?

483
00:20:30,667 --> 00:20:33,634
Oh son, can you
ever forgive us!

484
00:20:33,669 --> 00:20:34,400
I'm over here, dad.

485
00:20:34,435 --> 00:20:36,365
Oh.

486
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:37,899
We're sorry, kids,

487
00:20:37,934 --> 00:20:39,400
We just let all those
sensationalist news reports

488
00:20:39,435 --> 00:20:40,699
Go to our heads!

489
00:20:40,734 --> 00:20:42,532
Oh my god, do you see
what this means?

490
00:20:42,567 --> 00:20:45,084
The ghost of human kindness
was right all along!

491
00:20:45,119 --> 00:20:47,601
You mean how he said
we should trust each other

492
00:20:47,636 --> 00:20:48,799
Or how he abducted
children?

493
00:20:48,834 --> 00:20:51,667
The... uh, no, the part about
being more trusting.

494
00:20:51,702 --> 00:20:54,501
We should follow what
he said, not what he did.

495
00:20:54,536 --> 00:20:55,799
Yeah!

496
00:20:55,834 --> 00:20:58,000
No, no, you know
who was right along?

497
00:20:58,035 --> 00:20:59,165
The mongolians.

498
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:02,501
They knew that you can't
just wall yourself off

499
00:21:02,536 --> 00:21:03,799
From the outside world.

500
00:21:03,834 --> 00:21:06,084
Putting walls up
never helps anything

501
00:21:06,119 --> 00:21:08,334
Tearing them down
brings us together.

502
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:14,501
Oh, you better be not say
what i think you gonna say.

503
00:21:14,536 --> 00:21:17,718
Mr. Lu kim,
tear down this wall!

504
00:21:17,753 --> 00:21:20,866
Oh god, i hate
this whole city!

505
00:21:20,901 --> 00:21:22,300
Randy, can we just
take our son home now?

506
00:21:22,335 --> 00:21:24,566
Yes, kids.

507
00:21:24,601 --> 00:21:27,417
With us, now come.

508
00:21:27,452 --> 00:21:30,234
Home.
Hooommeee.

509
00:21:32,067 --> 00:21:33,032
Jesus christ, dude,

510
00:21:33,067 --> 00:21:35,300
They've done some stupid crap
but jesus christ!

00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
