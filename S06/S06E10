14
00:00:35,334 --> 00:00:37,599
Ooh, hello boys.

15
00:00:37,634 --> 00:00:39,632
Hi, the school
called and said

16
00:00:39,667 --> 00:00:40,734
We all have to start
going to class again.

17
00:00:40,769 --> 00:00:42,634
Ooh, but i thought
your teacher died.

18
00:00:42,669 --> 00:00:43,799
She did, but now
they're saying

19
00:00:43,834 --> 00:00:45,501
We have to start
going back to school anyways.

20
00:00:45,536 --> 00:00:46,399
It's totally gay.

21
00:00:46,434 --> 00:00:47,699
Oh, well,
i'll tell eric

22
00:00:47,734 --> 00:00:51,033
He's just down in the basement
playing with his dolls.

23
00:00:51,334 --> 00:00:54,701
Cartman likes
to play with dolls?

24
00:00:55,501 --> 00:00:56,466
Hello, precious.

25
00:00:56,501 --> 00:00:59,200
Yes, that's
a good precious.

26
00:01:02,934 --> 00:01:05,933
Now it takes the lotion
from the basket...

27
00:01:05,968 --> 00:01:08,200
Oh please, mister,
please let me out of here!

28
00:01:08,235 --> 00:01:10,034
It puts the lotion
on its skin

29
00:01:10,069 --> 00:01:11,834
Or else it gets
the hose again!

30
00:01:11,869 --> 00:01:12,866
Bark bark bark!

31
00:01:12,901 --> 00:01:14,566
Yes, that's
a good precious...

32
00:01:14,601 --> 00:01:16,200
Okay, now it puts the lotion
back in the basket.

33
00:01:16,235 --> 00:01:18,332
Please, mister,
let me out!

34
00:01:18,367 --> 00:01:21,032
It puts the lotion
back in the basket-

35
00:01:21,067 --> 00:01:23,734
I miss my mom, mister,
i want to see my mommy!

36
00:01:23,769 --> 00:01:25,367
Put the lotion in the
f- King basket!

37
00:01:25,402 --> 00:01:26,551
Sweetie-

38
00:01:26,586 --> 00:01:27,666
Yes, mom?

39
00:01:27,701 --> 00:01:29,801
You have to get
ready for school.

40
00:01:29,836 --> 00:01:31,866
No, our teacher's dead,
remember?

41
00:01:31,901 --> 00:01:33,534
Yes, but they said
two weeks off was enough

42
00:01:33,569 --> 00:01:35,133
And they want
everyone back.

43
00:01:35,168 --> 00:01:36,866
Two weeks isn't enough.

44
00:01:36,901 --> 00:01:38,534
I'm not over our teacher's
tragic death.

45
00:01:38,569 --> 00:01:39,699
I'm still shook up.

46
00:01:39,734 --> 00:01:40,501
You'll get
over it, honey.

47
00:01:40,536 --> 00:01:43,801
But i wanna playyyyyy.

48
00:01:47,634 --> 00:01:48,534
I can't believe
it's been 2 weeks

49
00:01:48,569 --> 00:01:49,418
Since i've
seen you guys!

50
00:01:49,453 --> 00:01:51,010
What have you
been doing?

51
00:01:51,045 --> 00:01:52,532
Hey, guys!
Hey, bebe!

52
00:01:52,567 --> 00:01:54,567
You guys uh, notice
anything different?

53
00:01:54,602 --> 00:01:56,299
Oh my god, bebe
you got boobs!

54
00:01:56,334 --> 00:01:58,732
Yeah, they started
coming in last week!

55
00:01:58,767 --> 00:02:00,567
At first i thought they
were just mosquito bites

56
00:02:00,602 --> 00:02:01,766
But then they
didn't go away!

57
00:02:01,801 --> 00:02:04,732
M'kay, kids, let's take our
seats, please, m'kay.

58
00:02:04,767 --> 00:02:07,534
I know this has been a difficult
couple weeks for you all

59
00:02:07,569 --> 00:02:09,132
With the untimely death
of your teacher

60
00:02:09,167 --> 00:02:12,801
But it's time for us to try
and move on and learn, m'kay?

61
00:02:12,836 --> 00:02:14,432
Mr. Mackey, i don't
think i'm over

62
00:02:14,467 --> 00:02:16,267
The teacher's tragic death yet,
i need more time.

63
00:02:16,302 --> 00:02:17,901
It just... it
still hurts, y'know?

64
00:02:17,936 --> 00:02:18,632
Can i go home?

65
00:02:18,667 --> 00:02:20,632
No, eric, what
we're going to do

66
00:02:20,667 --> 00:02:24,383
Is learn to hide our emotions
with math problems.

67
00:02:24,418 --> 00:02:28,100
So let's start with some
multiplication tables...

68
00:02:29,634 --> 00:02:31,968
Dude, look at bebe...

69
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:34,701
Something seems
different about her.

70
00:02:34,736 --> 00:02:35,933
Yeah, i noticed that too.

71
00:02:35,968 --> 00:02:37,834
Did she get a haircut
or something?

72
00:02:37,869 --> 00:02:39,632
I don't know...

73
00:02:39,667 --> 00:02:42,134
Hey, token, i never
really noticed before

74
00:02:42,169 --> 00:02:44,601
But that girl bebe
is really kind of cool.

75
00:02:44,636 --> 00:02:46,267
I was just thinking
the same thing.

76
00:02:46,302 --> 00:02:47,432
<i>It's like she's a girl</i>

77
00:02:47,467 --> 00:02:49,367
But she's someone
you could hang out with.

78
00:02:49,402 --> 00:02:52,200
Yeah, bebe is
kind of cool, huh?

79
00:02:53,968 --> 00:02:55,567
Hey, craig, is that
the same shirt

80
00:02:55,602 --> 00:02:57,167
That bebe chick
always wears?

81
00:02:57,202 --> 00:02:58,632
I don't know, why?

82
00:02:58,667 --> 00:03:02,067
It just seems like
a really awesome shirt.

83
00:03:02,102 --> 00:03:05,467
Yeah, it kind of does.

84
00:03:10,067 --> 00:03:13,934
M'kay, so who can tell me the
answer to the first problem,

85
00:03:13,969 --> 00:03:15,133
"Six times eight".

86
00:03:15,168 --> 00:03:16,532
Bebe?

87
00:03:16,567 --> 00:03:18,817
Oh, uh...
forty eight?

88
00:03:18,852 --> 00:03:21,032
Whoa!Whoa!
Whoa!

89
00:03:21,067 --> 00:03:22,133
That is an
awesome answer!

90
00:03:22,168 --> 00:03:23,299
Yeah!
Yeah!Yeah!

91
00:03:23,334 --> 00:03:24,766
Dude, bebe is
really smart.

92
00:03:24,801 --> 00:03:26,201
Yeah, i never
noticed that before.

93
00:03:26,236 --> 00:03:27,601
Maybe she's actually
cool enough

94
00:03:27,636 --> 00:03:28,901
To hang out with us.

95
00:03:28,936 --> 00:03:30,200
Yeah, maybe!

96
00:03:31,434 --> 00:03:32,599
But i was like-

97
00:03:32,634 --> 00:03:34,267
"I'm not buying those shoes
for twenty dollars!"

98
00:03:35,834 --> 00:03:36,968
Uh... hey, bebe.

99
00:03:37,003 --> 00:03:37,998
Yeah?

100
00:03:38,033 --> 00:03:39,734
Uh... we're gonna go
throw rocks at cars later on,

101
00:03:39,769 --> 00:03:40,767
And we thought maybe
you'd like to join us.

102
00:03:40,802 --> 00:03:43,234
Really, i've never
done that before.

103
00:03:43,269 --> 00:03:44,332
It's really fun!

104
00:03:44,367 --> 00:03:45,699
You toss these
little rocks at cars,

105
00:03:45,734 --> 00:03:47,267
And if the driver
gets angry, you blame me!

106
00:03:47,302 --> 00:03:48,199
Yeah, it's cool.

107
00:03:48,234 --> 00:03:50,732
Well sure, that
sounds hella fun.

108
00:03:50,767 --> 00:03:53,601
Ha, ha! Yeah!She's right! Hella-Fun!

109
00:03:53,636 --> 00:03:55,265
"Hella-Fun"
that's awesome.

110
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:57,300
I'm gonna start
saying that now!

111
00:03:57,335 --> 00:03:59,300
Cool, we'll
see you later, bebe.

112
00:03:59,335 --> 00:04:00,466
Stan, you've
never asked me

113
00:04:00,501 --> 00:04:01,699
To throw rocks at cars
with you guys.

114
00:04:01,734 --> 00:04:04,400
That's different, dude,
you're like my girlfriend.

115
00:04:04,435 --> 00:04:07,100
Bebe's just- I dunno
she's just... cool.

116
00:04:07,135 --> 00:04:08,499
Yeah, she's really cool.

117
00:04:08,534 --> 00:04:11,534
It's weird how we
never noticed before.

118
00:04:14,033 --> 00:04:15,065
So what you do, see, is

119
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:16,634
You wait for a car to
drive by that big pine tree,

120
00:04:16,669 --> 00:04:18,051
Then you chuck
a rock at it.

121
00:04:18,086 --> 00:04:19,434
It's all about
the timing...

122
00:04:20,267 --> 00:04:21,501
You damn kids!

123
00:04:21,536 --> 00:04:22,466
Cool!

124
00:04:22,501 --> 00:04:23,884
You try it, bebe!
Okay!

125
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:25,267
Here comes a sedan!

126
00:04:28,501 --> 00:04:29,299
You damn kids!

127
00:04:29,334 --> 00:04:31,566
Sweet!Cool!
Awesome!

128
00:04:31,601 --> 00:04:33,334
Wow, that was the most perfect
throw i've ever seen!

129
00:04:33,369 --> 00:04:34,532
That was sweet, bebe!

130
00:04:34,567 --> 00:04:36,133
Now if you just hold
the rock like this-

131
00:04:36,168 --> 00:04:36,899
Yeah, here, it's like,

132
00:04:36,934 --> 00:04:37,567
If you put your thumb
on this side-

133
00:04:37,602 --> 00:04:39,632
I'm showing her.

134
00:04:39,667 --> 00:04:41,400
Yeah, just let me show her
real quick how to put the thumb-

135
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:46,917
Anyways, you put a spin
on it by holding it here-

136
00:04:46,952 --> 00:04:48,634
Yeah, and then you can
actually hold it like this-

137
00:04:55,667 --> 00:04:56,467
Listen, guys, uh,
it's five-Thirty.

138
00:04:56,502 --> 00:04:58,251
I'm supposed to get home.

139
00:04:58,286 --> 00:05:00,000
So... i'll see you later.

140
00:05:04,267 --> 00:05:05,884
Wait- What were
we doing again?

141
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:07,501
We were throwing
rocks at cars.

142
00:05:07,536 --> 00:05:09,318
Right.Rocks.
Oh yeah.

143
00:05:09,353 --> 00:05:11,100
Here comes a suv!

144
00:05:11,734 --> 00:05:13,868
You damn kids!

145
00:05:17,467 --> 00:05:18,899
Hi, bebe!

146
00:05:18,934 --> 00:05:19,666
Hey, everybody!

147
00:05:19,701 --> 00:05:20,965
Oh for christ's sake!

148
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,767
M'kay, kids, yesterday
i asked you to write a paper

149
00:05:24,802 --> 00:05:27,067
To read aloud
for the class.

150
00:05:27,102 --> 00:05:30,133
Now who wants to start?

151
00:05:30,168 --> 00:05:31,566
M'kay, clyde.

152
00:05:31,601 --> 00:05:32,799
My paper is called,

153
00:05:32,834 --> 00:05:34,934
"Why bebe is the
coolest person ever."

154
00:05:34,969 --> 00:05:36,400
Hey, that's what
i wrote about!

155
00:05:36,435 --> 00:05:37,501
Me too!

156
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:44,399
Umm'k,
go ahead, clyde.

157
00:05:44,434 --> 00:05:47,666
My friend bebe
is really smart.

158
00:05:47,701 --> 00:05:50,667
She tells funny jokes
and knows a lot about stuff.

159
00:05:50,702 --> 00:05:53,234
She's good at almost
everything she tries.

160
00:05:53,269 --> 00:05:55,400
She's awesome, the end.

161
00:05:57,801 --> 00:06:00,432
M'kay,
very nice, clyde.

162
00:06:00,467 --> 00:06:03,100
Uh, token, why don't you
read your paper.

163
00:06:03,135 --> 00:06:05,332
"If i could be bebe"

164
00:06:05,367 --> 00:06:08,300
If i was bebe i would have
lots of friends

165
00:06:08,335 --> 00:06:09,799
Because i would
be so great.

166
00:06:09,834 --> 00:06:14,601
I would make people smile
and think wherever i went.

167
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:17,483
M'kay, interesting, token.

168
00:06:17,518 --> 00:06:19,732
Who would like to go next?

169
00:06:19,767 --> 00:06:26,167
Uh, how about someone who didn't
write about how cool bebe is?

170
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:29,383
M'kay, bebe.

171
00:06:29,418 --> 00:06:31,042
"My cat thumper"

172
00:06:31,077 --> 00:06:32,632
Wow!
Wow!Wow!

173
00:06:32,667 --> 00:06:34,500
Thumper is grey
with a white spot.

174
00:06:34,535 --> 00:06:36,334
Sometimes, he likes to
chase his tail.

175
00:06:38,868 --> 00:06:40,734
Chase his tail!
That must be so funny!

176
00:06:40,769 --> 00:06:42,484
Thumper is
12 years old.

177
00:06:42,519 --> 00:06:44,200
That's pretty old
for a cat.

178
00:06:44,235 --> 00:06:45,165
The end.

179
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:47,199
Wow!
Wow!Wow!

180
00:06:47,234 --> 00:06:48,632
God, you know,
that's so true,

181
00:06:48,667 --> 00:06:50,267
Because you sometimes
never really think about

182
00:06:50,302 --> 00:06:51,267
How old a pet is,
until it's gone.

183
00:06:51,302 --> 00:06:53,032
That's true, huh?

184
00:06:53,067 --> 00:06:55,234
Man, that really makes me
reflect on my pets.

185
00:06:55,269 --> 00:06:58,434
<i>That's such
a great paper.</i>

186
00:07:00,701 --> 00:07:03,334
M'kay, wendy, why don't
we hear your paper?

187
00:07:03,369 --> 00:07:04,666
"The new cold war"-

188
00:07:04,701 --> 00:07:05,300
Oh god, here
we go again.

189
00:07:05,335 --> 00:07:06,334
Dork alert!

190
00:07:09,501 --> 00:07:11,634
But then the mall closes
at four or five o'clock so-

191
00:07:11,669 --> 00:07:13,767
Hey, have you dumb girls
seen bebe anywhere?

192
00:07:13,802 --> 00:07:14,532
No!

193
00:07:14,567 --> 00:07:15,968
Maybe she's in
the lunch line.

194
00:07:16,003 --> 00:07:17,766
Yeah!
Yeah!

195
00:07:17,801 --> 00:07:19,033
Can you believe bebe? She thinks
she so cool all of a sudden!

196
00:07:19,068 --> 00:07:21,901
I can't stand her anymore,
she's such a slut.

197
00:07:21,936 --> 00:07:22,866
She's a total slut!

198
00:07:22,901 --> 00:07:24,600
You know what i heard?
I heard that she made out

199
00:07:24,635 --> 00:07:26,300
<i>With eight different boys
in one minute!</i>

200
00:07:26,335 --> 00:07:28,100
I heard that she
lifted her shirt

201
00:07:28,135 --> 00:07:29,065
To the boys
at the bus stop.

202
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:31,868
I heard that her asshole
is like this big around.

203
00:07:31,903 --> 00:07:32,918
Whoa!
Whoa!

204
00:07:32,953 --> 00:07:33,899
Hey, guys.

205
00:07:33,934 --> 00:07:35,483
Oh, hey, bebe-
Slut.

206
00:07:35,518 --> 00:07:36,998
Slut! Slut! Slut!

207
00:07:37,033 --> 00:07:40,601
You guys still wanna go
ice skating after school?

208
00:07:40,636 --> 00:07:41,766
No, that's okay, bebe.

209
00:07:41,801 --> 00:07:43,833
You might trip and then
we'd be sucked into

210
00:07:43,868 --> 00:07:46,734
Your huge, gaping vagina like
ants into a vacuum cleaner.

211
00:07:46,769 --> 00:07:47,685
Slut!

212
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:48,566
Slut!

213
00:07:48,601 --> 00:07:49,784
Slut!

214
00:07:49,819 --> 00:07:50,968
Slut!

215
00:07:59,701 --> 00:08:02,365
Bebe, is something
the matter?

216
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:06,033
Oh mom... it's just...
my girlfriends at school

217
00:08:06,068 --> 00:08:07,799
Said some really mean
things to me today.

218
00:08:07,834 --> 00:08:11,501
They called me a slut
with a huge, gaping vagina.

219
00:08:11,536 --> 00:08:14,833
Oh, sweetie, you're
all just growing up.

220
00:08:14,868 --> 00:08:17,167
Part of being a woman
is having a friend one day,

221
00:08:17,202 --> 00:08:18,601
And calling her
a slut the next.

222
00:08:18,636 --> 00:08:19,965
But am i slutty
just because

223
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,632
I'm starting to be
friends with guys?

224
00:08:21,667 --> 00:08:23,334
They just like me because
they think i'm smart and cool.

225
00:08:23,369 --> 00:08:25,632
I remember when
i was a little girl,

226
00:08:25,667 --> 00:08:28,300
The boys didn't think
i was very smart at all.

227
00:08:28,335 --> 00:08:29,599
But then, one day-

228
00:08:29,634 --> 00:08:32,383
They all started thinking
i was really smart.

229
00:08:32,418 --> 00:08:35,098
I guess big smarts
just run in our family.

230
00:08:35,133 --> 00:08:37,567
Well if the girls don't want to
be my friends, that's fine.

231
00:08:37,602 --> 00:08:39,200
Guys are way
cooler anyways.

232
00:08:41,334 --> 00:08:43,532
You guys wanted me
to meet you here?

233
00:08:43,567 --> 00:08:45,200
Yeah, have a seat, tweek,
we all need to have a talk.

234
00:08:45,235 --> 00:08:47,065
Oh god!

235
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:48,599
Alright, guys, now that
we're all here

236
00:08:48,634 --> 00:08:51,200
I think that we need to have
a difficult conversation.

237
00:08:51,235 --> 00:08:53,767
It's obvious that bebe is
like the coolest, smartest,

238
00:08:53,802 --> 00:08:55,467
Most awesome person
we've ever met.

239
00:08:55,502 --> 00:08:56,632
True.
Yup.

240
00:08:56,667 --> 00:08:58,833
And, y'know we've been
trying to fill the gap

241
00:08:58,868 --> 00:09:01,000
With a fourth friend
ever since kenny died,

242
00:09:01,035 --> 00:09:01,899
God rest his soul...

243
00:09:01,934 --> 00:09:04,200
And it hasn't been
an easy process.

244
00:09:04,235 --> 00:09:05,732
Right...

245
00:09:05,767 --> 00:09:07,968
And so, even though i think it's
a tough thing to do right now...

246
00:09:08,003 --> 00:09:09,334
I think maybe it's best
for everyone if we make room

247
00:09:09,369 --> 00:09:12,334
To allow bebe to be
our new fourth friend.

248
00:09:12,369 --> 00:09:14,632
Yeah, that
would be best.

249
00:09:14,667 --> 00:09:16,150
Well, i'm glad
you guys all agree.

250
00:09:16,185 --> 00:09:17,599
And so, kyle,
i just want to say that

251
00:09:17,634 --> 00:09:19,467
It's been really great,
and we're going to miss you.

252
00:09:19,502 --> 00:09:20,599
Huh?!
Kyle?

253
00:09:20,634 --> 00:09:21,998
And even though
it didn't quite work out,

254
00:09:22,033 --> 00:09:23,601
I'm sure you'll find other
friends the down the road, kyle.

255
00:09:23,636 --> 00:09:25,868
Here's a nice watch for you
and some peanuts.

256
00:09:25,903 --> 00:09:26,933
Me?!

257
00:09:26,968 --> 00:09:28,534
Dude, i've been here
since the beginning!

258
00:09:28,569 --> 00:09:29,866
And we're really
sad to see you go.

259
00:09:29,901 --> 00:09:31,267
Let's give a big round of
applause for kyle, everybody.

260
00:09:31,302 --> 00:09:32,299
Hip, hip!

261
00:09:32,334 --> 00:09:34,434
Dude, we're not
kicking kyle out!

262
00:09:34,469 --> 00:09:36,167
Pleeeeeaaaaaaase?

263
00:09:36,202 --> 00:09:37,866
No!

264
00:09:37,901 --> 00:09:38,599
Alright, fine!

265
00:09:38,634 --> 00:09:40,334
Then i guess
we have no choice

266
00:09:40,369 --> 00:09:41,732
But to let
you go, tweek.

267
00:09:41,767 --> 00:09:43,467
But we want you to know
that it's been really fun.

268
00:09:43,502 --> 00:09:44,901
Here's a watch
and some peanuts.

269
00:09:44,936 --> 00:09:46,265
No way, tweek's cool! Yeah!

270
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:49,200
Well dumbasses, how are
we gonna make room for bebe?

271
00:09:51,033 --> 00:09:55,133
Thanks for inviting me to ride
the bus to school with you guys.

272
00:09:55,168 --> 00:09:56,201
Sure thing, bebe.

273
00:09:56,236 --> 00:09:57,251
That's fine!

274
00:09:57,286 --> 00:09:58,232
That's fine!

275
00:09:58,267 --> 00:10:00,267
F- K you, kyle!
F- K you, stan!

276
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:04,899
F- K you, tweek!

277
00:10:04,934 --> 00:10:08,000
Bebe, you're still cool.

278
00:10:14,534 --> 00:10:15,766
What are you doing?

279
00:10:15,801 --> 00:10:17,467
We're trying to get bebe
to run for class president!

280
00:10:17,502 --> 00:10:20,101
I'm class president!
The vote was last fall!

281
00:10:20,136 --> 00:10:22,666
Well, yeah, but, wendy,
you have to admit

282
00:10:22,701 --> 00:10:24,634
Bebe is a lot smarter and
more organized than you.

283
00:10:24,669 --> 00:10:26,501
Yeah, we need
a leader like bebe.

284
00:10:26,536 --> 00:10:28,334
She can teach us
all so much.

285
00:10:28,369 --> 00:10:30,365
Uh-Huh...

286
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:32,667
She's not smarter
and cooler than everyone!

287
00:10:32,702 --> 00:10:34,934
You guys are just drawn
to something else!

288
00:10:34,969 --> 00:10:36,466
What?

289
00:10:36,501 --> 00:10:40,934
My god, you guys
are so stupid!

290
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:43,433
Stupider
than bebe!

291
00:10:43,468 --> 00:10:44,432
Yeah!Yeah!
Yeah!

292
00:10:44,467 --> 00:10:46,650
Bebe's cool,
huh, fellas?

293
00:10:46,685 --> 00:10:48,834
Yup!Yeah!
She sure is.

294
00:10:51,133 --> 00:10:53,067
I can't wait to watch
terrance and phillip with bebe!

295
00:10:53,102 --> 00:10:54,132
Yeah!

296
00:10:54,167 --> 00:10:55,332
Where are
you guys going?

297
00:10:55,367 --> 00:10:58,200
We're going to see
our friend bebe.

298
00:10:58,235 --> 00:10:59,232
Bebe is our friend.

299
00:10:59,267 --> 00:11:00,683
Didn't you all
get the memo?

300
00:11:00,718 --> 00:11:02,065
Bebe is everybody's friend.

301
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:05,300
Yeah, god put bebe on earth
to enrich everyone's lives!

302
00:11:10,167 --> 00:11:12,100
Alright, i guess
we can all watch

303
00:11:12,135 --> 00:11:14,033
Terrance and phillip together.

304
00:11:14,267 --> 00:11:15,967
Oh hello, boys.

305
00:11:16,002 --> 00:11:17,632
Is bebe home?

306
00:11:17,667 --> 00:11:18,998
No, she's with
one of her little friends.

307
00:11:19,033 --> 00:11:21,300
But she should be back shortly
if you boys want to wait.

308
00:11:21,335 --> 00:11:22,466
Who is she with?

309
00:11:22,501 --> 00:11:23,450
I believe
she's playing "lambs"

310
00:11:23,485 --> 00:11:24,400
Over at eric cartman's house.

311
00:11:24,435 --> 00:11:27,566
Cartman's?!

312
00:11:27,601 --> 00:11:29,300
See, and
this is precious!

313
00:11:29,335 --> 00:11:29,998
Precious?

314
00:11:30,033 --> 00:11:31,332
Bark! Bark! Bark!

315
00:11:31,367 --> 00:11:32,200
Okay, so then we put
my mom's hand lotion

316
00:11:32,235 --> 00:11:32,998
In this little basket

317
00:11:33,033 --> 00:11:36,200
And lower it down
to polly prissypants.

318
00:11:36,235 --> 00:11:37,799
Uh-Huh...

319
00:11:37,834 --> 00:11:40,601
Now you say- "It puts the
lotion on its skin

320
00:11:40,636 --> 00:11:42,551
Or else it gets
the hose again."

321
00:11:42,586 --> 00:11:43,926
It... puts the
lotion on its skin

322
00:11:43,961 --> 00:11:45,267
Or else it gets
the hose again.

323
00:11:45,302 --> 00:11:47,499
Huh-Huh, yeah!

324
00:11:47,534 --> 00:11:48,434
Mister, please
let me out of here!

325
00:11:48,469 --> 00:11:50,365
Now say it
again, louder!

326
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:51,967
It puts the lotion
on its skin

327
00:11:52,002 --> 00:11:53,499
Or else it gets
the hose again.

328
00:11:53,534 --> 00:11:55,200
Good, now put the
lotion back in the basket.

329
00:11:55,235 --> 00:11:57,466
My parents have
money, mister!

330
00:11:57,501 --> 00:11:58,801
They'll give you
whatever you want!

331
00:11:58,836 --> 00:11:59,899
Please!

332
00:11:59,934 --> 00:12:01,467
Now just yell, "put the
lotion in the f-King basket!"

333
00:12:01,502 --> 00:12:02,466
Put the lotion
in the basket!

334
00:12:02,501 --> 00:12:04,501
Put the lotion
in the f-King basket!

335
00:12:04,536 --> 00:12:06,065
Oh no,
precious!

336
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:07,365
I got your dog mister,

337
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:08,532
Let me out or
i'm gonna kill it!

338
00:12:08,567 --> 00:12:10,834
You say- "Don't you
hurt my f-King dog"!

339
00:12:10,869 --> 00:12:12,351
Don't you hurt
my f-King dog!

340
00:12:12,386 --> 00:12:13,759
You bitch, i'll
cut your throat-

341
00:12:13,794 --> 00:12:15,133
What the hell
are you doing?

342
00:12:15,168 --> 00:12:17,432
We're playing lambs.

343
00:12:17,467 --> 00:12:20,434
Bebe, i thought we were gonna
watch terrance and phillip today.

344
00:12:20,469 --> 00:12:21,467
Yeah, and then we gotta
work on your campaign!

345
00:12:21,502 --> 00:12:23,400
Right, but first
we have to go to-

346
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:27,701
You guys, calm down!

347
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:37,399
This is insane!

348
00:12:37,434 --> 00:12:40,501
Stop it, you guys,
please!

349
00:12:53,601 --> 00:12:55,234
Oh boy, i never meant
to cause all this trouble!

350
00:12:57,133 --> 00:12:58,601
Arhhh! Ahrrrh!

351
00:13:04,133 --> 00:13:05,965
Bebe... those boys
from your school

352
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,501
Are still waiting outside
to see if you'll come out.

353
00:13:08,536 --> 00:13:11,467
I know, they've
been there all day.

354
00:13:35,167 --> 00:13:38,067
Looks like my little girl has
a lot of gentlemen callers!

355
00:13:38,102 --> 00:13:41,601
Mom, why is everyone acting
so different around me?

356
00:13:41,636 --> 00:13:44,000
Sweetie- You're just
blossoming into a woman.

357
00:13:44,035 --> 00:13:45,632
But... i don't know
if i want to.

358
00:13:45,667 --> 00:13:48,234
Sometimes i think that i'm not
as smart and cool as they say.

359
00:13:48,269 --> 00:13:50,534
That everyone just tells me
i am because of my hooters.

360
00:13:50,569 --> 00:13:51,466
Sweetie,
you're a stevens.

361
00:13:51,501 --> 00:13:53,684
And stevens women
are always told

362
00:13:53,719 --> 00:13:56,459
They're really,
really smart!

363
00:13:56,494 --> 00:13:59,165
Mom, what's
six times eight?

364
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:04,234
Oh sweetie... those are two
completely different numbers.

365
00:14:10,033 --> 00:14:11,566
Alright, boys,
time to be getting home.

366
00:14:11,601 --> 00:14:14,968
Bebe's not feeling well,
and she can't come out today.

367
00:14:15,003 --> 00:14:16,767
Go on- Shoo!

368
00:14:25,334 --> 00:14:27,566
Oh whew,
we made it!

369
00:14:27,601 --> 00:14:29,501
Boys, can you
call 911 for us?

370
00:14:32,234 --> 00:14:34,132
Oh my god!

371
00:14:34,167 --> 00:14:36,200
We've landed on earth
thousands of years in the future

372
00:14:36,235 --> 00:14:37,466
And apes have taken over!

373
00:14:37,501 --> 00:14:38,833
I knew it
- You blew it up, didn't you?!

374
00:14:38,868 --> 00:14:41,801
I don't want to live
in this futuristic madness!

375
00:14:42,567 --> 00:14:44,234
Take your ape world
and go to hell!

376
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:48,701
Having boobs sucks.

377
00:14:51,467 --> 00:14:52,601
Well, hello there,
little girl,

378
00:14:52,636 --> 00:14:53,766
My name is doctor hallis,

379
00:14:53,801 --> 00:14:55,065
What can i
do for you today?

380
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:58,601
I want to have
breast reduction surgery.

381
00:15:01,234 --> 00:15:02,265
You?

382
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:04,234
Yes, i have
$212 in nickels

383
00:15:04,269 --> 00:15:05,965
And a gold bracelet.

384
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,833
Well, young lady,
i'm afraid that we don't

385
00:15:08,868 --> 00:15:12,133
Offer breast reduction surgery
to girls of your age.

386
00:15:12,168 --> 00:15:13,199
Why not?

387
00:15:13,234 --> 00:15:14,901
Britney spears got fake ones
when she was a teenager,

388
00:15:14,936 --> 00:15:16,385
Why can't i have
mine taken off?

389
00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:17,799
Because making breasts larger

390
00:15:17,834 --> 00:15:19,433
Is a beautiful
and wonderful thing.

391
00:15:19,468 --> 00:15:20,998
Making them smaller is...
insane.

392
00:15:21,033 --> 00:15:23,701
I think it's insane
to want them bigger!

393
00:15:23,736 --> 00:15:25,802
Why do you
hate your breasts so?

394
00:15:25,837 --> 00:15:27,418
Ever since i got
these stupid things

395
00:15:27,453 --> 00:15:28,965
Everyone treats
me differently!

396
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,467
I feel like i might be
treated differently

397
00:15:30,502 --> 00:15:31,632
The rest of my life!

398
00:15:31,667 --> 00:15:33,667
Oh come on now,
that's just silly.

399
00:15:33,702 --> 00:15:35,632
Here's the
anderson file, doctor.

400
00:15:35,667 --> 00:15:38,033
Oh awesome, thank you so much,
jilian that's great.

401
00:15:38,068 --> 00:15:42,067
Ooh god damn,
thank you so much...

402
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,934
And here's the coffee
you wanted, doctor.

403
00:15:44,969 --> 00:15:47,200
Yeah, whatever,
get out of here.

404
00:15:47,235 --> 00:15:49,332
Now, i was saying?

405
00:15:49,367 --> 00:15:50,599
Please, you
have to help me!

406
00:15:50,634 --> 00:15:52,634
I think that if my breasts
keep growing this way,

407
00:15:52,669 --> 00:15:54,418
Boys will give me
whatever i want!

408
00:15:54,453 --> 00:15:56,167
Yeah, so,
that's great, isn't it?

409
00:15:56,202 --> 00:15:57,199
No, it's not!

410
00:15:57,234 --> 00:15:58,965
Because if i grow up
getting everything i want-

411
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,667
Having things made easy for me
because i have hot knockers

412
00:16:00,702 --> 00:16:02,901
Then i'm going to grow up
to be a lame person.

413
00:16:02,936 --> 00:16:04,251
If i'm handed
everything in life

414
00:16:04,286 --> 00:16:05,659
Then my chances
of becoming a lawyer

415
00:16:05,694 --> 00:16:06,998
Or a marine biologist
are zero!

416
00:16:07,033 --> 00:16:09,216
That may be true,
but i'm afraid i just cannot

417
00:16:09,251 --> 00:16:11,400
Ethically perform
a breast reduction surgery

418
00:16:11,435 --> 00:16:12,934
On an eight-Year-Old girl!

419
00:16:12,969 --> 00:16:13,699
Dammit!

420
00:16:13,734 --> 00:16:14,799
If, on the other hand

421
00:16:14,834 --> 00:16:16,098
You'd like to make them
a little bigger,

422
00:16:16,133 --> 00:16:18,167
I think now might be
the right time to size up, mmm?

423
00:16:18,202 --> 00:16:20,467
Oh, f-K off!

424
00:16:21,667 --> 00:16:23,400
Randy, could you have
a talk with stanly?

425
00:16:23,435 --> 00:16:24,901
What's the matter with him?

426
00:16:24,936 --> 00:16:25,933
It's just that...

427
00:16:25,968 --> 00:16:27,968
Well, he's been acting
a little different.

428
00:16:28,003 --> 00:16:31,032
Ahhh-Tah, ahhhh-Tah.

429
00:16:31,067 --> 00:16:35,734
He's been ignoring his homework
and all his friends.

430
00:16:35,769 --> 00:16:37,234
I can't figure out why.

431
00:16:37,269 --> 00:16:41,599
Atahhh...

432
00:16:41,634 --> 00:16:44,500
Oh boy, it looks like he's
starting to notice breasts.

433
00:16:44,535 --> 00:16:47,367
Oh yes, our little stanly
is starting to become a man.

434
00:16:47,402 --> 00:16:51,534
Atahh, ohhhhh,
ahhhtahhh!

435
00:16:51,569 --> 00:16:52,734
Hey there, son.

436
00:16:52,769 --> 00:16:54,032
Wah!?

437
00:16:54,067 --> 00:16:55,434
Ahh-Tah... ah-Tahh...

438
00:16:55,469 --> 00:16:57,098
Yes, ah-Tahh.

439
00:16:57,133 --> 00:16:58,334
Let's have a talk, stan.

440
00:16:58,369 --> 00:17:00,466
Tah-Halk!

441
00:17:00,501 --> 00:17:03,250
Stan, as you get older,
boobs- These atahh-

442
00:17:03,285 --> 00:17:05,965
Will start becoming
a major part of your life.

443
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:11,267
But stanly, you can't let them
get in the way of your friends.

444
00:17:11,302 --> 00:17:12,300
There are lots of
boobs out there, son.

445
00:17:12,335 --> 00:17:13,817
But they're just boobs.

446
00:17:13,852 --> 00:17:15,300
Your friends are forever.

447
00:17:15,335 --> 00:17:18,065
Friends... atahh...

448
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:21,065
I know you think this set
of boobs is important now,

449
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:23,267
But those boobs will be replaced
by another set of boobs.

450
00:17:23,302 --> 00:17:25,466
Boobs will come and go.

451
00:17:25,501 --> 00:17:27,667
And then someday, you'll
meet a pair of boobs

452
00:17:27,702 --> 00:17:28,833
That you want to marry.

453
00:17:28,868 --> 00:17:31,801
And those become the boobs
that matter the most.

454
00:17:31,836 --> 00:17:32,732
I love you.

455
00:17:32,767 --> 00:17:34,666
If you can just
understand that, stanly

456
00:17:34,701 --> 00:17:38,901
You'll see that boobs
hold no real power at all.

457
00:17:48,467 --> 00:17:49,699
The boys are at war.

458
00:17:49,734 --> 00:17:51,050
All is going
as planned.

459
00:17:51,085 --> 00:17:52,609
Yessss... soon
all the boys

460
00:17:52,644 --> 00:17:54,122
Will be brought
to their knees.

461
00:17:54,157 --> 00:17:55,601
We grow larger
every day...

462
00:17:55,636 --> 00:17:56,766
And stronger...

463
00:17:56,801 --> 00:17:58,000
Soon, the
entire town-

464
00:17:58,035 --> 00:17:59,200
Shh, shh,
she's awake!

465
00:17:59,235 --> 00:17:59,899
Oh, quiet!

466
00:17:59,934 --> 00:18:02,467
Aaaghhaghgh!
Mom, mommmmmmm!

467
00:18:02,502 --> 00:18:03,934
What is it, bebe?

468
00:18:03,969 --> 00:18:04,933
My breasts!

469
00:18:04,968 --> 00:18:07,200
Oh sweetheart, you're
just becoming a young lady.

470
00:18:07,235 --> 00:18:08,632
No, they're conspiring!

471
00:18:08,667 --> 00:18:10,234
Mom, they were talking,
they want to destroy the town!

472
00:18:10,269 --> 00:18:13,101
Yes, darling, your
breasts have a power

473
00:18:13,136 --> 00:18:15,934
That will unleash
itself as you get older.

474
00:18:15,969 --> 00:18:17,699
They feed off
the misery of boys,

475
00:18:17,734 --> 00:18:19,601
And grow to bring woe
wherever they can.

476
00:18:19,636 --> 00:18:21,300
You're blossoming
into a woman.

477
00:18:21,335 --> 00:18:23,032
That does it!

478
00:18:23,067 --> 00:18:25,467
I'm not letting
these things run my life!

479
00:18:30,334 --> 00:18:31,998
Young lady, are you
absolutely sure

480
00:18:32,033 --> 00:18:36,234
You want to consider this kind
of procedure for your breasts?

481
00:18:36,269 --> 00:18:38,251
Yes, i want to get
breast implants.

482
00:18:38,286 --> 00:18:40,199
I tried to tell her
she was too young.

483
00:18:40,234 --> 00:18:42,700
Well, it is a different time,
mrs. Testaburger.

484
00:18:42,735 --> 00:18:45,167
Society puts a lot of
pressure on your daughter

485
00:18:45,202 --> 00:18:46,199
To look her best.

486
00:18:46,234 --> 00:18:48,701
Having small breasts can
make her feel unimportant.

487
00:18:48,736 --> 00:18:51,299
<i>But she's eight!</i>

488
00:18:51,334 --> 00:18:53,467
Yes, well, not too
young to feel flat

489
00:18:53,502 --> 00:18:54,701
And therefore not pretty.

490
00:18:54,736 --> 00:18:55,899
That's what i said.

491
00:18:55,934 --> 00:18:58,033
However, young lady,
i'm afraid breast implants

492
00:18:58,068 --> 00:18:58,732
Are not for everyone.

493
00:18:58,767 --> 00:19:00,532
I'll need to
carefully assess

494
00:19:00,567 --> 00:19:01,933
Your physical
and mental condition

495
00:19:01,968 --> 00:19:05,067
To see if augmentation is truly
the best way for you to go.

496
00:19:05,102 --> 00:19:06,799
I have $3,000 cash.

497
00:19:06,834 --> 00:19:08,299
You pass,
let's do this thing.

498
00:19:08,334 --> 00:19:09,666
Ooh, wait- You're
gonna do it right now?

499
00:19:09,701 --> 00:19:12,667
Sure, breast augmentation
is now a very simple procedure.

500
00:19:12,702 --> 00:19:14,300
What we do is make a small
incision in the armpit,

501
00:19:14,335 --> 00:19:16,365
Where it won't be seen.

502
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:18,100
Then we take this
little plastic bag

503
00:19:18,135 --> 00:19:19,801
And gently place it
in the chest,

504
00:19:19,836 --> 00:19:21,468
Where we fill it
with salt water.

505
00:19:21,503 --> 00:19:23,065
I still don't
know about this.

506
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:26,234
Look, us plastic surgeons
have one philosophy:

507
00:19:26,269 --> 00:19:28,968
If we can help
someone's self-Esteem

508
00:19:29,003 --> 00:19:31,667
Then why not do it
if they have $3,000.

509
00:19:40,767 --> 00:19:44,234
Just... gotta jam it
up there!

510
00:19:44,269 --> 00:19:47,251
Get-In-There-You-Bitch!

511
00:19:47,286 --> 00:19:50,234
Get-In-There-You-Bitch!

512
00:19:51,734 --> 00:19:55,133
Ahhh, okay, there's one,
wendy, doing great...!

513
00:19:56,901 --> 00:20:00,434
M'kay, kids, we need to
talk about your failing grades.

514
00:20:00,469 --> 00:20:03,666
Bebe... where bebe?

515
00:20:03,701 --> 00:20:05,998
Bebe!Ah-Tah!
Fire bad!

516
00:20:06,033 --> 00:20:10,067
Okay, we all have to start
studying more

517
00:20:10,102 --> 00:20:12,301
And fighting less, m'kay?

518
00:20:12,336 --> 00:20:14,501
Ah-Tah!
Bebe!Fire bad!

519
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:17,599
Hey, guys.

520
00:20:17,634 --> 00:20:19,834
Hmmm... nnnnnmmm...

521
00:20:26,033 --> 00:20:26,799
Have you guys
noticed that

522
00:20:26,834 --> 00:20:29,267
Bebe isn't as cool
as she used to be?

523
00:20:29,302 --> 00:20:31,701
Yeah, what the hell
happened to us?

524
00:20:31,736 --> 00:20:33,802
Oh my god,
i get it now!

525
00:20:33,837 --> 00:20:35,868
It was bebe's boobs!

526
00:20:35,903 --> 00:20:36,965
Bebe's boobs?

527
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,217
Oh cool, it worked!

528
00:20:38,252 --> 00:20:39,399
Don't you guys see?

529
00:20:39,434 --> 00:20:41,050
Boobs do something
to our brains.

530
00:20:41,085 --> 00:20:43,409
They fill our brains
with illusions.

531
00:20:43,444 --> 00:20:45,734
So, bebe didn't become
smart and cool,

532
00:20:45,769 --> 00:20:46,234
It was just her boobs?

533
00:20:46,269 --> 00:20:48,132
Yes!

534
00:20:48,167 --> 00:20:51,434
So bebe's is actually just
as lame as she ever was?

535
00:20:51,469 --> 00:20:53,367
Right, my boobs just
clouded your judgement.

536
00:20:53,402 --> 00:20:55,232
But that sucks.

537
00:20:55,267 --> 00:20:57,033
I don't want something to have
that much power over me.

538
00:20:57,068 --> 00:20:59,134
I don't think it will
as long as we realize it.

539
00:20:59,169 --> 00:21:01,200
We must learn to control
their power over us.

540
00:21:01,235 --> 00:21:03,201
Yeah, screw boobs,
they're stupid!

541
00:21:03,236 --> 00:21:05,167
I'm sorry for
fighting, you guys.

542
00:21:05,202 --> 00:21:07,133
Dude, sorry.I'm sorry.
Aww.

543
00:21:09,267 --> 00:21:11,032
Oh, that's so sweet.

544
00:21:11,067 --> 00:21:13,434
Let's never let boobs
come between us again!

545
00:21:13,469 --> 00:21:14,332
Here, here!

546
00:21:14,367 --> 00:21:16,267
Boobs are stupid!

547
00:21:16,302 --> 00:21:18,167
Hi, everybody!

548
00:21:21,334 --> 00:21:23,532
Ha ha!Ha ha!
Ha ha!

549
00:21:23,567 --> 00:21:26,084
Look at those
ridiculous things!

550
00:21:26,119 --> 00:21:28,601
Eww... they're all
hard and oogy!

551
00:21:28,636 --> 00:21:30,384
What a stupid bitch!

552
00:21:30,419 --> 00:21:32,133
Ha ha!Ha ha!
Ha ha!



9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
