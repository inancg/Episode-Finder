14
00:00:40,267 --> 00:00:41,534
Be careful
with my baby!

15
00:00:41,569 --> 00:00:42,599
What have we got?

16
00:00:42,634 --> 00:00:44,434
Not sure- Looks like
a possible code 56!

17
00:00:44,469 --> 00:00:46,232
Kenny...
shut up, kenny!

18
00:00:46,267 --> 00:00:48,601
You're going to
be okay, baby...

19
00:00:49,634 --> 00:00:51,450
Get me 50 ccs
of ketamine stat!

20
00:00:51,485 --> 00:00:53,267
And get something
for the kid too!

21
00:00:53,302 --> 00:00:54,265
Is he going to
be okay?

22
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:56,801
Let the doctor
do his work, ma'am.

23
00:01:02,934 --> 00:01:03,766
Doctor!

24
00:01:03,801 --> 00:01:04,501
Did you find out
what's wrong with him?

25
00:01:04,536 --> 00:01:06,284
I'm afraid he's...

26
00:01:06,319 --> 00:01:07,998
Running out
of time.

27
00:01:08,033 --> 00:01:09,232
Why, what's
wrong with him?

28
00:01:09,267 --> 00:01:12,334
It's his time,
it's running out.

29
00:01:12,369 --> 00:01:14,668
Well, what
does he need?

30
00:01:14,703 --> 00:01:16,968
He needs to have
more time.

31
00:01:17,003 --> 00:01:18,566
What can we do?

32
00:01:18,601 --> 00:01:21,400
Well, i suppose we could
try a time transplant...

33
00:01:21,435 --> 00:01:22,300
I'll have to call in
a specialist.

34
00:01:22,335 --> 00:01:24,299
It's going to be
okay, baby.

35
00:01:24,334 --> 00:01:26,234
We're going to
get you more time.

36
00:01:26,269 --> 00:01:29,634
Kenny!
Goddamn you kenny!

37
00:01:31,767 --> 00:01:33,199
Hello there, children!

38
00:01:33,234 --> 00:01:34,701
Chef, cartman is
in the hospital.

39
00:01:34,736 --> 00:01:35,965
They think
he might die.

40
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,267
Yeah, and we don't know
whether or not we should care.

41
00:01:38,302 --> 00:01:39,568
Well, what's
wrong with him?

42
00:01:39,603 --> 00:01:40,799
Well, nobody
seems to know.

43
00:01:40,834 --> 00:01:42,234
But we think it's because
he drank kenny's soul

44
00:01:42,269 --> 00:01:43,132
Four weeks ago.

45
00:01:43,167 --> 00:01:44,265
Kenny's ashes
were in an urn

46
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:46,300
And cartman drank it thinking
it was chocolate milk mix.

47
00:01:46,335 --> 00:01:47,566
Children!

48
00:01:47,601 --> 00:01:49,032
Why didn't you tell me
about this sooner?

49
00:01:49,067 --> 00:01:51,601
Like we said, we didn't know
whether or not we should care.

50
00:01:51,636 --> 00:01:52,899
Well you should!

51
00:01:52,934 --> 00:01:55,100
Cartman is your friend
whether you like him or not!

52
00:01:55,135 --> 00:01:57,667
Now come on, we gotta
get to that hospital!

53
00:01:57,702 --> 00:01:59,032
He's looking
a little better today.

54
00:01:59,067 --> 00:02:01,717
Yes, but his time
is still getting weaker.

55
00:02:01,752 --> 00:02:04,367
It will give out soon
unless we do something.

56
00:02:04,402 --> 00:02:07,300
Hey guys!
How's it going?

57
00:02:07,335 --> 00:02:09,032
Cartman?

58
00:02:09,067 --> 00:02:09,933
No, that's kenny.

59
00:02:09,968 --> 00:02:11,167
What the hell are
you assholes doing here?

60
00:02:11,202 --> 00:02:13,384
That's cartman.

61
00:02:13,419 --> 00:02:15,532
Oh my god, eric

62
00:02:15,567 --> 00:02:17,434
How long have you been
channeling kenny?

63
00:02:17,469 --> 00:02:18,466
Oh, about a month.

64
00:02:18,501 --> 00:02:20,167
Let's not validate
his delusions.

65
00:02:20,202 --> 00:02:21,365
Kenny?

66
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:23,300
Kenny do you know
what you need to get free?

67
00:02:23,335 --> 00:02:25,032
He's gone again.

68
00:02:25,067 --> 00:02:27,434
Ms. Cartman, we need to
get eric to a medium

69
00:02:27,469 --> 00:02:29,801
Who can speak with people
who have crossed over.

70
00:02:29,836 --> 00:02:30,998
What!
That's preposterous!

71
00:02:31,033 --> 00:02:33,183
What this child needs
is a time transplant!

72
00:02:33,218 --> 00:02:35,276
This hospital isn't
gonna do him any good!

73
00:02:35,311 --> 00:02:37,334
We need to take him
to see john edward.

74
00:02:37,369 --> 00:02:38,399
Hey, i've
seen that guy!

75
00:02:38,434 --> 00:02:39,534
He has a tv show where
he brings people on

76
00:02:39,569 --> 00:02:41,067
And talks to
their dead relatives!

77
00:02:41,102 --> 00:02:41,899
That's right.

78
00:02:41,934 --> 00:02:43,167
We have to go see him
in new york!

79
00:02:43,202 --> 00:02:44,098
I warn you, ms. Cartman,

80
00:02:44,133 --> 00:02:45,666
Your son's time could
give out at any minute.

81
00:02:45,701 --> 00:02:48,400
He needs to be kept here where
his time can be monitored!

82
00:02:48,435 --> 00:02:49,632
Oh what should i do!

83
00:02:49,667 --> 00:02:51,766
I'm playing roulette
with my child's life!

84
00:02:51,801 --> 00:02:53,868
Ooh, wait, "hairspray" is
showing in new york isn't it?

85
00:02:53,903 --> 00:02:54,699
Let's go there!

86
00:02:54,734 --> 00:02:56,132
Good! You children
need to come to.

87
00:02:56,167 --> 00:02:58,834
Eric needs all the support
he can get right now.

88
00:02:58,869 --> 00:02:59,899
We're going
to new york?

89
00:02:59,934 --> 00:03:03,265
Welcome aboard
flight 673 to new york.

90
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:05,601
We are happy to show you a
feature film during the flight.

91
00:03:05,636 --> 00:03:07,634
In a moment, we will
be showing a preview.

92
00:03:07,669 --> 00:03:09,267
Oh cool, we get
to watch a movie?

93
00:03:09,302 --> 00:03:10,265
Awesome!

94
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:13,467
Rob schneider
was an animal!

95
00:03:13,502 --> 00:03:15,732
Then he was a woman!

96
00:03:15,767 --> 00:03:17,300
And now
rob schneider is...

97
00:03:17,335 --> 00:03:19,499
A stapler!

98
00:03:19,534 --> 00:03:21,917
And he's about to
find out

99
00:03:21,952 --> 00:03:24,926
That being a stapler...

100
00:03:24,961 --> 00:03:27,866
Is harder than it looks!

101
00:03:27,901 --> 00:03:32,400
Rob schneider is
"the stapler" rated pg-13!

102
00:03:32,435 --> 00:03:33,651
Weak.Weak.

103
00:03:33,686 --> 00:03:34,833
Heh-Heh!

104
00:03:34,868 --> 00:03:37,701
That was kenny
laughing, not me!

105
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:41,283
This must be
the place.

106
00:03:41,318 --> 00:03:42,432
Okay, audience members, hi.

107
00:03:42,467 --> 00:03:44,050
Welcome to the
taping of the show.

108
00:03:44,085 --> 00:03:45,599
It's all general
seating in there,

109
00:03:45,634 --> 00:03:47,484
And just remember, mr. Edward
might not hear from

110
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:49,334
The particular dead person
you want to talk to.

111
00:03:49,369 --> 00:03:51,666
So just keep
an open mind.

112
00:03:51,701 --> 00:03:54,801
Don't worry, eric, i'm sure
he'll be able to help you!

113
00:03:55,634 --> 00:03:58,367
Ladies and gentlemen,
john edward.

114
00:04:00,167 --> 00:04:01,800
Thank you... thank you...

115
00:04:01,835 --> 00:04:04,467
Alright,
let's get started.

116
00:04:04,502 --> 00:04:07,065
It's coming from over here...

117
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:10,334
Does the name mike
mean anything to anybody?

118
00:04:10,369 --> 00:04:13,167
I'm getting mike-
Definitely an m...

119
00:04:13,202 --> 00:04:14,432
Maybe matt.

120
00:04:14,467 --> 00:04:16,950
Mike- Matt- Mary.

121
00:04:16,985 --> 00:04:19,399
Mary was
my mother!

122
00:04:19,434 --> 00:04:21,934
Okay, okay,
and she died?

123
00:04:21,969 --> 00:04:23,965
Yes, yes she did!

124
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,133
Okay and she's telling me
something about the money?

125
00:04:25,168 --> 00:04:27,367
"The money is safe"
is that making sense?

126
00:04:27,402 --> 00:04:30,098
Hmmm, not really.

127
00:04:30,133 --> 00:04:32,267
It must be from somewhere else
in the audience then.

128
00:04:32,302 --> 00:04:33,232
The money-

129
00:04:33,267 --> 00:04:34,200
Uh, over here, please.

130
00:04:34,235 --> 00:04:35,098
We have
a dead friend.

131
00:04:35,133 --> 00:04:36,732
Quiet down, boys, it doesn't
work that way...

132
00:04:36,767 --> 00:04:41,133
Uh... uh, okay i'm getting
someone now who's name is

133
00:04:41,168 --> 00:04:45,067
J... t... l... m... k...

134
00:04:45,102 --> 00:04:45,866
Kenny!

135
00:04:45,901 --> 00:04:47,132
Kenny says hi.

136
00:04:47,167 --> 00:04:48,632
Woaaaaa!

137
00:04:48,667 --> 00:04:51,067
Okay, now i'm getting
that kenny died?

138
00:04:51,102 --> 00:04:51,899
We told you that.

139
00:04:51,934 --> 00:04:53,417
And it wasn't
a good death.

140
00:04:53,452 --> 00:04:54,866
It was,
it was a sad death.

141
00:04:54,901 --> 00:04:57,067
It was like, a death
that made people sad

142
00:04:57,102 --> 00:04:58,167
Does that make sense?

143
00:04:58,202 --> 00:05:00,098
Yyyyeah.

144
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:02,332
Oooh!

145
00:05:02,367 --> 00:05:05,133
Look, mr. Edward,
can you just ask kenny

146
00:05:05,168 --> 00:05:06,334
How we can
get him out please?

147
00:05:06,369 --> 00:05:07,666
Doesn't work that way-

148
00:05:07,701 --> 00:05:09,300
Now kenny is telling me
that you were his best friends

149
00:05:09,335 --> 00:05:10,599
And he's in
a safe place.

150
00:05:10,634 --> 00:05:12,200
No, no, he's trapped
in cartman's body.

151
00:05:12,235 --> 00:05:13,434
Oh, there's
somebody with him.

152
00:05:13,469 --> 00:05:14,701
Who is kyle?

153
00:05:14,736 --> 00:05:15,899
I'm kyle!

154
00:05:15,934 --> 00:05:17,617
Oh right... and did
an older woman pass.

155
00:05:17,652 --> 00:05:19,300
She's asking for kyle,
maybe a grandma.

156
00:05:19,335 --> 00:05:21,165
Yeah, my grandma-
She's here?

157
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:23,200
She says there's something
she asked you to do

158
00:05:23,235 --> 00:05:24,466
And you're not doing it.

159
00:05:24,501 --> 00:05:26,400
She wants you to
look for four white doves.

160
00:05:26,435 --> 00:05:27,532
Oh my god!

161
00:05:27,567 --> 00:05:29,067
Now she's sending me
a "p" word

162
00:05:29,102 --> 00:05:30,301
Maybe it's a
"b" or a "h"...

163
00:05:30,336 --> 00:05:31,466
My harry
died last year!

164
00:05:31,501 --> 00:05:33,199
Oh it's coming
from over here!

165
00:05:33,234 --> 00:05:35,200
I'm getting all kinds
of voices today, wooo!

166
00:05:36,834 --> 00:05:38,299
Hey, wait
a minute, dude!

167
00:05:38,334 --> 00:05:39,933
Okay, now harry,
he's telling me-

168
00:05:39,968 --> 00:05:41,834
Ooh well, he's saying that
you two used to do things?

169
00:05:41,869 --> 00:05:45,567
And that those
things involved, stuff?

170
00:05:45,602 --> 00:05:47,684
The things
did involve stuff!

171
00:05:47,719 --> 00:05:49,767
Wow-Aoao-Oao!

172
00:05:49,802 --> 00:05:50,933
Aw man!

173
00:05:50,968 --> 00:05:53,367
I can't believe i got
fooled by that asshole!

174
00:05:53,402 --> 00:05:54,499
He seemed
better on tv?

175
00:05:54,534 --> 00:05:56,300
Yeah, they must edit
the shows down on television

176
00:05:56,335 --> 00:05:58,701
To only show him getting
mostly right answers!

177
00:05:58,736 --> 00:06:01,032
Grandma is watching me...
always watching me...

178
00:06:01,067 --> 00:06:03,234
Dude, you don't believe that guy
talked to your grandma, do you?

179
00:06:03,269 --> 00:06:04,734
Aagahgh!
Agahgahgagh!

180
00:06:04,769 --> 00:06:06,065
Eric?

181
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:07,599
It must be
his time!

182
00:06:07,634 --> 00:06:08,434
I think it's
running out!

183
00:06:08,469 --> 00:06:10,632
We've got
no choice.

184
00:06:10,667 --> 00:06:12,067
The only people i know
who might be able to help eric

185
00:06:12,102 --> 00:06:13,065
Are my parents.

186
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:16,000
We'll have to take the
next flight to scotland!

187
00:06:18,033 --> 00:06:20,200
Okay, children, this is your
flight back to colorado.

188
00:06:20,235 --> 00:06:22,367
Your parents are meeting you
at the airport in denver.

189
00:06:22,402 --> 00:06:23,566
We don't get
to go to scotland?

190
00:06:23,601 --> 00:06:25,567
It's too far, and your
parents want you back home.

191
00:06:25,602 --> 00:06:27,534
Oh well, good luck getting
kenny out of you, fatso.

192
00:06:27,569 --> 00:06:28,766
Thanks, asshole.

193
00:06:28,801 --> 00:06:30,032
Come on, we gotta
catch our plane!

194
00:06:30,067 --> 00:06:31,633
You children get right on
that plane now!

195
00:06:31,668 --> 00:06:33,200
This is a final boarding
announcement

196
00:06:33,235 --> 00:06:35,000
For flight 342 to denver.

197
00:06:35,035 --> 00:06:36,251
That's us, come on.

198
00:06:36,286 --> 00:06:37,467
Four white birds!

199
00:06:37,502 --> 00:06:38,399
Huh?

200
00:06:38,434 --> 00:06:40,184
There's four
white birds!

201
00:06:40,219 --> 00:06:41,899
This is what
grandma wants!

202
00:06:41,934 --> 00:06:43,599
She wants me
to attend jewleeard!

203
00:06:43,634 --> 00:06:45,868
Dude, you were going to see
four white birds eventually!

204
00:06:45,903 --> 00:06:47,334
So is it coincidence that
grandma did talk to me

205
00:06:47,369 --> 00:06:49,532
About me going to
jewleeard someday?

206
00:06:49,567 --> 00:06:51,501
Yes, now come on,
our plane's gonna leave.

207
00:06:51,536 --> 00:06:52,767
I'm not going back.

208
00:06:52,802 --> 00:06:53,799
What?!

209
00:06:53,834 --> 00:06:55,300
I have to join jewleeard
and make grandma proud!

210
00:06:55,335 --> 00:06:56,300
Tell my parents
i'll call them.

211
00:06:56,335 --> 00:06:58,167
Kyle!
No, kyle!

212
00:06:58,202 --> 00:06:59,300
Aw crap!

213
00:07:02,534 --> 00:07:04,267
Hey, uh, i need to
talk to mr. Edward, please.

214
00:07:04,302 --> 00:07:06,734
He doesn't do
private readings.

215
00:07:06,769 --> 00:07:07,899
I'm not here
for a reading

216
00:07:07,934 --> 00:07:09,234
I just need to ask him
something real quick.

217
00:07:09,269 --> 00:07:10,167
Alright,
come on in.

218
00:07:12,067 --> 00:07:14,634
Just wait right here,
i'll go fetch him.

219
00:07:15,834 --> 00:07:17,534
Jesus christ...

220
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:19,365
Here he is!

221
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:21,868
Ladies and gentlemen,
john edward.

222
00:07:24,534 --> 00:07:27,232
Thank you, thank you.

223
00:07:27,267 --> 00:07:28,917
Hey, i need to ask you
a big favor.

224
00:07:28,952 --> 00:07:31,042
You did a reading
of my best friend

225
00:07:31,077 --> 00:07:33,133
And uh, well you kinda
messed him up.

226
00:07:33,168 --> 00:07:33,998
Ohhh...

227
00:07:34,033 --> 00:07:35,699
"The john edward show
is not liable for

228
00:07:35,734 --> 00:07:38,234
Opinions and materials given for
entertainment purposes only."

229
00:07:38,269 --> 00:07:40,834
Look, my friend kyle won't
fly back home to colorado.

230
00:07:40,869 --> 00:07:43,365
All i need you to do is
just talk to him and tell him

231
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:45,767
Y'know, that the whole talking
to dead people isn't for real.

232
00:07:45,802 --> 00:07:46,818
Maybe it is
for real.

233
00:07:46,853 --> 00:07:47,799
Right,
but it's not.

234
00:07:47,834 --> 00:07:48,851
It's a trick you do
and i need you

235
00:07:48,886 --> 00:07:49,868
To just let my friend
kyle know that

236
00:07:49,903 --> 00:07:51,098
So he can go on
with his life.

237
00:07:51,133 --> 00:07:52,601
Look, people have the right
to be skeptical.

238
00:07:52,636 --> 00:07:53,833
I really hear
voices in my head.

239
00:07:53,868 --> 00:07:55,234
Yes, we all hear
voices in our heads.

240
00:07:55,269 --> 00:07:56,732
It's called intuition.

241
00:07:56,767 --> 00:07:58,601
Get over yourself and tell my
friend it's just for fun.

242
00:07:58,636 --> 00:07:59,899
Look, what i do
doesn't hurt anybody.

243
00:07:59,934 --> 00:08:01,267
I give people closure and
help them cope with life.

244
00:08:01,302 --> 00:08:03,399
No, you give them
false hope

245
00:08:03,434 --> 00:08:05,033
And a belief in something
that isn't real.

246
00:08:05,068 --> 00:08:05,998
But i'm a psychic.

247
00:08:06,033 --> 00:08:07,234
No dude,
you're a douche.

248
00:08:07,269 --> 00:08:08,399
I'm not a douche!

249
00:08:08,434 --> 00:08:10,200
What if i really believe
dead people talk to me?

250
00:08:10,235 --> 00:08:11,632
Then you're
a stupid douche.

251
00:08:11,667 --> 00:08:13,250
I think i've had enough
of your bullying me!

252
00:08:13,285 --> 00:08:14,799
Get out of my house
or i'll run upstairs

253
00:08:14,834 --> 00:08:17,200
Lock myself in my panic room
and call the police.

254
00:08:17,235 --> 00:08:18,532
I'm nine years old!

255
00:08:18,567 --> 00:08:20,033
I'm not talking to your friend
and i'm not a douche!

256
00:08:20,068 --> 00:08:24,100
Get outta my house
or i'm calling the police!

257
00:08:24,135 --> 00:08:25,933
You are so a douche!

258
00:08:25,968 --> 00:08:28,534
I'm nominating you for biggest
douche in the universe award,

259
00:08:28,569 --> 00:08:29,501
Ya douche!

260
00:08:41,467 --> 00:08:42,534
Son of a bitch!

261
00:08:49,634 --> 00:08:51,050
Kenny!
Shut up, kenny!

262
00:08:51,085 --> 00:08:52,432
You shut up, fat ass!

263
00:08:52,467 --> 00:08:54,634
Hang in there, sweetie,
we'll be there soon.

264
00:08:54,669 --> 00:08:56,232
Welcome aboard scotland air.

265
00:08:56,267 --> 00:08:58,968
Our trip to edinburgh should
take about twelve hours.

266
00:08:59,003 --> 00:09:00,201
Twelve hours?

267
00:09:00,236 --> 00:09:01,365
Jesus christ!

268
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:03,200
In the meantime, we'd like to
show you a complimentary film.

269
00:09:03,235 --> 00:09:05,167
Oh good.

270
00:09:06,868 --> 00:09:09,767
Rob schneider is a
wall street executive.

271
00:09:09,802 --> 00:09:11,267
With everything
going for him!

272
00:09:11,302 --> 00:09:13,566
Only problem is

273
00:09:13,601 --> 00:09:15,234
He's about to become...

274
00:09:15,269 --> 00:09:17,332
A carrot!

275
00:09:17,367 --> 00:09:18,732
I'm a carrot!

276
00:09:18,767 --> 00:09:21,334
It's twenty four
carrot comedy!

277
00:09:21,369 --> 00:09:22,299
Rob schneider is...

278
00:09:22,334 --> 00:09:25,217
"A carrot"
rated pg-13.

279
00:09:25,252 --> 00:09:27,192
Oh for the
love of christ.

280
00:09:27,227 --> 00:09:28,880
I wanna watch,
fat boy!

281
00:09:28,915 --> 00:09:30,534
No, kenny,
it's not funny!

282
00:09:33,901 --> 00:09:34,666
Kyle- Kyle!

283
00:09:34,701 --> 00:09:35,867
Don't try
and stop me, stan,

284
00:09:35,902 --> 00:09:36,998
This is what
my grandma wants!

285
00:09:37,033 --> 00:09:39,067
Look, i went and saw
that john edward guy.

286
00:09:39,102 --> 00:09:39,751
He's just a big douche.

287
00:09:39,786 --> 00:09:40,365
He's not a douche!

288
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:42,265
He talked
to my grandma!

289
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:43,467
Kyle, you can't
run your life based on

290
00:09:43,502 --> 00:09:44,799
What some douchie
psychic said.

291
00:09:44,834 --> 00:09:46,534
They all just use a technique
called "cold reading".

292
00:09:46,569 --> 00:09:47,601
They've used it for
hundreds of years

293
00:09:47,636 --> 00:09:48,599
To make people
believe them.

294
00:09:48,634 --> 00:09:51,000
Hey, woa now,
john edward is for real!

295
00:09:51,035 --> 00:09:51,833
No, he's not.

296
00:09:51,868 --> 00:09:53,199
Yeah, my sister
told me

297
00:09:53,234 --> 00:09:56,133
He knew our mother's name
and when she died!

298
00:09:56,168 --> 00:09:57,165
John edward?

299
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,600
Oh yeah, i heard he walked up
to a guy on the street

300
00:09:59,635 --> 00:10:02,000
And said his dead father
wanted to say happy birthday

301
00:10:02,035 --> 00:10:03,265
<i>And it was his birthday!</i>

302
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:05,334
Yeah, kid, how do
you explain that?

303
00:10:05,369 --> 00:10:06,899
Alright, look
i'll show you.

304
00:10:06,934 --> 00:10:10,067
I just need a volunteer,
how about you?

305
00:10:10,102 --> 00:10:11,234
Ohhh, me!

306
00:10:13,067 --> 00:10:15,234
Okay, i'm going to
pretend that a dead person

307
00:10:15,269 --> 00:10:16,834
Is talking to me
about you, okay?

308
00:10:16,869 --> 00:10:17,566
Okay...

309
00:10:17,601 --> 00:10:18,833
Okay, watch, kyle.

310
00:10:18,868 --> 00:10:20,567
It's an older man-
Someone very close to you.

311
00:10:20,602 --> 00:10:21,933
My father?

312
00:10:21,968 --> 00:10:23,400
Does this month, november,
hold a special significance?

313
00:10:23,435 --> 00:10:25,265
My birthday
is in november!

314
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:28,100
Right, because he's saying
"tell her happy birthday".

315
00:10:28,135 --> 00:10:29,232
Oh my god!

316
00:10:29,267 --> 00:10:30,601
See kyle, i just started with
something really vague.

317
00:10:30,636 --> 00:10:32,232
I chose "older man"
because i'm betting

318
00:10:32,267 --> 00:10:34,267
That based on this woman's age
her father is most likely dead.

319
00:10:34,302 --> 00:10:35,466
But if her
father wasn't dead

320
00:10:35,501 --> 00:10:36,750
I could still say it was
some other older man.

321
00:10:36,785 --> 00:10:38,909
But how'd you know her
birthday was in november?

322
00:10:38,944 --> 00:10:41,033
I didn't, i asked her if
november meant anything.

323
00:10:41,068 --> 00:10:42,632
Her father could have
died in november

324
00:10:42,667 --> 00:10:44,700
Or thanksgiving could've
been really special for them

325
00:10:44,735 --> 00:10:46,734
But i go with the birthday
and validate now as if i knew

326
00:10:46,769 --> 00:10:48,334
By saying, "he wishes you
a happy birthday".

327
00:10:48,369 --> 00:10:50,833
What else does he say?

328
00:10:50,868 --> 00:10:52,265
Okay, i'll just use
an old standard...

329
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:54,901
He's saying, "the money-
Stop worrying about the money".

330
00:10:54,936 --> 00:10:56,199
Oh my god...

331
00:10:56,234 --> 00:10:59,200
My sister and i have been
fighting over his inheritance!

332
00:10:59,235 --> 00:11:00,401
That's amazing!

333
00:11:00,436 --> 00:11:01,532
No, it isn't.

334
00:11:01,567 --> 00:11:02,868
When a father dies
inheritance is usually an issue.

335
00:11:02,903 --> 00:11:04,267
And money is something
everyone worries about.

336
00:11:04,302 --> 00:11:06,268
That sounds a little
too coincidental.

337
00:11:06,303 --> 00:11:08,199
Yes, there's only
one explanation.

338
00:11:08,234 --> 00:11:10,400
This kid can communicate
with the dead!

339
00:11:10,435 --> 00:11:11,532
Wow!Wow!
Woaaa!

340
00:11:11,567 --> 00:11:12,983
Do me next, i want to
talk to my mother!

341
00:11:13,018 --> 00:11:14,400
Can you try to reach
my grandfather?

342
00:11:14,435 --> 00:11:15,632
You have to tell me

343
00:11:15,667 --> 00:11:17,033
If my sister is
in a good place!

344
00:11:17,068 --> 00:11:18,466
Me next!
I'll pay you!

345
00:11:18,501 --> 00:11:20,534
Kid, how would you
like your own

346
00:11:20,569 --> 00:11:23,334
"Talking to the dead" show?

347
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:32,965
Hi, pop!

348
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,634
Junior! Aw son, it's
good to see you, na!

349
00:11:35,669 --> 00:11:37,268
These are my friends,
the cartmans.

350
00:11:37,303 --> 00:11:38,833
Well come in
out of the cold, na!

351
00:11:38,868 --> 00:11:41,234
There's heavy fog on
the moors tonight.

352
00:11:41,269 --> 00:11:43,601
Look what the
cat dragged in, nelle!

353
00:11:43,636 --> 00:11:45,467
Oh my baby,
come home!

354
00:11:45,502 --> 00:11:46,732
Hi, momma!

355
00:11:46,767 --> 00:11:48,200
Lord, i thought you
wasn't coming til 9:00!

356
00:11:48,235 --> 00:11:50,334
Mom, this is
my friend ms. Cartman.

357
00:11:50,369 --> 00:11:52,599
Please,
call me liane!

358
00:11:52,634 --> 00:11:54,799
So nice to
have you here, liane.

359
00:11:54,834 --> 00:11:56,767
And is this the children
you told us about?

360
00:11:56,802 --> 00:11:59,000
Yeah, pop,
this is eric.

361
00:11:59,035 --> 00:11:59,334
Let's see hya...

362
00:11:59,369 --> 00:12:03,866
Mm-Hmm...

363
00:12:03,901 --> 00:12:06,901
Yup, there is definitely more
than one children in there!

364
00:12:06,936 --> 00:12:07,799
Oh dear.

365
00:12:07,834 --> 00:12:09,332
Nelle, you best
have at it, na.

366
00:12:09,367 --> 00:12:12,534
Oh lord, and i just put the
roast in the oven, too.

367
00:12:12,569 --> 00:12:14,234
Ain't gonna have no time
now to baste it...

368
00:12:14,269 --> 00:12:16,766
Don't nobody blame me.

369
00:12:16,801 --> 00:12:18,934
Woman can't baste the roast and do
everything else at the same time.

370
00:12:18,969 --> 00:12:22,601
I ain't saying the roast is
going to be terrible,

371
00:12:22,636 --> 00:12:23,666
Maybe just a little dry

372
00:12:23,701 --> 00:12:26,267
But i suppose we can make
some extra gravy

373
00:12:26,302 --> 00:12:27,466
To take the dryness
out later.

374
00:12:27,501 --> 00:12:30,501
Alright, children,
stand up on this chair, na.

375
00:12:30,536 --> 00:12:31,466
Right na?

376
00:12:31,501 --> 00:12:33,868
Yes, right na.

377
00:12:36,167 --> 00:12:37,165
Watch it, lady!

378
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:40,501
Just stay still, eric,
mom knows what she's doing!

379
00:12:41,567 --> 00:12:42,866
At a very young age

380
00:12:42,901 --> 00:12:44,734
One young boy learned
he had a special gift

381
00:12:44,769 --> 00:12:48,434
This is
"the other side"

382
00:12:50,267 --> 00:12:52,050
Okay...
listen to me.

383
00:12:52,085 --> 00:12:53,799
Listen very carefully.

384
00:12:53,834 --> 00:12:55,684
This-Is-A-Trick
that i am doing, okay?

385
00:12:55,719 --> 00:12:57,559
Watch- All i'm gonna do
is say a name

386
00:12:57,594 --> 00:12:59,365
That i'm gonna
pick at random, okay?

387
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:03,501
"They want me to acknowledge
pete or peter... "

388
00:13:03,536 --> 00:13:05,834
Yes!
Yes my peter!

389
00:13:05,869 --> 00:13:07,132
Ooohh!

390
00:13:07,167 --> 00:13:08,332
No, stop clapping!

391
00:13:08,367 --> 00:13:09,866
All i did was
pick a random name

392
00:13:09,901 --> 00:13:11,167
And wait for somebody in the
audience to give a response.

393
00:13:11,202 --> 00:13:14,000
Now that i see that there
is a lone woman, crying

394
00:13:14,035 --> 00:13:16,334
My instinct tells me
peter was her husband.

395
00:13:16,369 --> 00:13:18,234
So i say,
"peter was your husband?"

396
00:13:18,269 --> 00:13:20,267
Yes! Yes,
my husband, peter!

397
00:13:20,302 --> 00:13:22,799
Ohhh!Wow!
Ooh!

398
00:13:22,834 --> 00:13:25,434
Stop it!
I didn't do anything!

399
00:13:25,469 --> 00:13:26,666
You knew
peter was dead!

400
00:13:26,701 --> 00:13:28,467
I didn't start
by saying "peter is dead"

401
00:13:28,502 --> 00:13:29,566
I started by saying,

402
00:13:29,601 --> 00:13:30,799
"They want me to
acknowledge peter".

403
00:13:30,834 --> 00:13:32,566
That could have meant
peter was in the audience

404
00:13:32,601 --> 00:13:34,133
Or that peter was somebody's
friend or that peter had died.

405
00:13:34,168 --> 00:13:35,666
I couldn't
be wrong, see?!

406
00:13:35,701 --> 00:13:37,868
Now, i can look at this woman
and see that she's fairly young

407
00:13:37,903 --> 00:13:39,234
So odds are, her husband was
fairly young when he died.

408
00:13:39,269 --> 00:13:41,098
So i can say something like,

409
00:13:41,133 --> 00:13:44,033
"I'm getting that peter's
death was very untimely."

410
00:13:44,068 --> 00:13:45,265
Yes, it was!

411
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:46,200
Ohhh!Wow!
Ooh!

412
00:13:46,235 --> 00:13:48,365
Amazing!

413
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:49,667
Ask peter if he knows
my little billy!

414
00:13:49,702 --> 00:13:53,501
Okay...
let's back up.

415
00:13:55,234 --> 00:13:57,133
Not literally!

416
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:01,783
In the name of
all that is holy

417
00:14:01,818 --> 00:14:03,267
We demand this spirit
be set free!

418
00:14:03,302 --> 00:14:05,301
Agh... agh...

419
00:14:05,336 --> 00:14:07,265
There we go!

420
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:08,234
We're gettin'
something, na!

421
00:14:08,269 --> 00:14:10,766
Come out, spirit soul!

422
00:14:10,801 --> 00:14:13,334
Come on out, na!
It's safe!

423
00:14:13,369 --> 00:14:14,899
Ughhhhhh!

424
00:14:14,934 --> 00:14:15,833
Here it comes!

425
00:14:15,868 --> 00:14:17,767
The spirit is
coming out, na!

426
00:14:18,834 --> 00:14:21,567
Ooh, that's
the potatoes.

427
00:14:24,033 --> 00:14:26,567
Well, hold on the potatoes
two seconds woman!

428
00:14:26,602 --> 00:14:28,334
The soul's
coming out, na!

429
00:14:28,369 --> 00:14:29,901
Yaghagh!

430
00:14:29,936 --> 00:14:31,399
Aaghaghag!

431
00:14:31,434 --> 00:14:32,699
It's almost out!

432
00:14:32,734 --> 00:14:34,200
Alright, son, now
bring me the victim child!

433
00:14:34,235 --> 00:14:36,217
The victim child?

434
00:14:36,252 --> 00:14:38,165
Yeah, you know!

435
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:39,833
The child that we sacrifice,

436
00:14:39,868 --> 00:14:43,017
So we could put kenny's soul
into its body!

437
00:14:43,052 --> 00:14:46,132
Oh lord they didn't
bring a victim child.

438
00:14:46,167 --> 00:14:49,334
Where were we going to find
a child to sacrifice?

439
00:14:49,369 --> 00:14:52,501
We weren't going to ask you
where you got it from.

440
00:14:52,536 --> 00:14:53,801
Blabblefalg!

441
00:14:53,836 --> 00:14:55,032
Aw, damage!

442
00:14:55,067 --> 00:14:56,984
The spirit's out and
it don't have nowhere to go!

443
00:14:57,019 --> 00:14:58,901
Ooh thomas, don't let it
get on the curtains.

452
00:15:33,367 --> 00:15:34,998
Here, look, kyle.

453
00:15:35,033 --> 00:15:36,632
I found tons of testimonials
on the internet

454
00:15:36,667 --> 00:15:38,634
Stating that john edward
has the entire studio wired

455
00:15:38,669 --> 00:15:40,751
To hear what people are
talking about before the show

456
00:15:40,786 --> 00:15:42,676
And he pays actors to be
plants in the audience!

457
00:15:42,711 --> 00:15:44,567
You're just jealous he's a
better psychic than you.

458
00:15:44,602 --> 00:15:45,965
Fine, i give up!

459
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,834
You wanna stay in new york,
then go ahead!

460
00:15:50,767 --> 00:15:53,601
So, you think you can talk to
dead people better than me?

461
00:15:53,636 --> 00:15:55,165
No, i don't think
either one of us can.

462
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:57,200
They told me your show is
getting better ratings than mine!

463
00:15:57,235 --> 00:15:59,267
That you're saying
i'm a fraud on your show!

464
00:15:59,302 --> 00:16:00,732
You better not
ever call me a liar

465
00:16:00,767 --> 00:16:04,267
Or a fake or a douche again or
else i'll sue you for slander!

466
00:16:04,302 --> 00:16:06,834
I am saying this
to you, john edward.

467
00:16:06,869 --> 00:16:08,766
You are a liar,
you are a fake

468
00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:10,766
And you are the
biggest douche ever.

469
00:16:10,801 --> 00:16:13,467
Everything i tell people is
positive and gives them hope!

470
00:16:13,502 --> 00:16:14,933
How does that
make me a douche?

471
00:16:14,968 --> 00:16:16,599
Because the big questions
in life are tough.

472
00:16:16,634 --> 00:16:18,650
"Why are we here?" "Where are
from?" "Where are we going?"

473
00:16:18,685 --> 00:16:20,632
But if people believe in
asshole douchie liars like you

474
00:16:20,667 --> 00:16:22,968
We're never going to find the
real answers to those questions.

475
00:16:23,003 --> 00:16:23,933
You aren't just lying,

476
00:16:23,968 --> 00:16:25,834
You're slowing down
the progress of all mankind.

477
00:16:25,869 --> 00:16:26,299
You douche.

478
00:16:26,334 --> 00:16:28,432
I'm not a douche!

479
00:16:28,467 --> 00:16:30,666
And i challenge you
to a psychic showdown!

480
00:16:30,701 --> 00:16:33,934
I'll prove to the world that
i'm psychic and you're not!

481
00:16:33,969 --> 00:16:35,065
Fine, douche!

482
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:36,501
I'm not
a douche!

483
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:42,100
Well come on,
the soul is in here,

484
00:16:42,135 --> 00:16:42,732
It's panicking, na!

485
00:16:42,767 --> 00:16:44,332
It's going
to the light!

486
00:16:44,367 --> 00:16:45,666
Unfortunately it's
the living room light!

487
00:16:45,701 --> 00:16:48,534
I'll open a window, you
try to chase it out, thomas.

488
00:16:48,569 --> 00:16:50,766
Go on, na, soul, na!

489
00:16:50,801 --> 00:16:52,151
Here spirit,
come out the window

490
00:16:52,186 --> 00:16:53,466
And i'll give you
tree-Fiddy!

491
00:16:53,501 --> 00:16:56,234
Now don't go offering the soul
no tree-Fiddy, woman!

492
00:16:56,269 --> 00:16:57,799
I just trying
to persuade it.

493
00:16:57,834 --> 00:16:59,567
Well, i know but
you could at least

494
00:16:59,602 --> 00:17:00,934
Start at a buck o' five
or something!

495
00:17:00,969 --> 00:17:02,668
Oh christmas,
there it go again!

496
00:17:02,703 --> 00:17:04,185
It's headin'
for the kitchen!

497
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:05,632
Oh thomas,
the pot roast!

498
00:17:05,667 --> 00:17:09,734
Don't let it
get in the roast!

499
00:17:13,267 --> 00:17:15,432
Oh well...

500
00:17:15,467 --> 00:17:18,501
I guess the child's
a pot roast now.

501
00:17:18,536 --> 00:17:19,766
What do we do
with it now?

502
00:17:19,801 --> 00:17:21,767
I'll wrap it up
with plastic wrap

503
00:17:21,802 --> 00:17:23,699
So you can take it
home with you.

504
00:17:23,734 --> 00:17:26,167
Should last a few months
in the freezer...

505
00:17:26,202 --> 00:17:27,567
Hey, i feel
a lot better.

506
00:17:27,602 --> 00:17:29,098
Eric, you're okay!

507
00:17:29,133 --> 00:17:31,817
Oh baby,
your time is back!

508
00:17:31,852 --> 00:17:34,501
This child...
is clean.

509
00:17:35,968 --> 00:17:37,434
Ladies and gentlemen
it's "psychic showdown".

510
00:17:37,469 --> 00:17:39,934
Here are john edward
and stan marsh.

511
00:17:41,434 --> 00:17:42,766
Thank you!

512
00:17:42,801 --> 00:17:44,000
Alright, asshole, i know you're
here to try and throw me off

513
00:17:44,035 --> 00:17:46,201
So go ahead
give me your best shot!

514
00:17:46,236 --> 00:17:47,768
No, i don't want to
talk to you,

515
00:17:47,803 --> 00:17:49,300
I want to talk
to the audience.

516
00:17:49,335 --> 00:17:50,365
What- Why?

517
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:51,599
You see, i learned
something today.

518
00:17:51,634 --> 00:17:52,968
At first i thought
you were all just stupid

519
00:17:53,003 --> 00:17:54,065
Listening to this
douche's advice.

520
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:55,667
But now i understand
that you're all here

521
00:17:55,702 --> 00:17:56,998
Because you're scared.

522
00:17:57,033 --> 00:17:59,033
You're scared of death and he
offers you understanding.

523
00:17:59,068 --> 00:18:01,284
You all want to believe in it
so much, i know you do.

524
00:18:01,319 --> 00:18:03,501
You find comfort in the thought
that your loved ones

525
00:18:03,536 --> 00:18:05,133
Are floating around trying
to talk to you.

526
00:18:05,168 --> 00:18:05,866
But think about it...

527
00:18:05,901 --> 00:18:07,299
Is that really
what you want?

528
00:18:07,334 --> 00:18:08,634
To just be floating around
after you die

529
00:18:08,669 --> 00:18:10,098
Having to talk
to this asshole?

530
00:18:10,133 --> 00:18:13,100
We need to recognize this stuff
for what it is- Magic tricks.

531
00:18:13,135 --> 00:18:15,701
Because whatever is really
going on in life and in death

532
00:18:15,736 --> 00:18:20,033
Is much more amazing
than this douche.

533
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:29,732
You're right, stan.

534
00:18:29,767 --> 00:18:31,284
My grandma isn't
floating around

535
00:18:31,319 --> 00:18:32,801
Judging me and
watching what i do.

536
00:18:32,836 --> 00:18:33,732
She's dead.

537
00:18:33,767 --> 00:18:34,234
Dead and gone forever!

538
00:18:34,269 --> 00:18:35,998
Yeah!

539
00:18:36,033 --> 00:18:38,050
But i do have a special power
i know i do!

540
00:18:38,085 --> 00:18:40,067
There's nothing special
about you, dude.

541
00:18:40,102 --> 00:18:40,766
Get over yourself.

542
00:18:40,801 --> 00:18:42,267
Goddammit,
i'm special!

543
00:18:45,234 --> 00:18:46,150

544
00:18:46,185 --> 00:18:47,067
Agh!

Well, thank you
very much!

550
00:19:09,202 --> 00:19:10,699
No, it can't be.

551
00:19:10,734 --> 00:19:14,601

You are the first nominee
from the milky way galaxy!

556
00:19:25,602 --> 00:19:27,234
Congratulations!

557
00:19:27,269 --> 00:19:28,299
Oh dude!

00:19:35,834 --> 00:19:37,767

Now do you people

564
00:19:50,567 --> 00:19:51,666
I don't know...

565
00:19:51,701 --> 00:19:53,801
How'd edward know
my father died in march?

566
00:19:55,901 --> 00:19:57,332
Goddammit that was
a long flight!

567
00:19:57,367 --> 00:19:59,267
I thought'd we never get out of

568
00:19:59,302 --> 00:20:00,965
Oh it's so good

00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:06,850
Who's got
the pot roast?

573
00:20:06,885 --> 00:20:08,466
I thought
