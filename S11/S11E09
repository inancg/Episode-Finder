Episode 11x09 "More Crap"

10
00:00:37,325 --> 00:00:41,360
Well, there's no doubt in my mind, Mr. Marsh. You are constipated.

11
00:00:41,491 --> 00:00:43,328
Thanks for the news flash!

12
00:00:43,330 --> 00:00:47,229
I haven't taken a crap in over three weeks! The question is why?!

13
00:00:47,255 --> 00:00:52,317
Well, what food have you been eating? - P.F. Chang's, mostly. Good stuff.

14
00:00:52,459 --> 00:00:55,342
I'm going to prescribe a laxative.

15
00:00:55,487 --> 00:01:01,492
But I must warn you: when you do finally pass this stool, it might be very painful.

16
00:01:02,045 --> 00:01:04,100
How painful is "painful"?

17
00:01:15,008 --> 00:01:17,190
Oh God. Oh, here it comes.

18
00:01:19,786 --> 00:01:23,981
Whoa, hot! Hot, hot! Whoa, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot!

19
00:01:35,068 --> 00:01:38,313
Oh, it's over. It's over.

20
00:01:38,495 --> 00:01:42,210
Oh God. I feel so much better.

21
00:01:47,968 --> 00:01:49,430
Wow.

22
00:01:50,117 --> 00:01:53,092
That is huge.

23
00:01:53,817 --> 00:01:57,553
That has got to be the biggest crap I've ever taken.

24
00:01:58,465 --> 00:02:03,191
Hey, hey Sharon. Sharon you gotta come see this.

25
00:02:03,478 --> 00:02:04,863
Sha-Sharon?

26
00:02:05,338 --> 00:02:08,041
What is it, Randy? Do you have any- Oh, Randy!

27
00:02:08,067 --> 00:02:11,360
Will you look at that? Is that the biggest crap you've ever seen or what?

28
00:02:11,388 --> 00:02:15,390
Flush the toilet for Christ's sake! - Come on! That's pretty impressive!

29
00:02:15,418 --> 00:02:19,172
Hey Stan! Stan, look at this. - Randy!

30
00:02:19,208 --> 00:02:22,102
Look what your old man made. - No way!

31
00:02:22,116 --> 00:02:25,112
Huh? Never seen one that big, have you? - No, never.

32
00:02:25,146 --> 00:02:27,171
Gross, Dad, sick!

33
00:02:27,215 --> 00:02:31,540
All right, will you flush the toilet now?! - I'll try, but I don't think...

34
00:02:31,577 --> 00:02:35,332
Wait a minute. I gotta call Jimbo first. - Why?!

35
00:02:35,365 --> 00:02:36,860
He's gotta see this.

36
00:02:36,885 --> 00:02:39,451
No, we are flushing the toilet right now- - No!

37
00:02:39,468 --> 00:02:43,860
Jimbo has to see it so when I tell the guys how big it was, they'll know I'm not lying!

38
00:02:43,895 --> 00:02:47,613
Oh, for the love of God, Randy! - Sharon, this is important!

39
00:02:47,648 --> 00:02:50,510
Stan, go call your Uncle Jimbo. I'm gonna stand guard.

40
00:02:55,436 --> 00:02:58,161
Hey guys! - Hey Randy.

41
00:02:58,196 --> 00:03:01,540
Are you feeling better? - Yeah, I'm totally fine now.

42
00:03:01,575 --> 00:03:04,513
You guys shoulda seen the crap Randy took last night!

43
00:03:04,528 --> 00:03:08,920
It was honestly, the biggest crap anyone has ever taken. Ever.

44
00:03:08,946 --> 00:03:10,481
Well I don't know about ever...

45
00:03:10,518 --> 00:03:13,732
I'm telling you this thing was the size of a freaking football.

46
00:03:13,758 --> 00:03:15,472
I guess it was pretty big.

47
00:03:15,558 --> 00:03:19,141
A football? That's amazing. - I've never heard of one that big.

48
00:03:19,155 --> 00:03:22,430
Oh, my brother took a crap once, that was enormous.

49
00:03:22,435 --> 00:03:25,532
It was the biggest in the history of the world, I think.

50
00:03:28,587 --> 00:03:30,252
It wasn't bigger than mine was.

51
00:03:30,507 --> 00:03:33,471
Oh no, seriously, this crap was a monster!

52
00:03:35,865 --> 00:03:38,073
Mine... mine was bigger.

53
00:03:38,436 --> 00:03:40,073
I doubt it.

54
00:03:41,176 --> 00:03:42,752
You wanna see it?

55
00:03:50,205 --> 00:03:52,183
Oh my freaking Lord.

56
00:03:52,205 --> 00:03:56,412
That did not seriously come out of your ass. - Oh yes, it did.

57
00:03:56,428 --> 00:03:58,862
Go ahead and check it for splits. It's one solid piece.

58
00:03:58,887 --> 00:03:59,981
Jesus...

59
00:03:59,985 --> 00:04:02,821
That uh, a little bigger than your brother's there, Gerald?

60
00:04:02,856 --> 00:04:06,221
It's... other-worldly.

61
00:04:06,255 --> 00:04:09,533
Randy, have you called the people from the Guinness Book of World Records? I mean...

62
00:04:09,555 --> 00:04:12,550
this might seriously be the biggest crap in history!

63
00:04:12,598 --> 00:04:15,493
That's why I gotta make sure to keep it safe.

64
00:04:17,727 --> 00:04:20,740
Randy Marsh! - Aw crap!

65
00:04:20,777 --> 00:04:23,711
What the hell do you think you're doing keeping that thing in our house?!

66
00:04:23,716 --> 00:04:26,310
The guys agree, Sharon: it could be a record holder.

67
00:04:26,337 --> 00:04:29,593
Why are men so obsessed with how big their crap is?!

68
00:04:32,965 --> 00:04:36,112
Guinness World Records America. How can I help you?

69
00:04:37,427 --> 00:04:39,473
The biggest crap?

70
00:04:40,157 --> 00:04:44,001
We actually don't keep track of that record, sir.

71
00:04:44,546 --> 00:04:46,980
Because we don't want to.

72
00:04:47,448 --> 00:04:51,732
Look, we get calls from men all the time who believe they took the biggest crap

73
00:04:51,737 --> 00:04:55,232
and we simply can't handle all the measuring and verification.

74
00:04:55,265 --> 00:05:00,022
You need to call the European Fecal Standards and Measurements Office in Zurich.

75
00:05:00,337 --> 00:05:04,051
You're welcome. Jeez, another one.

76
00:05:06,035 --> 00:05:07,801
Guinness World Records America.

77
00:05:07,847 --> 00:05:13,673
Yes, hello. My name is Randy Marsh and I believe I took the world's biggest crap.

78
00:05:16,315 --> 00:05:20,700
You need to call the European Fecal Standards and Measurements Office in Zurich.

79
00:05:20,738 --> 00:05:23,632
Their number is listed on their Web site.

80
00:05:29,466 --> 00:05:34,063
Herr President, take a look at this. It is a crap sent to us from the United States.

81
00:05:34,098 --> 00:05:36,163
Very nice.

82
00:05:36,295 --> 00:05:38,063
Has it been checked for accuracy?

83
00:05:38,065 --> 00:05:40,963
It appears to be legitimate, based on the photo.

84
00:05:40,985 --> 00:05:45,010
We estimate that the crap is over eight and a half Courics!

85
00:05:46,258 --> 00:05:49,401
We'd better get on a plane. Right away.

86
00:05:53,876 --> 00:05:55,541
Hm, enshnusen?

87
00:05:55,716 --> 00:05:57,753
Verron snusunarich.

88
00:05:59,695 --> 00:06:03,590
What was your primary diet for this poo, Mr. Marsh?

89
00:06:03,625 --> 00:06:07,243
Mostly P.F. Chang's. General Tsao's Chicken.

90
00:06:07,275 --> 00:06:11,051
And a lot of Aunt Jemima's Frozen Sausage Biscuits in the morning.

91
00:06:11,086 --> 00:06:16,063
I believe I detect some cabbage as well? - Oh yes, I had a lot of kim chee.

92
00:06:16,336 --> 00:06:19,111
You have got to be kidding me.

93
00:06:19,146 --> 00:06:22,521
These guys are from Zurich, Sharon! They're Europeans!

94
00:06:22,556 --> 00:06:27,730
It is a tremendous crap, Mr. Marsh. - For the love of God!

95
00:06:28,238 --> 00:06:34,091
Your crap officially weighs, 8.6 Courics. - Courics?

96
00:06:34,126 --> 00:06:36,631
The standard measuring unit for human feces.

97
00:06:36,656 --> 00:06:40,440
One Katie Couric is approximately two and a half pounds of excrement.

98
00:06:40,475 --> 00:06:44,631
The current record is a crap weighing 7.5 Courics.

99
00:06:45,127 --> 00:06:47,470
But that means... - That's right.

100
00:06:47,505 --> 00:06:51,160
You are the new world's champion! - Really?!

101
00:06:51,196 --> 00:06:53,781
You mean, really?!

102
00:06:55,587 --> 00:06:59,952
Hey Stan! Hey Sharon! Hey everybody!

103
00:07:00,418 --> 00:07:03,283
Well, I guess we'd better call the old champoin...

104
00:07:03,286 --> 00:07:07,190
and let him know his record has just been broken.

105
00:07:08,077 --> 00:07:11,943
He has won twenty-two Grammy's, countless humanitarian awards...

106
00:07:11,947 --> 00:07:16,951
and is the only person ever to be nominated for an Academy Award, a Golden Globe...

107
00:07:16,956 --> 00:07:21,152
and the Nobel Peace Prize. Ladies and gentlemen, Bono!

108
00:07:26,006 --> 00:07:30,251
Thank you. Thank you so much for this newest award, it means so much.

109
00:07:31,976 --> 00:07:35,103
Excuse me. I must be getting another award.

110
00:07:35,296 --> 00:07:36,931
Yes? - Yes, Bono.

111
00:07:36,937 --> 00:07:42,260
Sir, we wish to inform you that your record for biggest crap has just been broken.

112
00:07:42,888 --> 00:07:46,410
What?! That's impossible! How big was it?

113
00:07:54,746 --> 00:07:57,680
We are here to honor the first American...

114
00:07:57,715 --> 00:08:03,033
to bring home the distinguished EFSM medal for biggest crap ever taken.

115
00:08:05,218 --> 00:08:09,481
Hey look, Sharon, it's the President! Hey Sharon!

116
00:08:10,068 --> 00:08:15,871
To present the award I give you the dean of the EFSM, Sir Orloff Broloff.

117
00:08:18,745 --> 00:08:24,711
Thank you, Senator. For over a hundred years, the European Fecal Standards and Meas-

118
00:08:24,717 --> 00:08:26,960
Herr Broloff! Herr Broloff!

119
00:08:28,598 --> 00:08:29,741
Das shpoitenhoff?

120
00:08:29,766 --> 00:08:31,192
Ah ladies and gentlemen...

121
00:08:31,207 --> 00:08:36,460
I understand we have just received a special video-taped announcement from Bono!

122
00:08:37,226 --> 00:08:38,991
Bono? Cool!

123
00:08:39,016 --> 00:08:42,393
Could we play the tape on the big screen, please?

124
00:08:43,067 --> 00:08:46,643
Hello everyone! I, am Bono.

125
00:08:56,207 --> 00:09:00,763
For years it has been my honor to try and bring focus to the needs in Africa.

126
00:09:00,765 --> 00:09:03,873
And today, I have very exciting news.

127
00:09:03,887 --> 00:09:10,222
Last night, at twenty past eight, I took a crap weighing nine and a half Courics.

128
00:09:12,516 --> 00:09:13,920
Bono?!

129
00:09:14,825 --> 00:09:19,051
As you can see, it is one solid piece. It is my biggest crap to date.

130
00:09:19,076 --> 00:09:23,541
And I swear to its authenticity. Thank you, and God bless.

131
00:09:29,408 --> 00:09:34,452
You heard it, ladies and gentlemen! The official biggest crap is 9.5 Courics!

132
00:09:34,467 --> 00:09:36,972
Congratulations to Bono!

133
00:09:55,875 --> 00:09:59,710
Dad, I think dinner's almost ready.

134
00:09:59,746 --> 00:10:01,550
I almost did it.

135
00:10:02,476 --> 00:10:05,090
I almost made something of myself.

136
00:10:05,778 --> 00:10:10,613
You know, when you get real close, you start to think that maybe your life is gonna matter.

137
00:10:12,846 --> 00:10:16,981
I mean, this was something I made!

138
00:10:17,008 --> 00:10:21,733
Something that came from me! That was a a part of me!

139
00:10:22,135 --> 00:10:25,381
The only thing I ever made that was any good!

140
00:10:28,066 --> 00:10:31,131
Gee, thanks a lot, Dad. - You're welcome.

141
00:10:31,147 --> 00:10:32,331
And I just...

142
00:10:32,338 --> 00:10:38,322
I know that this late in my life I'll never come so close to finally having meaning.

143
00:10:39,316 --> 00:10:41,520
Come on guys, lasagna's ready.

144
00:10:42,701 --> 00:10:45,438
Oh. Lasagna's ready.

145
00:10:45,830 --> 00:10:50,229
You hear that, Stan? Mom says lasagna is ready!

146
00:10:50,245 --> 00:10:53,437
I can see through your sarcasm, Sharon!

147
00:10:53,729 --> 00:10:56,891
What are you talking about? - You can say it, Sharon!

148
00:10:56,926 --> 00:10:59,440
I know Bono's better than me!

149
00:10:59,487 --> 00:11:01,882
I'm sorry I'm not Bono, all right?!

150
00:11:01,915 --> 00:11:05,990
Sorry that I don't have billions of dollars and a Nobel prize nomination!

151
00:11:06,026 --> 00:11:10,193
Randy, this is ridiculous! - Oh, that's real mature, Sharon!

152
00:11:10,227 --> 00:11:14,090
Just act like everything's funny! It's a big joke to you, isn't it?!

153
00:11:14,125 --> 00:11:17,851
Just a big joke! Don't touch me!

154
00:11:18,946 --> 00:11:23,812
Can you believe him?! All this over what guy took the biggest crap!

155
00:11:23,848 --> 00:11:27,123
You don't understand, Mom. You just don't understand.

156
00:11:28,156 --> 00:11:30,291
Wha? Wha?

157
00:11:37,417 --> 00:11:41,190
How come they just let that Bono guy send a picture of his crap?

158
00:11:41,326 --> 00:11:45,632
Because he's Bono, that's why. - But he could have faked it. It isn't fair!

159
00:11:45,675 --> 00:11:49,710
Doesn't matter. He's got the record now, there's nothing I can do.

160
00:11:50,695 --> 00:11:54,521
Oh yes there is! You could do it again! - What?

161
00:11:54,557 --> 00:11:58,760
Think about it. You weren't even trying to take the biggest crap last time.

162
00:11:58,766 --> 00:12:01,500
Imagine if you actually worked at it!

163
00:12:01,536 --> 00:12:03,852
Hey. Hey that's right.

164
00:12:03,878 --> 00:12:07,703
No. I can't go through all that again. It's too much.

165
00:12:07,738 --> 00:12:11,602
Come on, Randy. I'll bet you can crap that big again easy!

166
00:12:11,637 --> 00:12:14,621
With the right diet and training, who knows what you're capable of?

167
00:12:14,647 --> 00:12:20,373
Guys, forget it! It's over! It was a fluke crap, I'll never take one that big again!

168
00:12:20,727 --> 00:12:24,542
Is it over, Randy?! We all saw that crap you took!

169
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:30,073
That was no fluke! There's something inside you that made you able to do it!

170
00:12:30,258 --> 00:12:34,971
Randy, you have a gift. Now who knows why God chose you, but he did!

171
00:12:35,005 --> 00:12:39,563
And if you walk away now, you'll always wonder...

172
00:12:39,607 --> 00:12:42,273
how big a crap you could have taken!

173
00:12:43,967 --> 00:12:48,083
I would need a lot of help. - That's what we're here for.

174
00:12:48,116 --> 00:12:50,230
Come on, Randy, what do you say?!

175
00:12:51,108 --> 00:12:52,632
I say...

176
00:12:53,825 --> 00:12:56,363
Let's give Bono a run for his money!

177
00:13:03,985 --> 00:13:06,502
This is CNN Headline News.

178
00:13:06,545 --> 00:13:09,193
Tonight, a possible attack on Iran...

179
00:13:09,218 --> 00:13:12,551
may mean the beginning of a new war in the Middle East.

180
00:13:12,585 --> 00:13:13,942
Oh no.

181
00:13:13,967 --> 00:13:19,212
But first, the record for the world's biggest crap, will it again be broken?

182
00:13:19,477 --> 00:13:23,480
Randy Marsh of Colorado is now three weeks into his quest to make a new crap.

183
00:13:23,517 --> 00:13:27,281
Spending nearly every waking hour at P.F. Chang's.

184
00:13:27,727 --> 00:13:29,780
Is this really newsworthy?

185
00:13:30,068 --> 00:13:32,242
You just don't understand.

186
00:13:32,465 --> 00:13:34,112
You're right. I don't.

187
00:13:34,148 --> 00:13:37,781
At the same time, some people are questioning Bono's current record entry...

188
00:13:37,785 --> 00:13:40,592
saying nobody has ever seen it in person.

189
00:13:40,617 --> 00:13:44,912
Bono could not be reached for comment, as he is currently in Africa helping the needy.

190
00:13:51,766 --> 00:13:54,240
Hello, hello.

191
00:13:54,526 --> 00:13:59,050
Marsh is attempting to break the record again. We thought you should know.

192
00:13:59,086 --> 00:14:03,692
He can't beat my nine and a half Courics! - Well he's going to try.

193
00:14:03,728 --> 00:14:08,212
Fine, but he has to take the crap in front of you! In Zurich.

194
00:14:08,258 --> 00:14:11,012
Bono, we've never had that rule before.

195
00:14:11,056 --> 00:14:13,230
I's the only way you can know he's not cheating!

196
00:14:13,255 --> 00:14:16,712
If he doesn't crap in Zurich, it shouldn't count!

197
00:14:19,155 --> 00:14:20,983
Ultrasound is very simple, Mr. Marsh.

198
00:14:20,986 --> 00:14:23,223
We're going to use harmless waves to look inside your belly.

199
00:14:23,226 --> 00:14:26,290
Just gonna put some warm gel on your stomach first.

200
00:14:27,488 --> 00:14:29,642
Okay, take a deep breath.

201
00:14:30,198 --> 00:14:35,531
I see the crap now. I can't say for sure, but I, I'd say is about...

202
00:14:35,567 --> 00:14:38,520
14 Courics. - Fourteen?!

203
00:14:38,568 --> 00:14:41,021
That's great, Randy! - Can I, Can I see it?

204
00:14:41,035 --> 00:14:46,773
Sure. This is your colon and here is the feces growing inside your belly.

205
00:15:01,315 --> 00:15:02,811
Guys, we have a problem!

206
00:15:02,827 --> 00:15:06,890
I talked to the EFSM and they say Randy has to take the crap in Zurich.

207
00:15:06,925 --> 00:15:08,040
In Zurich?

208
00:15:08,046 --> 00:15:10,870
They say that Bono is demanding it and that their hands are tied.

209
00:15:10,908 --> 00:15:15,332
I'm sorry Mr. Marsh, I I cannot condone you traveling on an airplane in your condition.

210
00:15:15,357 --> 00:15:18,742
It is never safe to fly during your turd trimester.

211
00:15:24,768 --> 00:15:30,540
Hi, could I speak to Mr. Bono, please? - Mr. Bono, you have a young gentleman caller!

212
00:15:35,047 --> 00:15:37,913
Get the jet ready, Bovis! I've got to be going.

213
00:15:38,806 --> 00:15:42,510
Hi, my name is Stan Marsh. My dad's trying to beat your record for biggest crap.

214
00:15:42,548 --> 00:15:45,552
Oh right. He can't make it to Zurich, right?

215
00:15:45,586 --> 00:15:49,480
That's kind of what I'm here for. Do you really need the biggest crap record?

216
00:15:49,505 --> 00:15:53,091
Could you maybe see your way to just letting my dad have this one?

217
00:15:53,506 --> 00:15:56,360
Let him have it? Why would I do that?!

218
00:15:56,397 --> 00:16:01,371
Look, you gotta understand, sir. My dad's never won an award for anything. Ever.

219
00:16:01,406 --> 00:16:03,450
He doesn't have one single trophy.

220
00:16:03,487 --> 00:16:08,411
I mean, even I have a second-place trophy for most Sports Illustrated subscriptions sold.

221
00:16:08,447 --> 00:16:11,012
I have the first-place trophy for that.

222
00:16:12,295 --> 00:16:14,391
Dude, don't you have enough? I mean...

223
00:16:14,436 --> 00:16:18,211
you got tons of money, a jet and the biggest rock band in the world, a hot wife and...

224
00:16:18,217 --> 00:16:22,960
you've been knighted. I mean, at some point, can't you just kind of fuck off?

225
00:16:22,995 --> 00:16:26,582
I want people to know that I'm worth something. That I matter.

226
00:16:26,607 --> 00:16:30,691
All I'm asking is that maybe with this one thing, let my dad be number 1.

227
00:16:30,717 --> 00:16:32,822
And you can still be number 2.

228
00:16:33,386 --> 00:16:36,980
Number two?! Number two?!

229
00:16:37,686 --> 00:16:40,380
Nobody calls me that anymore and gets away with it!

230
00:16:40,415 --> 00:16:44,372
Take it back! Take it back! - I take it back!

231
00:16:44,408 --> 00:16:46,932
Say I'm not number two! - You're not number two!

232
00:16:46,966 --> 00:16:49,481
That's right! I'm not!

233
00:16:54,225 --> 00:16:56,133
What is wrong with that guy?

234
00:16:56,166 --> 00:16:59,880
Your father is in grave danger. Come with me!

235
00:17:16,135 --> 00:17:18,470
It must be quite a crap.

236
00:17:18,508 --> 00:17:21,650
Come on, Randy. You have to push!

237
00:17:26,957 --> 00:17:29,352
What are you saying?! How do you know my dad is gonna die?!

238
00:17:29,387 --> 00:17:32,563
Because nobody has ever taken a crap that big before!

239
00:17:32,595 --> 00:17:34,621
So Bono's newest record is a lie!

240
00:17:34,658 --> 00:17:39,710
Look, I first knew something was wrong when I looked at Bono's first award for biggest crap.

241
00:17:39,755 --> 00:17:43,073
It said he took it in 1960. - So?

242
00:17:43,098 --> 00:17:47,940
So that's the year Bono was born. Then it all made sense to me.

243
00:17:47,978 --> 00:17:52,861
How could Bono be so talented, so caring and yet seem like such a piece of crap?

244
00:17:52,888 --> 00:17:59,261
Because he is crap. Don't you get it? Bono is not the record holder...

245
00:18:00,465 --> 00:18:03,543
He's the record. - Yes.

246
00:18:08,386 --> 00:18:11,193
I can't do it! I can't do it!

247
00:18:11,208 --> 00:18:15,741
The crap is simply too big, Mr. Marsh. We must perform a Caesarean!

248
00:18:15,777 --> 00:18:18,940
But then, does it still count? - Oh, no!

249
00:18:18,945 --> 00:18:23,760
A biggest crap means you crapped it out! - I believe that's true.

250
00:18:23,785 --> 00:18:28,083
We are sorry, Mr. Marsh, but if you cannot crap out the crap...

251
00:18:28,106 --> 00:18:30,260
it's not really a crap.

252
00:18:30,958 --> 00:18:33,840
No... No.

253
00:18:34,255 --> 00:18:37,743
There there Randy. You gave it your best shot.

254
00:18:37,777 --> 00:18:41,230
I want my wife. Sharon? Sharon?

255
00:18:41,947 --> 00:18:44,971
What?! - I'm sorry, Sharon.

256
00:18:45,007 --> 00:18:49,891
I'm sorry that I let you down. I'm sorry I can't crap like Bono.

257
00:18:50,466 --> 00:18:54,591
Well congratulations, Bono, it appears your record is intact.

258
00:18:54,628 --> 00:18:58,101
I had a feeling it would be. - Wait! Stop!

259
00:18:58,137 --> 00:19:02,891
Dad, your old crap counts. Bono never took a second crap to beat yours.

260
00:19:02,926 --> 00:19:06,581
Get him out of here! - What are you talking about, young man?

261
00:19:06,617 --> 00:19:12,332
Somebody's been keeping it a secret. Bono was never the record holder! He's the record!

262
00:19:13,026 --> 00:19:17,172
It's not true! Kill the kid! I want him dead!

263
00:19:17,426 --> 00:19:21,793
It's too late, Bono. The boy has learned the truth.

264
00:19:21,827 --> 00:19:26,693
Herr Broloff, what do you know of this? - It's true, I'm afraid.

265
00:19:26,727 --> 00:19:32,301
You see, until Mr. Marsh came along, I was the record holder for the biggest crap.

266
00:19:32,337 --> 00:19:37,293
I took it back in 1960. It was the most amazing crap I'd ever taken.

267
00:19:37,328 --> 00:19:40,461
Poppa no! Say nothing more!

268
00:19:40,656 --> 00:19:43,902
Come to me, my darling precious child.

269
00:19:49,376 --> 00:19:52,670
After I had broken the record I took the crap home.

270
00:19:52,705 --> 00:19:58,133
I was so proud of it that I decided to keep it, to try and raise it like a child.

271
00:19:58,165 --> 00:20:02,871
No Poppa. No Poppa. - There there, my little crap.

272
00:20:02,907 --> 00:20:06,781
Don't cry. Here, do you want the biddy?

273
00:20:07,557 --> 00:20:09,811
Does Bono want the biddy?

274
00:20:11,618 --> 00:20:14,181
Yes, he likes the biddy doesn't he?

275
00:20:14,996 --> 00:20:16,080
Dude.

276
00:20:16,105 --> 00:20:19,990
I kept the crap in my office, nursed it, fed it biddy.

277
00:20:20,035 --> 00:20:23,711
And soon biddy made him strong. Biddy made him grow up!

278
00:20:23,756 --> 00:20:28,773
Into one of the most influential figures of our time.Easy Bono, that hurts the biddy.

279
00:20:29,315 --> 00:20:30,631
Biddy.

280
00:20:31,767 --> 00:20:34,531
My little crap has accomplished many things.

281
00:20:34,567 --> 00:20:38,980
But he could never shed the fact that he was really a number two.

282
00:20:39,015 --> 00:20:42,940
So he spent his life trying to be number one, in everything.

283
00:20:42,987 --> 00:20:46,262
That's why he's able to do so much, try to help so many people...

284
00:20:46,297 --> 00:20:48,763
but still seem like such a piece of shit.

285
00:20:48,805 --> 00:20:51,860
You have blemished this noble society's good name, Herr Broloff.

286
00:20:51,895 --> 00:20:55,531
Have I?! Look at the crap I took all those years ago!

287
00:20:55,568 --> 00:20:59,740
Bono is now almost six feet tall and over 80 Courics in weight!

288
00:20:59,776 --> 00:21:03,762
No matter how you look at it, he is still the record!

289
00:21:03,796 --> 00:21:07,192
Oh God, here it comes! Oh, hot, hot, hot, hot!

290
00:21:07,228 --> 00:21:10,452
Hot, hot, hot, hot, hot! Hot! Hot!

291
00:21:16,737 --> 00:21:20,981
My God... - It must be over a hundred Courics!

292
00:21:21,167 --> 00:21:23,741
Dad, are you all right? - Yeah, I'm...

293
00:21:23,775 --> 00:21:26,631
No, I'm good! Feel a lot better.

294
00:21:26,665 --> 00:21:30,441
Mr. Marsh, we apologize and if it's okay with you...

295
00:21:30,478 --> 00:21:34,910
we would like to present you... your long overdue trophy.
