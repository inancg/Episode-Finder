<i>I'm going out to South Park
gonna have myself a time</i>

4
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:14,415
<i>Friendly faces everywhere
humble folks without temptation</i>

00:00:14,446 --> 00:00:17,762
<i>I'm goin out to south park
gonna leave my woes behind</i>

00:00:17,793 --> 00:00:21,022
<i>Ample parking day or night
people spouting howdy neighbor</i>

7
00:00:21,054 --> 00:00:24,263
<i>I'm heading out to south park
to see if i cant unwind</i>

8
00:00:24,294 --> 00:00:27,615
<i>I like girls with big fat titties
really big fat titties</i>

9
00:00:27,646 --> 00:00:31,121
<i>So come on out to south park
and meet some friends of mine</i>

10
00:00:32,505 --> 00:00:35,296
<i>Previously on Battlestar Galactica...</i>

11
00:00:35,322 --> 00:00:39,554
What is this place?
- This is Imaginationland.

12
00:00:39,586 --> 00:00:41,888
Allah!

13
00:00:43,364 --> 00:00:46,251
We have to get out of here!
- Hold on, fellas!

14
00:00:46,252 --> 00:00:47,807
Butters!

15
00:00:48,123 --> 00:00:52,282
Terrorists have just attacked...
our imagination.

16
00:00:52,314 --> 00:00:54,401
If the terrorists blow that barrier,

17
00:00:54,402 --> 00:00:57,827
all the most evil things ever imagined
are gonna pour out!

18
00:00:57,843 --> 00:01:00,397
Allah!
- No!

19
00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:06,062
Episode II

20
00:01:10,751 --> 00:01:13,510
<i>Butters, time for breakfast.</i>

21
00:01:15,483 --> 00:01:18,274
Oh jeez, it was just a dream.

22
00:01:18,305 --> 00:01:21,497
Come on, Butters. Mom's cooked
waffles and nanas for you.

23
00:01:21,528 --> 00:01:26,517
Mom, Dad, I dreamt I was in Imaginationland
and terrorists attacked it.

24
00:01:26,533 --> 00:01:30,371
You are in Imaginationland.
This is a dream.

25
00:01:30,410 --> 00:01:35,087
Hey, wake up, stupid!
Come on, wake up, kid!

26
00:01:36,068 --> 00:01:41,179
No, wait! I was back home in bed!
- No! You passed out and peed your pants!

27
00:01:41,210 --> 00:01:44,858
Look! The evil of Imaginationland
is coming out!

28
00:01:59,856 --> 00:02:01,795
Oh hamburgers!

29
00:02:04,618 --> 00:02:08,019
Everyone! Fall back to the Gumdrop Forest!

30
00:02:08,050 --> 00:02:11,522
Come with me, little boy!
I'm going to get you home!

31
00:02:12,492 --> 00:02:14,250
It's Alien!

32
00:02:19,628 --> 00:02:21,095
Predator!

33
00:02:33,035 --> 00:02:35,241
Look, we already told you everything we know.

34
00:02:35,242 --> 00:02:38,307
Some guy just showed up in a big balloon
and took us into Imaginationland.

35
00:02:38,324 --> 00:02:40,262
What we want to know is how!

36
00:02:40,263 --> 00:02:44,903
We need to find a way into Imaginationland,
you've been there! How did you do it?!

37
00:02:44,925 --> 00:02:47,301
We just went on a balloon ride.

38
00:02:47,339 --> 00:02:49,917
There must have been some kind
of portal or doorway.

39
00:02:49,933 --> 00:02:51,256
Dude, we don't remember.

40
00:02:51,257 --> 00:02:53,242
Do you realize what's going on here?!

41
00:02:53,243 --> 00:02:58,328
Terrorists have attacked our imagination
and now our imaginations are running wild!

42
00:02:58,359 --> 00:03:02,649
You'd better start remembering!
- It was the Chinese, wasn't it?

43
00:03:03,112 --> 00:03:03,807
What?

44
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:07,578
We've suspected that the Chinese government
was working on a doorway to the imagination.

45
00:03:07,579 --> 00:03:09,723
Is that where you were?!
- No.

46
00:03:09,739 --> 00:03:13,336
That's it, isn't it?! Where do the Chinese
keep this portal? How does it work?

47
00:03:13,352 --> 00:03:16,550
It it better than ours?
- Your what?

48
00:03:16,582 --> 00:03:21,179
Our portal to the imagination built as a secret
project back in 1962 to fight the Soviets-

49
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:25,833
Tom! That's super-secret.
- Oh, I'm sorry sir.

50
00:03:26,685 --> 00:03:29,923
Wait. The U.S. Government has
a portal to the imagination?

51
00:03:29,954 --> 00:03:34,423
Aw, see? Good job, Tom! Why don't you
just tell them everything about Project X?!

52
00:03:34,447 --> 00:03:36,685
Yes sir. We built a portal to the imagination

53
00:03:36,686 --> 00:03:39,250
to use against the Russians durin
the Cold War, but we never got a-

54
00:03:39,251 --> 00:03:42,789
That was sarcasm. I was
being sarcastic, you fucking idiot?!

55
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:44,587
Aw jeez, I'm really sorry sir.

56
00:03:44,618 --> 00:03:47,758
If you already built a doorway to
the imagination, then why do you need us?

57
00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:51,448
All right, we might as well show it to them.
Goddamnit, Tom.

58
00:03:52,702 --> 00:03:55,367
<i>Every night, the dream is the same</i>

59
00:03:56,143 --> 00:03:58,644
<i>I'm on my way to visit my friend Kyle</i>

60
00:03:58,675 --> 00:04:01,607
<i>because we had a bet that if I could
prove leprechauns were real</i>

61
00:04:01,608 --> 00:04:03,784
<i>he would suck my balls</i>

62
00:04:03,958 --> 00:04:06,607
<i>And it turns out I was right</i>

63
00:04:07,399 --> 00:04:10,127
Time to pay up, Kyle.

64
00:04:11,106 --> 00:04:12,919
<i>But then...</i>

65
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,492
No!

66
00:04:17,998 --> 00:04:19,583
No!

67
00:04:20,324 --> 00:04:23,636
<i>It's been taken from me
I have dry balls</i>

68
00:04:23,667 --> 00:04:27,248
<i>Balls so dry they explode like dust</i>

69
00:04:32,675 --> 00:04:37,144
You okay, kid?
- No. I've got dry balls.

70
00:04:37,176 --> 00:04:39,147
And I'm running out of time.

71
00:04:51,915 --> 00:04:56,781
Ever since the Cold War, the U.S. Government
has been working on a secret project...

72
00:04:56,782 --> 00:05:03,639
to build a doorway into the imagination.
It is called "Project Imagination Doorway."

73
00:05:05,158 --> 00:05:07,145
That's not very imaginative.

74
00:05:07,956 --> 00:05:14,387
According to all the tests and the data,
the doorway should work, but it never has.

75
00:05:14,418 --> 00:05:16,904
But we're close, sir. We're real close.

76
00:05:16,935 --> 00:05:19,135
They've been saying that for
over forty years.

77
00:05:19,136 --> 00:05:22,821
You're the ones, right? The kids
who have been in the imagination.

78
00:05:22,852 --> 00:05:25,814
Ah, I guess.
- What was the sequence that got you inside?

79
00:05:25,846 --> 00:05:29,042
We know there's some kind of resonance code,
but we can't figure it out.

80
00:05:29,074 --> 00:05:31,498
Look, we're sorry, you guys,
but the balloon just went up in the air

81
00:05:31,499 --> 00:05:33,895
and the dude sang a song
and we were suddenly there.

82
00:05:33,927 --> 00:05:36,389
Song? You didn't say anything
about a song before.

83
00:05:36,421 --> 00:05:39,417
What song?
- The Imagination song?

84
00:05:39,448 --> 00:05:40,622
That could be it.

85
00:05:40,638 --> 00:05:43,959
The fractal converter has never worked,
because it was waiting for a multitonal code!

86
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:46,799
Quick boys, how does the Imagination Song go?

87
00:05:48,178 --> 00:05:51,520
Imagination.

88
00:05:51,551 --> 00:05:54,484
Imagination.

89
00:05:54,516 --> 00:05:56,961
Sir, I'm getting some electrofeedback
from the gate.

90
00:05:56,962 --> 00:06:00,096
It's weak, but it's nanoresponding
to something.

91
00:06:00,112 --> 00:06:03,926
Was there more to the Imagination Song?
How does the rest of it go?

92
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:07,834
Imagination.

93
00:06:09,774 --> 00:06:11,670
No, no dude, it went up there.

94
00:06:14,745 --> 00:06:16,953
Dude, we don't remember.
It was really long and stupid.

95
00:06:16,968 --> 00:06:20,173
I'm just about through playing with you boys!
We're running out of time!

96
00:06:20,174 --> 00:06:24,006
You have to remember that song
in its entirety!

97
00:06:27,998 --> 00:06:30,395
Mayor, what are we supposed to do?

98
00:06:30,411 --> 00:06:33,650
Please, sir. I have to get home to my world.

99
00:06:33,682 --> 00:06:39,408
Oh, well. All you have to do is tap
your heels together three times.

100
00:06:39,439 --> 00:06:43,923
Really?
- No, you fucking dipshit, that was a joke!

101
00:06:45,395 --> 00:06:48,423
Mayor, what are we supposed to do,
snarf snarf?

102
00:06:48,455 --> 00:06:53,381
Get to Castle Sunshine! It's your only hope!
- Castle Sunshine?

103
00:06:53,412 --> 00:06:58,151
Through the Gumdrop Forest.
Others will be hiding there. Go, run!

104
00:06:58,183 --> 00:07:03,390
Look out for the evil characters!
They're assembling on the Yum Yum mountain!

105
00:07:05,088 --> 00:07:09,664
We are free!
Now all of Imaginationland is ours!

106
00:07:09,696 --> 00:07:15,814
Not all, foolish orc! There are still parts
of Imaginationland we don't comtrol.

107
00:07:15,845 --> 00:07:20,071
Tomorrow, we shall build our
own castle right on this spot!

108
00:07:20,103 --> 00:07:25,440
Who put you in charge, Krueger?!
I am the most evil character here!

109
00:07:25,472 --> 00:07:28,787
Nonsense!
Your evil is stale.

110
00:07:28,818 --> 00:07:32,571
I am the most evil imaginary character!

111
00:07:34,455 --> 00:07:38,295
Now come on y'all. We shouldn't be fighting,
we're supposed to all be on the same side.

112
00:07:38,326 --> 00:07:40,916
Yeah. You're all right, Squirrelly Squirrel.

113
00:07:40,947 --> 00:07:42,994
Yeah!

114
00:07:43,105 --> 00:07:45,801
What evil imaginary characters are they?

115
00:07:45,817 --> 00:07:50,020
They were dreamt up by some fourth grade
kid as part of his Christmas Story.

116
00:07:50,052 --> 00:07:54,044
Now come on y'all. We can't waste time arguing,
there could still be survivors out there.

117
00:07:54,076 --> 00:07:57,434
We need to hunt them down and kill them.
- And eat their flesh!

118
00:07:57,465 --> 00:08:01,311
But first we should rape them!
- How about we kill them.

119
00:08:01,312 --> 00:08:05,494
And then rape their bodies so we
can use their blood as lubricant?

120
00:08:05,526 --> 00:08:08,443
Say, that's a great idea, Beary Bear.

121
00:08:11,623 --> 00:08:15,597
Man, I do not want to meet the kid
that dreamt those things up.

122
00:08:16,191 --> 00:08:19,486
Look, I want some goddamn answers!
You brought my friend here to Washington!

123
00:08:19,487 --> 00:08:21,332
Where is he?! What is going on?!

124
00:08:21,348 --> 00:08:24,049
I'm sorry, sir.
That information is classified.

125
00:08:24,081 --> 00:08:26,813
Something is going on and I have
a right to know where my friend is!

126
00:08:26,829 --> 00:08:29,601
There's somebody asking a lot of
questions about what's going on.

127
00:08:29,632 --> 00:08:30,957
Let me handle this!

128
00:08:30,988 --> 00:08:36,396
I'm sorry, but there is no such thing
as Project Imagination Doorway!

129
00:08:36,736 --> 00:08:38,171
Imagination Doorway.

130
00:08:38,186 --> 00:08:42,299
It was started in the Sixties as
a secret government project. Right.

131
00:08:42,504 --> 00:08:45,726
Imagination...

132
00:08:45,757 --> 00:08:49,380
Wait, maybe that's where he went really
flat, like that half-step key change?

133
00:08:49,412 --> 00:08:51,383
Imagination.

134
00:08:51,414 --> 00:08:54,253
Right, then it was:
Imagination...

135
00:08:54,254 --> 00:08:55,674
Imagination...

136
00:08:55,675 --> 00:08:58,135
Imagination...

137
00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:05,030
It's open! It's open!

138
00:09:05,061 --> 00:09:08,408
Getting readings from the other side,
that's it.

139
00:09:08,439 --> 00:09:11,293
We've made an opening to
our imagination, sir!

140
00:09:14,289 --> 00:09:17,774
All right, that's enough! We've still
got a lot of work to do, people!

141
00:09:17,805 --> 00:09:23,565
It's time to go in and get our
imaginations under control!

142
00:09:26,335 --> 00:09:28,889
How much further to Castle Sunshine?

143
00:09:28,921 --> 00:09:33,191
Snarf, I'm not sure, snarf snarf.
I've never been.

144
00:09:34,545 --> 00:09:37,083
What was that?
- Over here.

145
00:09:38,658 --> 00:09:41,433
Oh Christ. It's Strawberry Shortcake.

146
00:09:44,130 --> 00:09:46,354
Please, let me go.

147
00:09:52,846 --> 00:09:55,101
Oh my God! Snarf.

148
00:09:57,950 --> 00:09:59,937
Now kill her!

149
00:09:59,969 --> 00:10:03,866
Hang on, y'all. You can't just kill her.
That's not evil enough.

150
00:10:03,897 --> 00:10:07,753
What do you mean? We cut out her eyeball.
- Yeah, that's super hardcore.

151
00:10:07,785 --> 00:10:10,087
Now come on y'all.
We can do better than that.

152
00:10:10,119 --> 00:10:13,695
Hey! I know! Let's all pee in
her empty eye socket!

153
00:10:13,726 --> 00:10:17,132
Let's make her eat her own eyeball
and then pee in her empty eyesocket.

154
00:10:17,164 --> 00:10:23,006
How about we get someone with AIDS to pee
in her eyesocket, so she dies all slowlike?

155
00:10:24,993 --> 00:10:27,295
Nobody here has AIDS!

156
00:10:28,805 --> 00:10:32,321
But we've got to have AIDS before
we pee in her eyesocket!

157
00:10:32,353 --> 00:10:35,794
Now don't be down y'all. I bet we can
find some AIDS out in the forest.

158
00:10:38,306 --> 00:10:40,561
Dude, run, run, run!

159
00:10:48,136 --> 00:10:52,378
All right, men. We don't know what you'll
experience on the other side of this doorway,

160
00:10:52,409 --> 00:10:55,233
but it will most likely be really weird.

161
00:10:55,265 --> 00:11:00,264
If you reach our imagination, you are to take
every step necessary to get it under control!

162
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:01,809
Are you ready?
- Yes sir!

163
00:11:01,825 --> 00:11:03,918
Are you ready, Kurt Russell?

164
00:11:03,950 --> 00:11:07,707
I don't understand why I'm here.
I'm just an actor.

165
00:11:07,738 --> 00:11:10,281
Yes, but you were in that one movie
that was kinda like this.

166
00:11:10,282 --> 00:11:15,787
That gives you more experience than anybody.
All right, here we go! Men! Forward!

167
00:11:15,819 --> 00:11:17,965
Sir, we have a security breach!
- What?!

168
00:11:17,996 --> 00:11:21,080
There's an Unauthorized Entry Alert!
It's coming from Sector Two!

169
00:11:21,111 --> 00:11:23,540
Sector Two?

170
00:11:25,610 --> 00:11:27,329
Cartman?

171
00:11:28,329 --> 00:11:31,459
Hello Kyle! Thought you could get
out of your responsibilities, huh?!

172
00:11:31,474 --> 00:11:32,577
Who the hell are you?!

173
00:11:32,578 --> 00:11:35,754
That kid you have made a bit that if
I could prove that I saw a leprechaun,

174
00:11:35,755 --> 00:11:37,143
he would suck my balls!

175
00:11:37,167 --> 00:11:38,815
Get him out of here!

176
00:11:38,838 --> 00:11:43,736
No! Hold on a second! I have a contract
validatd by the United States court system!

177
00:11:43,768 --> 00:11:45,581
Let me see that!

178
00:11:48,357 --> 00:11:51,353
Why would you agree to suck someone's balls?

179
00:11:51,385 --> 00:11:53,656
I didn't think there was going to
be a goddamned leprechaun!

180
00:11:53,671 --> 00:11:57,357
All right, you two can go use the conference
room. Go on, we have work to do here.

181
00:11:57,389 --> 00:11:59,674
Well wait, I wanna see what happens here!

182
00:11:59,675 --> 00:12:03,680
You signed an agreement, kid. We don't
have time for this. Go on and do it.

183
00:12:04,658 --> 00:12:07,672
Stan?
- Dude, you did make a deal.

184
00:12:10,148 --> 00:12:12,766
The conference room is which way?

185
00:12:13,595 --> 00:12:18,909
Here we are, Kyle. You tried to bail
out on our agreement, but I found you.

186
00:12:18,941 --> 00:12:22,101
I didn't bail, I got picked up by
the governmemt!

187
00:12:22,132 --> 00:12:25,100
Well we're here now, that's all that matters.

188
00:12:25,132 --> 00:12:30,231
Care for some nuts? Oh, that's right. I guess
you'll be chock full of nuts in a few minutes.

189
00:12:30,263 --> 00:12:32,170
Cartman, do you even know what's going on?

190
00:12:32,171 --> 00:12:34,752
We went to Imaginationland,
terrorists attacked it

191
00:12:34,753 --> 00:12:37,686
and now the government is about to-

192
00:12:38,417 --> 00:12:41,759
Oh jeez, I'm sorry, Kyle. It's just that
I'm so completely bored by this story.

193
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:44,029
See, I'm really only interested in
the part where the leprechaun was real,

194
00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:46,522
and so you have to suck my balls.

195
00:12:46,554 --> 00:12:49,037
Okay, fine. You know what?
Let's just get it over with!

196
00:12:49,069 --> 00:12:51,576
Oh no, not so fast, Kyle.

197
00:12:51,608 --> 00:12:56,263
I've waited a long time for this and I
intend to savor each and every second.

198
00:12:56,294 --> 00:12:59,616
No, I'm serious! I wanna see what's
happening downstairs, so let's just do it!

199
00:12:59,648 --> 00:13:03,444
Not just yet, Kyle. There's still
a few things I need to do.

200
00:13:03,479 --> 00:13:06,984
By the way, I should tell you that I haven't had
a chance to shower while making my way up here.

201
00:13:07,016 --> 00:13:09,905
My balls are extra vinegary.

202
00:13:10,781 --> 00:13:12,241
Just get to it already!

203
00:13:14,545 --> 00:13:16,957
Entering the portal in five seconds.

204
00:13:16,989 --> 00:13:21,465
Kurt Russell, can I get a comm check?
- Check 1, 2.

205
00:13:21,497 --> 00:13:24,433
Good luck men! Godspeed!

206
00:13:42,106 --> 00:13:45,709
What do we have?!
Kurt Russell, can you hear me?

207
00:13:45,804 --> 00:13:48,815
<i>We're here. We're somewhere.</i>

208
00:13:48,849 --> 00:13:52,640
They are inside the imagination, sir.
- What do you see in there?

209
00:13:52,672 --> 00:13:58,646
<i>There's lots of big mushrooms, colorful
grass, some castles in the distance.</i>

210
00:13:58,677 --> 00:14:02,471
<i>Wait. Something's coming for us!</i>

211
00:14:02,618 --> 00:14:05,713
<i>It's coming out of the bushes and-</i>

212
00:14:07,340 --> 00:14:13,135
<i>Oh, it's just a cute little squirrel.
Hey, it talks. The little squirrel talks.</i>

213
00:14:13,167 --> 00:14:17,055
Aw, an imaginary talking squirrel.

214
00:14:17,087 --> 00:14:19,991
Ask the squirrel what it knows about
the terrorist attack.

215
00:14:20,023 --> 00:14:25,921
<i>Wait a minute. The squirrel has friends.
Why it's a whold bunch of Woodland ritters.</i>

216
00:14:25,951 --> 00:14:27,555
Wait, Woodland critters?

217
00:14:27,556 --> 00:14:30,186
<i>There's a talking bear and a beaver.</i>

218
00:14:30,217 --> 00:14:35,009
<i>They seem to be Christmas critters.
Well hello. Yes, hi.</i>

219
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,596
Get them out of there!
- What?

220
00:14:36,612 --> 00:14:40,266
Tell them to get away now!
- What's the matter?

221
00:14:40,362 --> 00:14:43,219
<i>The cute little bear's eyes are starting
to glow red now.</i>

222
00:14:43,251 --> 00:14:46,813
<i>Hello there, little animals, do you
happen to know how to huh?</i>

223
00:14:49,434 --> 00:14:51,243
Kurt Russell, what's going on?!

224
00:14:51,244 --> 00:14:55,866
<i>They're raping me! They're raping me!</i>

225
00:14:55,897 --> 00:14:57,562
Get out of there, Kurt Russell!

226
00:14:57,563 --> 00:15:01,959
<i>They're raping all of us! Oh, it hurts!</i>

227
00:15:01,991 --> 00:15:05,562
<i>They're raping us and it hurts!</i>

228
00:15:09,157 --> 00:15:12,554
I was thinking of using a high-speed shutter
with a low depth of field. What do you think?

229
00:15:12,570 --> 00:15:15,826
Goddamnit Cartman, will you stop
wasting time? I wanna get this over with!

230
00:15:15,858 --> 00:15:16,934
No, you're right, Kyle.

231
00:15:16,935 --> 00:15:19,602
A higher depth of field will make
sure everything stays in focus.

232
00:15:19,634 --> 00:15:21,046
There we go.

233
00:15:22,677 --> 00:15:25,128
Now, Kyle, when you're sucking my balls,

234
00:15:25,129 --> 00:15:27,607
are you gonna think about how right
I was about the leprechaun?

235
00:15:27,621 --> 00:15:31,147
Or are you just gonna try and focus on how
rough and salty my balls feel in your mouth?

236
00:15:31,177 --> 00:15:32,893
Let's just do it!

237
00:15:32,923 --> 00:15:36,064
In time, Kyle. You certainly are eager
for balls, aren't you?

238
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:38,128
Are you ball-famished? Balls-starving?

239
00:15:38,159 --> 00:15:40,761
You see, Kyle, I wonder if at
this moment you are actually-

240
00:15:42,019 --> 00:15:46,101
Everyone to the main hall now! Go!
- No, we're not done in here yet.

241
00:15:46,133 --> 00:15:50,797
Everyone to the main hall now!
- No! Goddamnit, no!

242
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:57,364
Boy snarf snarf, my feet
are really getting tired snarf.

243
00:15:57,395 --> 00:16:00,714
Aw, Snarf, could you maybe
like shut up for five minutes?

244
00:16:00,746 --> 00:16:03,466
Wait! There it is. We made it!

245
00:16:03,498 --> 00:16:05,514
Castle Sunshine!

246
00:16:05,546 --> 00:16:07,577
Yeah!

247
00:16:09,611 --> 00:16:10,912
Hurry! Get inside!

248
00:16:10,913 --> 00:16:13,261
The evil imaginary characters
are approaching!

249
00:16:13,262 --> 00:16:15,762
Lock down the gates!
Prepare to fire the cannons!

250
00:16:15,794 --> 00:16:18,143
Wait! Wait!

251
00:16:18,667 --> 00:16:23,475
What imaginary character are you?!
- The Lollipop King? From the Lollipop Forest?

252
00:16:23,507 --> 00:16:27,094
And I'm Snarf. Snarf, snarf snarf snarf.

253
00:16:27,126 --> 00:16:32,911
And what imaginary character are you?
- I'm not imaginary. I'm Butters.

254
00:16:32,943 --> 00:16:34,116
What's a "Butters"?

255
00:16:34,117 --> 00:16:36,966
The Mayor brought him and some
other kids into Imaginationland...

256
00:16:36,967 --> 00:16:38,792
just before the terrorist attack.

257
00:16:38,824 --> 00:16:42,839
So you came from the real world at
precisely the same time as the terrorists!

258
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:45,333
That seems like quite a coincidence!

259
00:16:45,364 --> 00:16:48,480
Well I was just playing with my friends
and then we caught a leprechaun

260
00:16:48,481 --> 00:16:51,390
and then this guy-
- You caught the leprechaun? Take him!

261
00:16:51,422 --> 00:16:54,298
Perseus! He's not against us, snarf snarf!

262
00:16:58,080 --> 00:17:00,668
Talk to me! What's going on?!

263
00:17:00,699 --> 00:17:04,525
Something is coming through
the gate from the other side.

264
00:17:09,575 --> 00:17:13,782
What is it?!
- It's like a half man half bear!

265
00:17:13,813 --> 00:17:15,829
And half pig!

266
00:17:16,913 --> 00:17:22,151
Oh! No, no wait!
It's like a half bear, half manpig!

267
00:17:23,612 --> 00:17:25,256
Look out!

268
00:17:25,558 --> 00:17:30,251
No! I think it's more like a half man
and half pigbear!

269
00:17:30,282 --> 00:17:33,282
Reverse the doorway!
Send it back through!

270
00:17:35,864 --> 00:17:37,356
Kyle!

271
00:17:58,018 --> 00:18:01,914
Please! I didn't help the terrorists
get into Imaginationland! Honest!

272
00:18:01,945 --> 00:18:04,517
That is for the Council of Nine to decide!

273
00:18:04,548 --> 00:18:06,992
Don't worry, kid,
the Council of Nine consists of some

274
00:18:06,993 --> 00:18:11,898
of the most highly-regarded imaginary
characters in all Imaginationland.

275
00:18:12,088 --> 00:18:15,271
Fellow Council, these are indeed dark times.

276
00:18:15,303 --> 00:18:20,931
The evil forces amass at our gates as we
speak. Zeus believes we should evacuate.

277
00:18:20,963 --> 00:18:26,080
Yes. Their power outmatches ours. If they are
giving us a chance to leave we must take it!

278
00:18:26,096 --> 00:18:28,379
And what say you, Morpheus?

279
00:18:28,411 --> 00:18:32,683
How our we to know that they will let
us go? Their offer could be a trap.

280
00:18:32,715 --> 00:18:37,382
Perhaps we must flee to the Temple of Alderon.
Surely they wouldn't chase us there.

281
00:18:37,413 --> 00:18:40,779
No, we can't. Come on, you guys,
this is our home.

282
00:18:40,780 --> 00:18:44,097
We have to fight, to keep it the way
it was meant to be.

283
00:18:44,130 --> 00:18:47,545
I'm with Jesus. The evil characters
aren't going to just us go.

284
00:18:50,688 --> 00:18:54,784
That may be, Popeye,
but we don't have a choice!

285
00:18:55,897 --> 00:19:01,119
Forgive my intrusion, Council of Nine, but
this boy has infiltrated from the real world.

286
00:19:01,452 --> 00:19:03,135
Bring him here!

287
00:19:06,097 --> 00:19:07,621
Clear!

288
00:19:12,551 --> 00:19:15,488
I'm sorry. He's gone.

289
00:19:17,436 --> 00:19:21,880
No! Kyle can't die.
- I'm sorry, young man.

290
00:19:23,615 --> 00:19:25,281
Kyle?

291
00:19:25,758 --> 00:19:30,749
Well at least now he doesn't have
to suck anyone's balls.

292
00:19:31,783 --> 00:19:33,513
No!

293
00:19:33,544 --> 00:19:36,100
No, he has a strong heart!
He wants to live!

294
00:19:36,132 --> 00:19:38,844
Come on, Kyle! Come on, buddy!

295
00:19:40,623 --> 00:19:42,670
He's gone, little boy.

296
00:19:42,702 --> 00:19:45,197
Zap him again! Do it!
- Charging.

297
00:19:45,198 --> 00:19:46,421
Do it!

298
00:19:48,460 --> 00:19:50,984
Come on buddy.
- Clear.

299
00:19:54,236 --> 00:19:55,839
Get out of here!

300
00:19:59,250 --> 00:20:03,044
Godamnit Kyle, you never walked away
from anything in your life! Now fight!

301
00:20:03,075 --> 00:20:06,566
Fight! Fight! Right now!

302
00:20:06,598 --> 00:20:10,296
Fight! Fight!

303
00:20:19,816 --> 00:20:21,705
Give him some air.

304
00:20:21,737 --> 00:20:24,260
There, easy. Breathe easy.

305
00:20:28,463 --> 00:20:33,082
I believe this child was brought into
Imaginationland for a reason.

306
00:20:33,114 --> 00:20:35,478
Perhaps the Mayor knew something we don't.

307
00:20:35,479 --> 00:20:38,893
What are you saying, Aslan? That if we
are to take back control, we might-?

308
00:20:38,894 --> 00:20:43,066
Yes. If we are to take back
control from the evil forces,

309
00:20:43,098 --> 00:20:45,844
this little boy might be the key.

310
00:20:45,875 --> 00:20:47,469
Aw, I'm the key?

311
00:20:47,470 --> 00:20:50,538
Could I not be the key, Morpheus?
I don't wanna be the key.

312
00:20:50,570 --> 00:20:52,839
If you ever wanna see your home
again, little boy,

313
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:54,650
you'll have to rise to this challenge.

314
00:20:54,681 --> 00:20:57,014
But I'm supposed to be at school right now.

315
00:20:57,015 --> 00:21:00,664
And instead I got Snarf and Popeye
and Luke Skywalker all pissed off.

316
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:03,599
It is a dark time for all of us, young boy.

317
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:09,468
But know that if you believe in yourself,
everything will turn out all right.

318
00:21:15,894 --> 00:21:20,069
Sir? Are you sure about this?
- We have no choice.

319
00:21:20,108 --> 00:21:25,568
Terrorists have attacked us where we are
most vulnerable. There's no other option.

320
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:28,990
We have to nuke our imagination.

321
00:21:38,182 --> 00:21:39,942
Wake up, Kyle.

322
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:43,400
