"Guitar Queer-O"</i>

3
00:00:06,780 --> 00:00:10,039
<i>I'm going out to South Park
gonna have myself a time</i>

4
00:00:10,070 --> 00:00:13,445
<i>Friendly faces everywhere
humble folks without temptation</i>

5
00:00:13,476 --> 00:00:16,792
<i>I'm goin out to south park
gonna leave my woes behind</i>

6
00:00:16,823 --> 00:00:20,052
<i>Ample parking day or night
people spouting howdy neighbor</i>

7
00:00:20,084 --> 00:00:23,293
<i>I'm heading out to south park
to see if i cant unwind</i>

8
00:00:23,324 --> 00:00:26,645
<i>I like girls with big fat titties
really big fat titties</i>

9
00:00:26,676 --> 00:00:30,151
<i>So come on out to south park
and meet some friends of mine</i>

10
00:00:45,476 --> 00:00:47,480
Stan, you guys are good!

11
00:00:52,454 --> 00:00:54,338
Sharon, what are the boys doing?

12
00:00:54,340 --> 00:00:57,560
Oh, Stan and Kyle bought a new video
game together.

13
00:00:57,598 --> 00:01:01,546
They can play guitar now?
- No, they're just little plastic controllers.

14
00:01:01,569 --> 00:01:05,240
You hit the colored buttons and it makes
the guitar track on the game play.

15
00:01:06,125 --> 00:01:09,673
If they spent half the time learning a real
instrument as they do playing that game,

16
00:01:09,678 --> 00:01:13,050
who knows what they could accomplish.
- Hey yeah.

17
00:01:17,886 --> 00:01:21,163
Dude, listen to that video crowd!
They love us!

18
00:01:23,096 --> 00:01:26,820
So you boys like this music, huh?
- Yeah, dude. It's Guitar Hero.

19
00:01:26,826 --> 00:01:28,823
Stan and Kyle are really good at it.

20
00:01:28,837 --> 00:01:32,992
Well you kids wanna see something
really cool? Check this out.

21
00:01:42,257 --> 00:01:45,873
<i>Once, I rose above the noise and confusion.</i>

22
00:01:45,907 --> 00:01:49,581
<i>Just to get a glimpse beyond this illusion.</i>

23
00:01:49,615 --> 00:01:53,251
<i>I was soaring ever higher</i>

24
00:01:53,288 --> 00:01:56,842
<i>but I flew too high.</i>

25
00:01:56,877 --> 00:02:00,233
<i>Though my eyes could see I-
- Dad? Dad! What are you doing?!</i>

26
00:02:00,266 --> 00:02:03,000
I can actually play a lot of these songs
on a real guitar.

27
00:02:03,008 --> 00:02:05,352
You want me to teach you boys how?

28
00:02:06,436 --> 00:02:10,680
That's gay, Mr. Marsh.
- Yeah, that's stupid, Dad.

29
00:02:10,957 --> 00:02:15,421
But this is real.
- Real guitars are for old people.

30
00:02:15,458 --> 00:02:18,831
Do you mind, sir?
We wanna watch Stan and Kyle play.

31
00:02:22,797 --> 00:02:25,793
Alright, let's try to score
60,000 points this time.

32
00:02:45,555 --> 00:02:47,953
Are you ready to rock?

33
00:02:47,996 --> 00:02:52,042
<i>Carry on my wayward son</i>

34
00:02:52,087 --> 00:02:56,072
<i>There'll be peace when you are done</i>

35
00:02:56,245 --> 00:03:00,320
<i>Lay your weary head to rest</i>

36
00:03:00,357 --> 00:03:03,593
<i>Don't you cry no more</i>

37
00:03:13,838 --> 00:03:17,330
Game over! You suck!

38
00:03:26,858 --> 00:03:28,662
They're gonna do it!

39
00:03:28,716 --> 00:03:30,742
Come on, guys, a hundred thousand points!

40
00:03:30,786 --> 00:03:33,160
Cartman, shut up. We're concentrating.

41
00:03:42,305 --> 00:03:45,762
You have broken a hundred thousand points!

42
00:03:45,815 --> 00:03:48,771
You are rock stars!

43
00:03:48,906 --> 00:03:51,091
Dude, we are total rock stars now!

44
00:03:51,125 --> 00:03:55,313
You're not rock stars!
This is just a stupid plastic controller!

45
00:03:55,527 --> 00:03:57,063
Hang on.

46
00:03:58,375 --> 00:04:00,601
Stan Marsh?
- Yeah?

47
00:04:00,646 --> 00:04:03,922
I'm Charles Kincaid,
from the Kincaid Talent Agency?

48
00:04:03,956 --> 00:04:08,152
I just heard you broke a hundred
thousand points on Guitar Hero.

49
00:04:08,187 --> 00:04:10,940
Yeah, we did.
- Well, I'm impressed.

50
00:04:10,966 --> 00:04:14,412
And I'd like to be your manager.
- Wow, really?

51
00:04:15,075 --> 00:04:17,501
Dude! Dude, Kyle, this guy wants to
be our manager!

52
00:04:17,535 --> 00:04:19,560
No way!
- For reals?

53
00:04:19,598 --> 00:04:24,360
Scoring a hundred thousand points is amazing,
but I think with the right label behind you,

54
00:04:24,395 --> 00:04:27,951
you boys could make a million points.
- That'd be awesome!

55
00:04:27,985 --> 00:04:30,952
So, we're in business then?

56
00:04:43,885 --> 00:04:48,320
Well, what do you think?
- I like it. That's these boys playing?

57
00:04:48,357 --> 00:04:49,893
No, that's Kansas.

58
00:04:49,916 --> 00:04:55,891
But these boys scored a hundred thousand
points to it on Expert Level in Co-op Mode.

59
00:04:56,295 --> 00:04:58,923
That's pretty Goddamned impressive.

60
00:05:00,385 --> 00:05:04,711
Alright, we'll sign them to a one-year deal.
- Yes! You did it, boys.

61
00:05:04,745 --> 00:05:08,763
Listen, boys, I'm having a huge celebrity
party at my giant mansion tonight.

62
00:05:08,796 --> 00:05:12,383
Why don't you come by as
my honorary new artists?

63
00:05:12,427 --> 00:05:13,810
Cool!

64
00:05:24,768 --> 00:05:26,380
Wow, this is a huge party.

65
00:05:26,416 --> 00:05:29,451
Oh yes, all the biggest stars in Colorado
are here.

66
00:05:29,475 --> 00:05:32,132
Dude, dude, that's Ron Zappolo
from Channel 4 News!

67
00:05:32,175 --> 00:05:34,901
Wow! Oh, and look over there,
that's that Jake Jabs guy

68
00:05:34,908 --> 00:05:36,811
from American Furniture Warehouse commercials.

69
00:05:36,846 --> 00:05:40,021
Everyone? Everyone, this is Stan and Kyle.

70
00:05:40,046 --> 00:05:43,482
They just broke a hundred thousand points
on Guitar Hero.

71
00:05:45,595 --> 00:05:49,420
Please enjoy yourselves, there's lots
more coke and sex in the house.

72
00:05:49,728 --> 00:05:53,310
Dude! Dude, that's Jay Cutler over there!
Quarterback for the Denver Broncos!

73
00:05:53,345 --> 00:05:56,151
Oh my God!
- Would you boys like to meet him?

74
00:05:56,196 --> 00:05:57,963
Are you serious?

75
00:05:58,015 --> 00:06:02,621
Jay, I want you to meet Stan and Kyle. They
broke a hundred thousand points on Guitar Hero.

76
00:06:02,658 --> 00:06:05,823
Wow, really? Nice to meet you guys.
- Nice to meet you!

77
00:06:05,858 --> 00:06:09,132
I mean, you kind of suck, but my dad
says you might be good someday.

78
00:06:09,177 --> 00:06:10,053
Thanks.

79
00:06:10,106 --> 00:06:11,833
Alex, have you seen my wife anywhere?

80
00:06:11,867 --> 00:06:15,941
You boys know Tom Shane from the Shane
Company Diamond Store commercials?

81
00:06:15,975 --> 00:06:17,850
Do we? He's a legend!

82
00:06:17,885 --> 00:06:19,422
You remember these boys, Tom.

83
00:06:19,455 --> 00:06:23,081
They're gonna break a million points live
at the video arcade in a few weeks.

84
00:06:23,115 --> 00:06:25,262
That, would be impressive.

85
00:06:25,707 --> 00:06:29,670
Dude, we've arrived. We're super,
awesome and cool.

86
00:06:29,705 --> 00:06:33,611
Yeah. Life is finally going to not suck
so hard for us.

87
00:06:44,865 --> 00:06:46,152
You Rock!

88
00:06:46,186 --> 00:06:48,532
All right, nice rehearsal, boys.

89
00:06:48,567 --> 00:06:51,291
Dude, I totally miffed that middle part.
Did you see that?

90
00:06:51,317 --> 00:06:54,501
Yeah dude, that's almost impossible.
- That was real cool, kids.

91
00:06:54,535 --> 00:06:59,061
Hey, Kyle, there's a different controller
in my car that might work better for you.

92
00:06:59,105 --> 00:07:01,351
Why don't you go with Jim
and he'll help you find it.

93
00:07:01,386 --> 00:07:03,060
Oh, okay. Cool.

94
00:07:05,047 --> 00:07:09,050
You've got real potential, kid.
I have no doubt you can break a million.

95
00:07:09,095 --> 00:07:11,713
Really? That'd be sweet.
- I think you could.

96
00:07:11,757 --> 00:07:16,280
But as for your friend, well, to be
honest, I think he's holding you back.

97
00:07:16,318 --> 00:07:17,472
What, you mean, Kyle?

98
00:07:17,488 --> 00:07:21,561
Look, you score a lot higher than him.
There's no question who the better one is.

99
00:07:21,596 --> 00:07:23,341
I wanna put you with some other players,

100
00:07:23,347 --> 00:07:26,740
find a partner for you who can
really help you max your score.

101
00:07:26,975 --> 00:07:31,420
But, Kyle and I always play together.
We both chipped in for the game system.

102
00:07:31,476 --> 00:07:35,870
Very honorable. But you know where loyalty
gets you in a game like Guitar Hero?

103
00:07:35,907 --> 00:07:39,540
Nowheres. Just listen to that video crowd.

104
00:07:40,468 --> 00:07:43,840
I haven't heard a video crowd
go that wild in a long time.

105
00:07:43,878 --> 00:07:46,760
You've got a chance to score a million points,

106
00:07:46,767 --> 00:07:50,901
and I hate to see you throw it away because
you're worried about your friend's feelings.

107
00:07:53,656 --> 00:07:58,651
You're gonna love this kid, Stan. He's one
of the best Guitar Hero players I've ever seen.

108
00:07:58,666 --> 00:08:00,312
Except for you, of course.

109
00:08:00,346 --> 00:08:01,702
Ah, Thad!

110
00:08:03,155 --> 00:08:07,293
Stan Marsh, this is Thad Jarvis.
- Sup?

111
00:08:07,667 --> 00:08:12,570
Thad here has backed up a lot of really great
Guitar Hero players. Isn't that right, Thad?

112
00:08:12,705 --> 00:08:13,622
Yup.

113
00:08:13,657 --> 00:08:18,191
He doesn't even need a game system to play
on. He can play Guitar Hero acoustically.

114
00:08:18,227 --> 00:08:20,843
Yeah, but can he play Buckethead
on Expert Level?

115
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:23,841
Go ahead, Thad. Show him what you can do.

116
00:08:25,707 --> 00:08:27,211
Check this out.

117
00:08:38,037 --> 00:08:39,932
Pretty damn good, huh?

118
00:08:39,977 --> 00:08:43,571
Yeah, that's pretty good.
But can you play "John the Fisherman"?

119
00:08:51,096 --> 00:08:55,670
Stan, with this kid backing you,
you're gonna make Guitar Hero history.

120
00:08:57,578 --> 00:08:59,791
Oh, I love this song.

121
00:09:18,508 --> 00:09:20,853
Wow wee, look at him go!

122
00:09:22,828 --> 00:09:24,943
Hey dude, how'd it-?

123
00:09:27,167 --> 00:09:28,363
Kyle.

124
00:09:30,278 --> 00:09:33,021
I thought you were sick.

125
00:09:36,117 --> 00:09:37,322
Who is this?

126
00:09:37,355 --> 00:09:41,283
This is Thad Jarvis.
- Sup?

127
00:09:42,446 --> 00:09:46,421
What's going on, Stan?
- Kyle, I was gonna tell you later.

128
00:09:46,458 --> 00:09:48,590
Mr. Kincaid thinks I should play with
Thad for a while.

129
00:09:48,637 --> 00:09:50,991
But it's our game. We bought it together.

130
00:09:51,027 --> 00:09:54,960
I know, and, and I wanna be fair about
it, so, I'll buy you out of your part.

131
00:09:54,997 --> 00:09:57,363
Buy me out?! What are you saying?!

132
00:09:57,398 --> 00:09:59,783
What makes you so high and mighty
you can buy me out?!

133
00:09:59,808 --> 00:10:03,493
Don't put this all on me, Kyle!
- Oh my God this is so awesome.

134
00:10:04,235 --> 00:10:06,473
You were the one that's been blowing off
playing after midnight,

135
00:10:06,478 --> 00:10:08,663
not playing because you were sick.
- I have been sick!

136
00:10:08,695 --> 00:10:11,343
Look, the point is I'm never gonna break
a million points playing with you!

137
00:10:11,376 --> 00:10:12,941
You know that's true!

138
00:10:14,588 --> 00:10:17,393
I guess I didn't realize it was just
about the points.

139
00:10:25,128 --> 00:10:27,153
Dude, this game rules.

140
00:10:27,345 --> 00:10:29,153
Let's just do this, all right?

141
00:10:39,357 --> 00:10:43,681
Hey! You're the kid I sold the Guitar Hero
game to. How are you liking it?

142
00:10:43,725 --> 00:10:46,792
It's okay, I guess.
But I need some game guides for it.

143
00:10:46,826 --> 00:10:49,430
My manager and producer set up
this live thing at the video arcade

144
00:10:49,434 --> 00:10:53,098
where I'm supposed to break a million in
front of everybody and I'm I'm stressing out.

145
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:55,600
Yeah, Guitar Hero can be pretty stressful.

146
00:10:55,638 --> 00:10:58,796
But you know, maybe instead of a game guide,

147
00:10:58,829 --> 00:11:03,522
you should just buy another game
to kind of ease the stress.

148
00:11:05,137 --> 00:11:09,761
Have you ever heard of Heroin Hero?
- Heroin Hero?

149
00:11:09,806 --> 00:11:11,152
It's a way easier game.

150
00:11:11,165 --> 00:11:14,303
All you do is run around a magical forest
and shoot simulated heroin.

151
00:11:14,408 --> 00:11:17,753
You could call it
the ultimate first-person shooter.

152
00:11:18,527 --> 00:11:20,250
And there's no score? No crowds?

153
00:11:20,286 --> 00:11:24,572
No man. All you do is run through
the pretty forest and chase a big dragon.

154
00:11:24,606 --> 00:11:29,312
But you don't ever catch the dragon.
You just keep chasing it.

155
00:11:32,838 --> 00:11:37,750
Chase me. Come on. This way.
Shoot up and then you can catch me.

156
00:11:37,795 --> 00:11:39,152
Come on.

157
00:11:39,456 --> 00:11:41,341
Dude, this is awesome.

158
00:11:48,086 --> 00:11:49,403
How are they coming?

159
00:11:49,437 --> 00:11:52,732
No worries, Mr. Hart. They'll be ready
for the big show in a few days.

160
00:11:52,776 --> 00:11:56,593
They'd better be. I paid good money
to rent this place out.

161
00:12:00,378 --> 00:12:01,452
Damnit!

162
00:12:01,477 --> 00:12:05,183
Dude, suck. Did you practice last night?
- Yeah, I practiced last night!

163
00:12:05,215 --> 00:12:06,693
Just shut up and play!

164
00:12:09,625 --> 00:12:11,760
No, you know what?! Screw this!

165
00:12:11,798 --> 00:12:14,472
I'm not playing this song! Why did
you pick this stupid song?!

166
00:12:14,506 --> 00:12:16,852
Stan, it's the song we all agreed you
would play.

167
00:12:16,896 --> 00:12:19,881
Yeah? Well I changed my mind!
We're changing the song to Cheap Trick!

168
00:12:19,915 --> 00:12:21,820
No way. I hate that bubblegum crap.

169
00:12:21,856 --> 00:12:26,152
Yeah? Well you're not the leader, are you,
Thad?! We play the music I wanna play!

170
00:12:26,187 --> 00:12:28,623
Stan, why are you so grumpy-grouchy?

171
00:12:28,657 --> 00:12:31,311
We're playing what I want
and I'll select a different song!

172
00:12:31,345 --> 00:12:33,640
Yeah? Well how about this one?

173
00:12:33,776 --> 00:12:34,903
I quite.

174
00:12:34,946 --> 00:12:36,562
I quit I quit I quit. I quit.

175
00:12:36,606 --> 00:12:39,310
I quit I quit I quit. I quit.

176
00:12:39,348 --> 00:12:40,882
You know what?
That's great with me, Thad.

177
00:12:40,885 --> 00:12:42,640
Because I don't need you to break
a million points!

178
00:12:42,648 --> 00:12:43,932
I never did!

179
00:12:43,967 --> 00:12:47,552
Stan, what is the matter with you?
- I just wanna play alone, alright?!

180
00:12:47,585 --> 00:12:50,503
I can't concentrate with all these
assholes riding me all the time!

181
00:12:50,538 --> 00:12:52,132
What is this?

182
00:12:53,078 --> 00:12:54,153
Man...

183
00:12:54,258 --> 00:12:57,612
Are you playing Heroin Hero?
- Just, just a little.

184
00:12:57,646 --> 00:13:03,143
No! Nobody plays Heroin Hero just a little!
You know, you never catch the dragon!

185
00:13:03,186 --> 00:13:05,262
I know, but it mellos me out, okay?!

186
00:13:05,295 --> 00:13:07,183
You'd better pull your act together,

187
00:13:07,188 --> 00:13:12,493
because now you're gonna have to break a
million points and unlock superstardom solo!

188
00:13:12,538 --> 00:13:13,813
No problem.

189
00:13:33,175 --> 00:13:36,222
Hey, beat it, kid! We wanna play now!
- I'm not done yet.

190
00:13:36,256 --> 00:13:38,852
Hey, I know you. You're Kyle Broflovski.

191
00:13:38,886 --> 00:13:41,232
Didn't you used to have your own
Guitar Hero game system?

192
00:13:41,258 --> 00:13:43,681
No. You're thinking of somebody else.
- Yeah, sure.

193
00:13:43,686 --> 00:13:45,592
He's the kid that scored
a hundred thousand points.

194
00:13:45,625 --> 00:13:49,421
How come you're playing here now?
- Look, just go ahead and play, alright?

195
00:13:49,457 --> 00:13:50,910
Leave me alone.

196
00:13:53,267 --> 00:13:55,402
Can I get a Fresca, please?

197
00:13:58,615 --> 00:14:04,001
You're good at that game, Kid.
Too good to be playing in a dump like this.

198
00:14:04,198 --> 00:14:09,492
Yeah well, I can't really afford to play
anymore anyway. I'm about out of quarters.

199
00:14:10,436 --> 00:14:15,771
Well look, maybe I can use some extra music
playing to this thing on weekend nights.

200
00:14:15,815 --> 00:14:20,860
You come in, work around here a little
and maybe you can play it for free.

201
00:14:20,907 --> 00:14:24,440
I appreciate what you're trying to do, Mick,
but I ain't a charity case yet.

202
00:14:24,478 --> 00:14:30,692
Charity case, I'm just trying to help out
a kid who's a little down on his luck is all.

203
00:14:31,446 --> 00:14:32,822
Thanks, Mick.

204
00:14:34,807 --> 00:14:37,093
Catch me. Come on, catch me.

205
00:14:38,986 --> 00:14:42,010
What's wrong? Follow me. Come on.

206
00:14:42,748 --> 00:14:44,792
Marsh? Stan, you got-

207
00:14:44,798 --> 00:14:46,272
Oh my God!

208
00:14:46,885 --> 00:14:48,380
Get up, Stan! Wake up!

209
00:14:48,426 --> 00:14:49,451
Huh? What?

210
00:14:49,485 --> 00:14:52,300
You're going on in ten minutes!
Everybody's coming to see you!

211
00:14:52,347 --> 00:14:54,692
The dragon. Where did it go?

212
00:14:54,857 --> 00:14:56,990
You've gotta pull it together!

213
00:14:58,647 --> 00:15:00,961
Pull it together, goddamnit!

214
00:15:03,755 --> 00:15:08,642
Thank you for coming to Gamecraft Arcade
to watch Stan Marsh break a million points

215
00:15:08,657 --> 00:15:10,811
and unluck superstardom.

216
00:15:13,925 --> 00:15:17,323
Go Stan!
- All right, Stan, you've got it, man!

217
00:15:17,675 --> 00:15:18,953
Dude, what's the matter with him?

218
00:15:18,978 --> 00:15:22,073
He's been up for three days straight
playing Heroin Hero.

219
00:15:22,277 --> 00:15:24,432
Come on, Stan! You got it!

220
00:15:25,637 --> 00:15:27,820
Goddamnit, he's a mess!

221
00:15:38,837 --> 00:15:41,240
Oh man, I can't watch this.

222
00:15:44,325 --> 00:15:48,213
What are you doing?!
The video crowd is starting to boo!

223
00:15:50,265 --> 00:15:52,773
Come on guys. Let's get out of here.

224
00:15:57,207 --> 00:16:02,191
The next time you bring me some talent,
make sure they're talent-ed.

225
00:16:05,808 --> 00:16:12,151
You blew it! You had it all and you blew it!
Listen to that video crowd! They hate you!

226
00:16:26,466 --> 00:16:28,181
There he is!

227
00:16:28,727 --> 00:16:30,760
So, did you break a million yet?

228
00:16:30,805 --> 00:16:33,671
No, I didn't break a million points
and unlock superstardom, all right?

229
00:16:33,716 --> 00:16:35,310
I'm done with that stupid game!

230
00:16:35,347 --> 00:16:40,283
Aw, come on. Once you start playing Guitar
Hero, you can't stop till you reach the top.

231
00:16:40,315 --> 00:16:42,553
I just wanna find something else to play.

232
00:16:42,638 --> 00:16:45,400
Have you played Rehab Hero?

233
00:16:45,435 --> 00:16:48,653
You get chased by a big dragon,
but you keep running away from it.

234
00:16:48,655 --> 00:16:51,562
I just want a nice, simple driving game.
How about that?

235
00:16:51,598 --> 00:16:54,092
Sure kid. Sure.

236
00:16:58,736 --> 00:17:03,050
All right, that was the Splendifs.
And now here's a hit you all remember.

237
00:17:03,085 --> 00:17:08,652
It's the song that two local fourth grade boys
scored a 100.000 points to on Guitar Hero.

238
00:17:09,378 --> 00:17:14,663
Don't know whatever happened to those boys.
I guess they're not playing the game anymore.

239
00:17:50,475 --> 00:17:55,503
<i>Woke up to the sound of pouring rain</i>

240
00:17:55,878 --> 00:18:00,870
<i>The wind would whisper and I'd think of you</i>

241
00:18:01,316 --> 00:18:06,292
<i>And all the tears you cried,
that called my name</i>

242
00:18:08,015 --> 00:18:11,151
Kyle, could I just talk to you
for like five minutes?

243
00:18:11,846 --> 00:18:15,040
What are you doing here?
- Please, it won't take long.

244
00:18:15,076 --> 00:18:19,332
Goddamnit. We're gonna take
a short break. Be back in five.

245
00:18:22,805 --> 00:18:25,931
I was listening to you for a while.
Dude, you've gotten a lot better.

246
00:18:25,966 --> 00:18:30,301
Oh, thank you! I was so eagerly awaiting
your approval of my abilities!

247
00:18:30,348 --> 00:18:32,502
Look, Kyle, the game is still set up
at my house and...

248
00:18:32,508 --> 00:18:34,412
maybe we could go try playing
it again over there.

249
00:18:34,447 --> 00:18:37,581
Oh, so the gallant knight now comes to
rescue me from the bowels of mediocrity!

250
00:18:37,615 --> 00:18:40,041
Oh, thank you, your royal lordship!

251
00:18:40,207 --> 00:18:41,351
That isn't it at all.

252
00:18:41,366 --> 00:18:43,850
You don't get it, Stan!
I can play here all I want.

253
00:18:43,865 --> 00:18:47,741
I even get free Frescas.
I don't need you anymore!

254
00:18:48,346 --> 00:18:51,232
I know. I need you.

255
00:18:52,845 --> 00:18:56,273
I thought I was having a great time because
I was getting signed by managers and...

256
00:18:56,288 --> 00:18:59,680
going to big sex and coke parties,
but then I realized...

257
00:18:59,716 --> 00:19:04,823
I was having fun because I was doing
all that with my best friend.

258
00:19:07,506 --> 00:19:09,762
It was pretty fun, wasn't it?

259
00:19:10,768 --> 00:19:11,990
Yeah.

260
00:19:12,567 --> 00:19:15,123
Look, I doubt we could break
a million together anyway.

261
00:19:15,175 --> 00:19:18,603
I don't care.
I'd just like to play with you again.

262
00:19:18,867 --> 00:19:20,122
For the fun of it.

263
00:19:20,158 --> 00:19:25,641
I don't really see the fun in not trying
to kick that game's ass once and for all!

264
00:19:26,005 --> 00:19:28,143
What, you mean it?
- I think we can do it, Stan.

265
00:19:28,147 --> 00:19:30,473
I've been close to a million
a few times by myself.

266
00:19:30,486 --> 00:19:31,581
Then let's go, dude!

267
00:19:31,618 --> 00:19:34,052
Oh wait. Wait, I'm supposed to play here.

268
00:19:36,017 --> 00:19:38,552
Hey, Mick, would you mind if
I stepped out for a sec?

269
00:19:38,558 --> 00:19:43,810
Go on, get out of here, kid. Who needs your
wailing and rocking around here anyways?

270
00:19:43,845 --> 00:19:45,243
Thanks, Mick!

271
00:19:49,467 --> 00:19:51,443
All right, dude, let's do this.

272
00:19:51,728 --> 00:19:53,131
What the hell?

273
00:19:56,418 --> 00:19:59,531
Come on, come on. You almost got me.

274
00:19:59,567 --> 00:20:01,493
Catch me. Come on.

275
00:20:01,527 --> 00:20:06,342
Goddamnit! Dad, get off our X-Box!
- Hang on, I almost caught the dragon.

276
00:20:06,387 --> 00:20:08,301
Hehe, you almost caught me.

277
00:20:08,527 --> 00:20:10,361
No, me and Kyle are gonna play Guitar Hero!

278
00:20:10,396 --> 00:20:16,010
I can get him! Wait! Where's he going now?
- You don't ever catch the dragon, Dad!

279
00:20:16,768 --> 00:20:21,533
No! No, I said!
I am your father! Put it back on!

280
00:20:21,568 --> 00:20:23,670
Mom, will you get Dad out of here?

281
00:20:26,058 --> 00:20:28,582
Stop cheating, Craig!
- How was that cheating!

282
00:20:28,615 --> 00:20:30,383
Because you tricked me, you black asshole!

283
00:20:30,416 --> 00:20:32,762
Fellas! Fellas!

284
00:20:33,376 --> 00:20:35,450
They're gonna do it!
- What?

285
00:20:35,495 --> 00:20:40,952
Stan and Kyle! They're about to break a million
on Guitar Hero and unlock superstardom!

286
00:20:41,776 --> 00:20:43,660
Oh, let's go! Cone on, let's go!

287
00:20:55,068 --> 00:20:56,762
They're gonna do it!

288
00:21:00,187 --> 00:21:03,120
They did it!
- Oh my sweet J-Jesus!

289
00:21:03,185 --> 00:21:07,371
You have played Guitar Hero enough
to reach one million points!

290
00:21:07,777 --> 00:21:09,323
Congratulations!

291
00:21:09,367 --> 00:21:10,163
You.

292
00:21:10,198 --> 00:21:11,380
Are.

293
00:21:11,418 --> 00:21:12,840
Fags.

294
00:21:20,497 --> 00:21:21,863
That's it?

295
00:21:22,375 --> 00:21:23,803
Goddamnit!

296
00:21:23,915 --> 00:21:25,482
God damnit!

297
00:21:32,507 --> 00:21:34,251
Butters, you wanna play me next?

298
00:21:34,287 --> 00:21:38,681
Okay, but I get to be the one that
betrays you after the sex and drug party.
