"The List"</i>

3
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:11,269
<i>I'm going out to South Park
gonna have myself a time</i>

4
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:14,675
<i>Friendly faces everywhere
humble folks without temptation</i>

5
00:00:14,706 --> 00:00:18,022
<i>I'm goin out to south park
gonna leave my woes behind</i>

6
00:00:18,053 --> 00:00:21,282
<i>Ample parking day or night
people spouting howdy neighbor</i>

7
00:00:21,314 --> 00:00:24,523
<i>I'm heading out to south park
to see if i cant unwind</i>

8
00:00:24,554 --> 00:00:27,875
<i>I like girls with big fat titties
really big fat titties</i>

9
00:00:27,906 --> 00:00:31,381
<i>So come on out to south park
and meet some friends of mine</i>

10
00:00:34,797 --> 00:00:39,360
Fellas! Fellas! Oh my god!
You're not gonna believe this!

11
00:00:39,374 --> 00:00:40,638
Dude, Butters, calm down.

12
00:00:40,660 --> 00:00:42,420
Okay. Okay.

13
00:00:42,508 --> 00:00:45,696
I was talking to Pete Wetchney
and he said that Danny Chadwick

14
00:00:45,699 --> 00:00:50,040
said that his sister told him that
the girls in our class have a list

15
00:00:50,047 --> 00:00:53,801
that rates every boy's looks
from cutest to ugliest.

16
00:00:55,075 --> 00:00:57,563
So who do they say is the cutest?
- I dunno.

17
00:00:57,597 --> 00:01:01,470
Who do they say is the ugliest?
- I don't know. It's like a girl thing.

18
00:01:01,497 --> 00:01:04,173
They won't let anybody see the list but them.

19
00:01:09,066 --> 00:01:11,481
They can't do that. Who are they
to judge us on how we look?

20
00:01:11,505 --> 00:01:14,992
Yeah. You think they rate us just for looks
or they take personality into account?

21
00:01:15,018 --> 00:01:17,022
If it's just looks then I think I'm safe.

22
00:01:17,045 --> 00:01:21,060
You guys, who cares if the girls make some
stupid list? Girls make dumb lists all the time.

23
00:01:21,095 --> 00:01:23,631
Yeah, Kyle's right. Screw it, we have
better things to worry about.

24
00:01:23,647 --> 00:01:26,581
You're just saying that because you know
you're gonna be very last on the list!

25
00:01:26,628 --> 00:01:30,283
Oh please, I don't think so, Craig!
Chicks think I'm way hotter than you!

26
00:01:30,306 --> 00:01:32,491
You don't think they put the fat tub
of tard at the bottom?

27
00:01:32,526 --> 00:01:34,821
No, because people know I'm not fat!
I'm buff.

28
00:01:34,845 --> 00:01:37,731
They probably put you at the bottom of
the list because you have fucked up teeth!

29
00:01:37,765 --> 00:01:41,361
Or Kenny's because he's poor.
- They didn't put me at the bottom, did they?

30
00:01:41,397 --> 00:01:44,851
Kenny, face it: Girls don't wanna eat Pop Tarts
for dinner every night when they get married.

31
00:01:44,896 --> 00:01:47,482
You don't think they said I'm
the ugliest boy in the class, do ya?

32
00:01:47,505 --> 00:01:49,431
Well if they did, my parents will ground me.

33
00:01:49,455 --> 00:01:53,962
You guys, do you really care what a bunch of
girls have to say about how you rank in looks?!

34
00:01:58,675 --> 00:02:00,753
All right, Bebe, let's see the list.
- What?

35
00:02:00,787 --> 00:02:02,293
You know what I'm talking about, bitch!

36
00:02:02,308 --> 00:02:04,542
The list where you rate the looks
of each boy in the class!

37
00:02:04,586 --> 00:02:08,202
That's not for boys to look at!
It's a secret girl list and you can't see it!

38
00:02:08,225 --> 00:02:09,473
Craig is on the bottom, right?

39
00:02:09,477 --> 00:02:11,762
Or is it Kenny because you'd be eating
Pop Tarts for dinner if you married him.

40
00:02:11,776 --> 00:02:16,002
I'm not telling! And anyway,
I'm not the list keeper, Nelly is!

41
00:02:16,025 --> 00:02:19,880
And Nelly will never let you look at it,
so there!

42
00:02:23,745 --> 00:02:26,492
Fuck you Bebe! Fuck you bitch!

43
00:02:26,736 --> 00:02:29,540
Well, I guess we're never gonna
get that list from the girls.

44
00:02:29,576 --> 00:02:33,682
Screw that, dude! We're guys.
We can outthink them.

45
00:02:36,617 --> 00:02:37,972
All right, here's what we know.

46
00:02:37,975 --> 00:02:40,413
That chick Nelly is the one who's
in charge of holding the list, right.

47
00:02:40,457 --> 00:02:44,353
She apparently keeps it in a purple Pee Chee
folder and we need a plan to get it from her.

48
00:02:44,376 --> 00:02:47,553
This is what I call:
"Operation: Cannot Possibly Fail"

49
00:02:47,585 --> 00:02:48,613
Neato!

50
00:02:48,615 --> 00:02:51,601
At 1 p.m. tomorrow, Nelly will have
to walk from Home Ec to Social Studies.

51
00:02:51,645 --> 00:02:53,080
That's our best time to strike.

52
00:02:53,117 --> 00:02:54,662
As she makes her way through Hallway 3,

53
00:02:54,666 --> 00:02:56,991
Craig will be ready with
a distraction device here.

54
00:02:57,025 --> 00:02:58,870
When she stops and turns to Craig
in the hallway,

55
00:02:58,887 --> 00:03:02,261
Butters will run up and kick her in the balls.

56
00:03:02,297 --> 00:03:03,330
Okay!

57
00:03:03,368 --> 00:03:06,203
Once Butters kicks her in the balls, she'll
fall to the floor, dropping the Pee Chee,

58
00:03:06,216 --> 00:03:10,020
and Kenny will swoop in from Corridor 3-Delta
and grab the Pee Chee. Are we good?

59
00:03:20,455 --> 00:03:22,182
What you do that for?!

60
00:03:24,058 --> 00:03:26,341
Hey, what's your problem, asshole?!

61
00:03:26,815 --> 00:03:28,432
Bail, bail!

62
00:03:30,208 --> 00:03:32,603
Okay, our mission failed,
but we've learned a lot.

63
00:03:32,635 --> 00:03:37,060
Primarily that girls do not have balls.
- They sure don't.

64
00:03:37,097 --> 00:03:39,211
Never mind, because we are going to Plan B,

65
00:03:39,247 --> 00:03:42,491
one that I call "Operation:
Cannot Possibly Fail A Second Time."

66
00:03:42,527 --> 00:03:44,033
When Nelly leaves the cafeteria for recess,

67
00:03:44,037 --> 00:03:45,683
Kenny will jump in front of her
and spit on the ground.

68
00:03:45,685 --> 00:03:48,691
You think maybe girls keep their balls
on the inside of their tummies?

69
00:03:48,726 --> 00:03:51,640
Butters, we're done talking about
girls balls right now! Pay attention!

70
00:03:56,835 --> 00:04:02,020
We got it! We got it!
- We got the list from the girls!

71
00:04:03,426 --> 00:04:06,031
Give that back you dirty buttholes!

72
00:04:06,547 --> 00:04:09,383
Tape it to the wall, Kenny!
Jason, watch the door!

73
00:04:13,105 --> 00:04:17,100
It's listed in order from cutest to ugliest.
Clyde's number one.

74
00:04:17,138 --> 00:04:19,291
Me? I'm the cutest?

75
00:04:19,328 --> 00:04:23,003
And then Token and then me.
- I'm number two? Wow.

76
00:04:23,046 --> 00:04:25,453
Come on, let me see!

77
00:04:31,047 --> 00:04:36,043
Oh boy! I'm number 11!
Whoopie! Number 11!

78
00:04:36,597 --> 00:04:41,952
Ah! Look at that! I'm hotter than you, fatso!
- What?! That's bullcrap!

79
00:04:45,575 --> 00:04:47,803
Oh, so big deal, guys!
Do you feel better now?

80
00:04:47,847 --> 00:04:50,861
Clyde's the best looking kid in the class.
And then Token and Stan.

81
00:04:50,895 --> 00:04:53,432
And last is Francis, Cartman, and...

82
00:04:59,818 --> 00:05:00,943
Me?

83
00:05:01,847 --> 00:05:03,482
You're last, dude!

84
00:05:05,196 --> 00:05:08,201
No way.
- Yes way! Check it out!

85
00:05:09,585 --> 00:05:13,231
Cartman, lay off! You're next to last.
- So? I'm hotter than Kyle.

86
00:05:13,265 --> 00:05:18,471
I'm better looking than Kyle!
Yes! I'm hotter than Kyle!

87
00:05:18,568 --> 00:05:20,751
I'm last? Last?

88
00:05:20,786 --> 00:05:27,111
Dude, it's just a stupid list, remember?
- I got voted the ugliest boy in whole class?

89
00:05:27,305 --> 00:05:29,722
Who cares what dumb girls think, right?

90
00:05:48,517 --> 00:05:53,533
Mom, Dad! I'm not the ugliest kid
in the class! Kyle Broflovski is!

91
00:05:53,675 --> 00:05:56,691
Well good for you, Butters.
- Way to go, champ.

92
00:05:56,728 --> 00:05:57,961
Whoopie!

93
00:05:58,598 --> 00:06:01,123
Well, guess we don't have to ground him.

94
00:06:04,668 --> 00:06:07,971
Kyle, what's the matter?
You barely touched your knishes.

95
00:06:08,875 --> 00:06:13,602
The girls at school. They made
a list and voted me the ugliest boy.

96
00:06:13,787 --> 00:06:17,922
What? That's ridiculous.
My little bubbeleh is adorable!

97
00:06:17,956 --> 00:06:22,292
Look, I know I'm not the best-looking guy in
town, but I didn't think I was the very ugliest.

98
00:06:22,327 --> 00:06:27,583
You're not ugly, Kyle. You're my perfect
little man. You look just like your father.

99
00:06:28,865 --> 00:06:30,661
Oh God! I do?

100
00:06:30,727 --> 00:06:33,052
But he has his mother's nose.

101
00:06:34,276 --> 00:06:37,433
Kyle, you are very handsome
and perfect in every way.

102
00:06:37,468 --> 00:06:41,383
Ike, you have to be honest.
Am I ugly, yes or no?

103
00:06:47,015 --> 00:06:50,850
You all think I'm ugly. Jesus Christ,
the least you could have done is told me!

104
00:06:50,886 --> 00:06:52,740
Kyle, come back here!

105
00:07:00,545 --> 00:07:03,051
I'm better-looking than you!

106
00:07:04,477 --> 00:07:07,283
The girls think I'm better-looking
than you, Kyle!

107
00:07:08,455 --> 00:07:11,012
Dude, Kyle. Can you hear me?

108
00:07:11,146 --> 00:07:13,622
They totally think I'm hotter than you are.

109
00:07:13,876 --> 00:07:14,900
Kyle!

110
00:07:15,735 --> 00:07:17,553
Kyle, I'm more attractive.

111
00:07:17,588 --> 00:07:18,560
Kyle?

112
00:07:21,115 --> 00:07:23,311
Clyde, it's time to be getting to bed.

113
00:07:26,305 --> 00:07:28,263
Hey, what's going on?

114
00:07:29,916 --> 00:07:31,800
What's going on? Hey.

115
00:07:33,156 --> 00:07:36,423
Oh yeah, hey, whassup?
What's going on?

116
00:07:37,727 --> 00:07:38,903
Nice.

117
00:07:47,486 --> 00:07:49,660
Hey, what's going on?
- Hey Clyde.

118
00:07:49,678 --> 00:07:51,212
Hey.
- Hi Clyde.

119
00:07:51,245 --> 00:07:52,643
What's going on?

120
00:07:55,787 --> 00:07:56,962
Hey ugly!

121
00:08:02,857 --> 00:08:07,403
Hey, Kyle. Look man, it doesn't
matter what people think, okay?

122
00:08:07,677 --> 00:08:12,400
You know, Abraham Lincoln was pretty
ugly too, but look what he accomplished.

123
00:08:13,205 --> 00:08:14,691
Chin up, cowboy.

124
00:08:14,877 --> 00:08:18,082
Hey, what's going on?
- Oh, not much, just hanging around-

125
00:08:18,115 --> 00:08:22,210
Hey, nice nice ears. Pizza Face!

126
00:08:23,616 --> 00:08:27,190
Butters, that's not cool, man.
He can't help how he looks.

127
00:08:31,325 --> 00:08:35,102
Kyle, I was going to suggest
that maybe you should...

128
00:08:35,136 --> 00:08:37,692
hang out with the other ugly kids
in the school.

129
00:08:37,728 --> 00:08:41,612
Because if you hang out with them,
you won't stand out so much. Right?

130
00:08:41,997 --> 00:08:43,233
Cool.

131
00:09:00,846 --> 00:09:01,862
Hey.

132
00:09:03,515 --> 00:09:04,571
Hello.

133
00:09:09,228 --> 00:09:11,223
Are you going to eat your pickle?

134
00:09:39,855 --> 00:09:43,880
Could somebody toss the football back?
It's over there next to the ugly kids.

135
00:09:46,868 --> 00:09:50,662
I hate coming to this school.
It makes me angry.

136
00:09:50,906 --> 00:09:51,942
Yeah.

137
00:09:52,355 --> 00:09:58,130
Sometimes I just want to burn it down.
Burn the whole school down to the ground!

138
00:09:58,817 --> 00:10:02,900
No. You know what?
Screw this! We aren't ugly!

139
00:10:02,936 --> 00:10:04,711
We're not?
- No!

140
00:10:04,748 --> 00:10:09,112
Maybe we all just need a little image
change, you know? Like a makeover.

141
00:10:09,148 --> 00:10:10,472
Hey yeah.

142
00:10:10,506 --> 00:10:13,383
Like you! Maybe you just need
to let your hair down.

143
00:10:13,425 --> 00:10:15,980
And let's see how you look without
those glasses.

144
00:10:23,504 --> 00:10:25,708
Let's just put those back on.

145
00:10:36,490 --> 00:10:39,120
I know, that song is so awesome.

146
00:10:39,718 --> 00:10:44,326
Wendy. Could I talk to you?
- Of course, Stan.

147
00:10:44,359 --> 00:10:46,533
Just for a minute. Over here.

148
00:10:47,808 --> 00:10:50,622
You think he's gonna beg her
to come back to him?

149
00:10:51,305 --> 00:10:54,572
This is a nice surprise. I thought
you were never speaking to me again.

150
00:10:54,605 --> 00:10:57,291
Yeah well, I wanna talk to you
about this list you girls made.

151
00:10:57,406 --> 00:10:59,000
Which one? We make lists all the time.

152
00:10:59,028 --> 00:11:00,962
The one where you rated the boys
looks in the class.

153
00:11:00,997 --> 00:11:04,371
Look, it really messed Kyle up, okay?
How could you vote him the ugliest?

154
00:11:04,417 --> 00:11:06,512
Look, personally, I didn't vote him
the ugliest.

155
00:11:06,517 --> 00:11:09,430
My vote was for Eric Cartman. But enough
of the other girls must have felt he was-

156
00:11:09,435 --> 00:11:11,913
So it was unanimous.
Maybe you can just change the list.

157
00:11:11,947 --> 00:11:15,160
Change the list?! Do you have
any idea what that would take?!

158
00:11:15,196 --> 00:11:18,002
Maybe you don't understand how
important list-making is to girls!

159
00:11:18,025 --> 00:11:20,921
It's just not something we
do flippantly! There's protocol!

160
00:11:20,956 --> 00:11:25,630
Can't we just talk to all the girls who made
the list and find out why they voted Kyle last?

161
00:11:26,678 --> 00:11:31,670
All right, I'll try and get you into our next
list-making meeting. But it won't be easy.

162
00:11:36,546 --> 00:11:40,951
Today's list meeting is called to order.
Rebecca, you have the floor.

163
00:11:40,987 --> 00:11:45,442
If it pleases and sparkles I suggest
we continue deliberations on List 47D:

164
00:11:45,475 --> 00:11:47,411
Which Girl Has The Cutest Purse?

165
00:11:47,436 --> 00:11:51,661
Rebecca moves we work on List 47D.
Does that sparkle with all the girls?

166
00:11:51,696 --> 00:11:52,990
Sunshine.

167
00:11:53,098 --> 00:11:56,771
Deliberating "Which Girl Has The Cutest
Purse"? Milly has the floor.

168
00:11:57,197 --> 00:11:58,521
If it pleases and sparkles,

169
00:11:58,528 --> 00:12:01,162
I would like to submit that Jennifer's
purse is by far the cutest.

170
00:12:01,167 --> 00:12:03,093
Definitely cuter than Teresa's.

171
00:12:03,127 --> 00:12:06,732
I don't think anyone here disagrees that
Jennifer's purse is cuter than Teresa's,

172
00:12:06,737 --> 00:12:08,220
but it doesn't make it the cutest.

173
00:12:08,247 --> 00:12:13,641
The committee has already decided that nothing
with stripes can be in the Top 5 cutest purses.

174
00:12:13,688 --> 00:12:16,411
Sunshine sparkle Wendy has the floor.

175
00:12:16,758 --> 00:12:20,033
If it pleases and sparkles,
I would like to suggest that we...

176
00:12:20,806 --> 00:12:25,162
That we reopen last week's list for debate.
- What'd she say? She's gotta be kidding!

177
00:12:25,216 --> 00:12:27,021
Is she crazy?

178
00:12:27,058 --> 00:12:30,013
All right, come before the Rainbow Railing.

179
00:12:31,378 --> 00:12:32,622
Go ahead.

180
00:12:33,238 --> 00:12:37,072
I was just thinking that maybe you
voted a little hastily on the cutest boy?

181
00:12:37,108 --> 00:12:39,482
You thought you should be number one?
- No.

182
00:12:39,516 --> 00:12:43,162
Let me assure you that no list
is made hastily by this committee!

183
00:12:43,198 --> 00:12:47,680
He didn't mean that. He was just saying maybe
we should open it up again for discussion.

184
00:12:47,718 --> 00:12:50,992
I cannot by Sparkle Law move
to have an old list investigated.

185
00:12:51,018 --> 00:12:54,851
However, if you can find recourse for
such an inquiry, Wendy, I would review it.

186
00:12:54,887 --> 00:12:56,833
Does that sparkle with all the girls?

187
00:12:56,878 --> 00:12:58,152
Sunshine.

188
00:13:05,985 --> 00:13:07,802
They all laugh at me!

189
00:13:07,845 --> 00:13:12,502
And the girls giggle behind my back!
Unable to even glance at my disfigured face.

190
00:13:12,787 --> 00:13:16,012
<i>Do not burn down the school, Kyle.</i>

191
00:13:16,815 --> 00:13:19,283
Who said that?
- I did.

192
00:13:21,967 --> 00:13:26,101
Do you know who I am?
- Abraham Lincoln?

193
00:13:26,308 --> 00:13:32,853
I am Abraham Lincoln. Burning down the
school will not solve your problems.

194
00:13:32,888 --> 00:13:35,842
You think you've been cheated
because you are ugly,

195
00:13:35,845 --> 00:13:41,540
but I am here to show you otherwise.
Come! There is much to see.

196
00:13:42,888 --> 00:13:45,112
I want you to look in here.

197
00:13:45,278 --> 00:13:47,400
This woman is Nancy Pinkerton.

198
00:13:47,438 --> 00:13:52,570
As a child she was consistently the
most beautiful girl in her entire school.

199
00:13:52,606 --> 00:13:56,833
Her life as a youth was filled with praises
and everything being handed to her.

200
00:13:56,867 --> 00:14:01,031
Boys told her she was special.
She was funny. She was interesting.

201
00:14:01,076 --> 00:14:03,530
But that's only because she was hot.

202
00:14:03,565 --> 00:14:08,140
It wasn't until she reached age 40,
when her looks started to fade,

203
00:14:08,176 --> 00:14:13,593
that she learned she was actually about
as interesting and special, as a wet carrot.

204
00:14:15,705 --> 00:14:18,920
This is the home of your new ugly friend,
Yamal.

205
00:14:18,955 --> 00:14:21,932
Because he's ugly,
he gets nothing handed to him.

206
00:14:21,967 --> 00:14:24,803
He has to work at making something of himself.

207
00:14:24,835 --> 00:14:27,710
But that work is gonna pay off
when he's an adult.

208
00:14:27,746 --> 00:14:32,363
He will have character, something
that kids who are hot rarely develop.

209
00:14:32,398 --> 00:14:34,373
Like your classmate, Clyde.

210
00:14:34,408 --> 00:14:39,060
Now that he knows he's good-looking, he doesn't
have to make any effort to be special.

211
00:14:39,105 --> 00:14:42,832
No, Rebecca's just a friend.
I wanna be with you now.

212
00:14:43,136 --> 00:14:45,193
Sure, yeah, I'll buy you some shoes too.

213
00:14:45,226 --> 00:14:47,811
Now his life will be about girls.

214
00:14:47,846 --> 00:14:50,783
Chatting with them on the phone
and buying them shoes.

215
00:14:50,825 --> 00:14:53,003
He will most likely marry very young,

216
00:14:53,038 --> 00:14:57,271
and not realize until age 40
that he's a total douche.

217
00:14:57,318 --> 00:15:02,161
And so you see, Kyle, it is actually
the beautiful kids that are cursed.

218
00:15:02,195 --> 00:15:05,880
But I can't wait to be an adult to
be happy. That's forever from now.

219
00:15:05,916 --> 00:15:08,581
You must be patient.
- Just take me home!

220
00:15:08,616 --> 00:15:10,963
I don't wanna be here anymore!
Take me home!

221
00:15:11,758 --> 00:15:13,210
Very well.

222
00:15:19,278 --> 00:15:21,693
Kyle, you need to think about
what I've told you.

223
00:15:21,738 --> 00:15:25,531
I don't want to! I don't want anybody
telling me how to feel anymore!

224
00:15:25,567 --> 00:15:28,231
Well then you're just a fucking asshole!

225
00:15:34,427 --> 00:15:37,342
Wait a minute. Wait, Stan,
I think I've got something!

226
00:15:37,377 --> 00:15:41,232
Take a look at this: during final
deliberation of the list for cutest boy,

227
00:15:41,237 --> 00:15:45,000
seven girls gave Clyde a glitter rating
of only one sparkle.

228
00:15:45,038 --> 00:15:48,243
I have no idea what you're talking about.
- It doesn't add up.

229
00:15:48,277 --> 00:15:50,460
It is possible that Rebecca made a mistake

230
00:15:50,468 --> 00:15:53,643
when she tallied the sunshine votes
onto the final list.

231
00:15:56,477 --> 00:15:57,863
Oh, hey Wendy.

232
00:15:57,886 --> 00:16:01,763
Hey Rebecca. Do you still have the voter
cards for the list that rated the boys looks?

233
00:16:01,808 --> 00:16:04,112
Wendy, we're done with that list.

234
00:16:04,148 --> 00:16:06,301
I know, but I think there's been a mistake.

235
00:16:06,328 --> 00:16:09,281
Six of the girls I've talked to didn't
vote Clyde the cutest.

236
00:16:09,317 --> 00:16:11,043
That means that mathematically
he should have been-

237
00:16:11,045 --> 00:16:15,302
All right, you need to stop.
Digging. Around, Wendy!

238
00:16:15,727 --> 00:16:19,002
You might not like what you find!

239
00:16:19,048 --> 00:16:22,682
Just back off and stop asking questions!

240
00:16:22,715 --> 00:16:28,592
You're getting close to a secret that
I don't think you can handle! Let it go!

241
00:16:32,916 --> 00:16:34,932
That didn't sparkle with her, did it?

242
00:16:38,946 --> 00:16:43,520
One canister of propane,
six cans of lighter fluid,

243
00:16:43,558 --> 00:16:48,931
seven gallons of high-octane kerosene
and a box of matches.

244
00:16:49,155 --> 00:16:53,883
Okay, is that everything, little boy?
- That should just about do it.

245
00:16:53,918 --> 00:16:56,952
Do you like to put this on your
True-Value card today?

246
00:16:57,578 --> 00:16:59,420
Honorary Chair, Mrs. Secretary,

247
00:16:59,428 --> 00:17:02,820
I believe a member of our committee
has tampered with one of our lists.

248
00:17:02,857 --> 00:17:07,163
I've compiled a full report and it turns out
that nobody voted Clude the cutest in the class.

249
00:17:07,196 --> 00:17:11,570
I believe Rebecca changed the list
to make him number one.

250
00:17:11,608 --> 00:17:14,301
Why would she do that?
- Right after the list was made,

251
00:17:14,305 --> 00:17:17,931
Rebecca started going out with Clyde.
You can read all the discrepancies here.

252
00:17:17,946 --> 00:17:20,510
We need to remake that list.

253
00:17:24,495 --> 00:17:27,170
You just couldn't let it go!

254
00:17:27,747 --> 00:17:32,353
What do you mean? Call the girls in.
- I'm afraid we can't do that, Wendy!

255
00:17:32,697 --> 00:17:36,601
Did you know, Wendy, that Clyde's
father own the shoe store at the mall?

256
00:17:36,718 --> 00:17:39,622
A lot of us have always wanted
to date Clyde to get free shoes,

257
00:17:39,628 --> 00:17:42,852
but we couldn't, because
he wasn't popular enough.

258
00:17:44,078 --> 00:17:45,542
You knew!

259
00:17:45,687 --> 00:17:49,172
Unfortunately, the members voted Clyde
in the bottom five of the list!

260
00:17:49,208 --> 00:17:54,882
That's why we had to manipulate the votes,
forge a new list and hide the real one!

261
00:17:54,965 --> 00:17:58,941
So that you all could justify dating
Clyde and get shoes?!

262
00:17:58,976 --> 00:18:01,441
How dare you take advantage of your position!

263
00:18:01,478 --> 00:18:04,963
I'm gonna tell Bebe and have you both
disbarred from the list committee!

264
00:18:05,368 --> 00:18:08,643
Bebe?! Who do you think authorized
the buyout?!

265
00:18:10,505 --> 00:18:12,801
No. Not Bebe.

266
00:18:12,838 --> 00:18:16,420
She's dating Clyde now.
Nobody loves shoes more than her.

267
00:18:17,346 --> 00:18:18,361
What's going on?

268
00:18:18,367 --> 00:18:20,840
When the other girls find out you
ignored their votes, they're gonna-

269
00:18:20,847 --> 00:18:23,640
Do you really think they'll believe
you over the heads of the committee?!

270
00:18:23,655 --> 00:18:26,883
We'll simple generate a new list!
"Biggest Liars"!

271
00:18:26,918 --> 00:18:28,592
And put you at the top!

272
00:18:28,628 --> 00:18:33,263
Do yourself a favor, Wendy! Just let it go!
And keep your little mouth shut!

273
00:18:33,598 --> 00:18:34,992
I don't think so!

274
00:18:36,277 --> 00:18:37,643
Stan, run!

275
00:18:37,848 --> 00:18:39,221
Jesus, dude!

276
00:18:46,987 --> 00:18:48,921
Hey, kid, have you seen Kyle?

277
00:18:48,958 --> 00:18:51,413
We've looked everywhere
and we have to show him something.

278
00:18:52,358 --> 00:18:55,720
He's burning down the school.
- What?

279
00:18:55,755 --> 00:18:58,682
He said he gonna burn the school
down to the ground.

280
00:19:05,495 --> 00:19:08,622
All the cruel jokes and ridicule
will finally be over!

281
00:19:08,655 --> 00:19:12,323
Are you happy now, God?!
You made me look like this!

282
00:19:12,358 --> 00:19:15,630
Kyle! Kyle, don't!
- Don't try and stop me, Stan!

283
00:19:15,668 --> 00:19:18,540
You don't know how it feels to be
a deformed monstrosity!

284
00:19:18,576 --> 00:19:20,843
The list was a forgery, Kyle!

285
00:19:21,895 --> 00:19:25,213
It didn't sparkle with all the girls.
We have the real list.

286
00:19:26,156 --> 00:19:30,100
That's about far enough!
Give me that list, Wendy!

287
00:19:30,157 --> 00:19:33,283
Stan, what is going on?!
- It was about shoes, Kyle.

288
00:19:33,318 --> 00:19:35,313
The girls wanted shoes, so they set you up.

289
00:19:35,345 --> 00:19:37,311
Kyle was simple a casualty!

290
00:19:37,347 --> 00:19:40,232
To move Clyde meant that Craig
has to be moved to number twelve,

291
00:19:40,236 --> 00:19:43,320
which moved Jimmy down and moved Jason up!

292
00:19:43,356 --> 00:19:45,000
So what number was I?

293
00:19:45,035 --> 00:19:48,253
You've compromised everything!
Our list's integrity!

294
00:19:48,286 --> 00:19:51,443
Did you see these shoes, Wendy?!
They're incredible!

295
00:19:51,475 --> 00:19:53,913
It doesn't matter how incredible
they are. You can't-

296
00:19:53,918 --> 00:19:56,893
Oh my God, those are amazing.
- Right?

297
00:19:56,925 --> 00:19:59,750
Is that a lace across the top?
- No, it's a little strap.

298
00:19:59,788 --> 00:20:03,592
Wendy?
- But it doesn't matter. You took it too far!

299
00:20:03,626 --> 00:20:07,191
If you hadn't gone all Nancy Drew on us,
this would have just gone away!

300
00:20:07,227 --> 00:20:09,961
She's gonna kill us?
- It's too late, Bebe.

301
00:20:09,985 --> 00:20:13,901
I've already made a full report and sent
a copy to the police. People will know.

302
00:20:13,937 --> 00:20:16,150
Oh please, you're lying.

303
00:20:20,316 --> 00:20:25,420
Give it up, Bebe. We know all about it.
The list was compromised.

304
00:20:25,455 --> 00:20:29,133
Kyle Broflovski is not the ugliest boy
in the class.

305
00:20:36,477 --> 00:20:37,490
Wendy!

306
00:20:53,636 --> 00:20:58,913
Wait, I didn't do anything wrong.
- You can explain all that downtown.

307
00:20:58,946 --> 00:21:00,182
Here, Kyle.

308
00:21:00,217 --> 00:21:04,432
We've been through a lot, but, you can
finally see where you really are on the list.

309
00:21:11,116 --> 00:21:14,983
Are you sure you're okay with this, Kyle?
- I'm sure. Abe Lincoln was right.

310
00:21:15,016 --> 00:21:19,151
I don't wanna find out I'm good-looking
and become a total shithead when I grow up.

311
00:21:19,348 --> 00:21:20,612
Abe Lincoln?

312
00:21:20,707 --> 00:21:23,481
Stan, it's been really great hanging out
with you again.

313
00:21:23,518 --> 00:21:27,413
I feel like you've changed somehow.
In a really awesome way.

314
00:21:27,445 --> 00:21:31,553
Yeah well, I guess a lot of things
change, don't they?



9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
