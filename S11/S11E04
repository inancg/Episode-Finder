<i>Friendly faces everywhere

<i>I'm goin out to south park

00:00:18,161 --> 00:00:21,492
<i>Ample parking day or night

00:00:21,524 --> 00:00:24,683
<i>I'm heading out to south park

00:00:24,714 --> 00:00:28,047
<i>I like girls with big fat titties

00:00:28,078 --> 00:00:31,642
<i>So come on out to south park

<i>Episode 11x04
"The Snuke"</i>

9
00:00:37,027 --> 00:00:39,637
All right, students, let's take our seats.

10
00:00:39,666 --> 00:00:44,410
Everyone try to be nice because we
have a new student joining us today

11
00:00:44,441 --> 00:00:47,828
and I know you'll all make him feel welcome.

12
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:53,189
Say hello to Bahir Hassan Abdul Hakeem.

13
00:00:55,425 --> 00:00:58,347
Welcome to our class, Bahir.
- Thank you.

14
00:00:58,379 --> 00:01:00,111
Dude, not cool!

15
00:01:00,146 --> 00:01:02,682
Why don't you take a seat in Kyle's
empty desk for now?

16
00:01:02,728 --> 00:01:04,061
Okay.

17
00:01:09,198 --> 00:01:13,002
Eric, what the hell is wrong with you?!
- What's wrong?

18
00:01:13,235 --> 00:01:16,061
Has he been checked for bombs?
- Eric, that's enough!

19
00:01:16,097 --> 00:01:18,562
Not all muslim people are terrorists!

20
00:01:18,596 --> 00:01:22,363
No, but most of them are.
And all it takes is most of them.

21
00:01:27,766 --> 00:01:29,820
Now you go, Bahir.

22
00:01:43,185 --> 00:01:45,361
Yeah?
- Kyle, are you on your computer?

23
00:01:45,406 --> 00:01:47,752
What? No, I'm sick.
- Get online.

24
00:01:47,755 --> 00:01:50,563
I need you to check something for me.
- Dude, leave me alone.

25
00:01:50,566 --> 00:01:53,410
Kyle, every one of our friends
might be in serious danger!

26
00:01:53,476 --> 00:01:56,140
What? Why?
- Get online now!

27
00:01:56,185 --> 00:01:57,760
All right, all right.

28
00:01:59,846 --> 00:02:04,622
Go to MySpace. See if there's
a MySpace page for a Bahir Hakeem.

29
00:02:05,117 --> 00:02:06,401
"Bahir Hakeem."

30
00:02:06,406 --> 00:02:09,580
Born in Chicago, eight years old,
his favorite color is green.

31
00:02:09,616 --> 00:02:11,002
Cartman, what is this all about?

32
00:02:11,028 --> 00:02:14,691
Kyle, I want you to check his buddy list.
How many MySpace friends does he have?

33
00:02:14,736 --> 00:02:15,851
Over a hundred.

34
00:02:15,886 --> 00:02:18,942
Look further down the page.
Does he list his favorite band?

35
00:02:18,976 --> 00:02:20,570
White Stripes.

36
00:02:20,737 --> 00:02:22,402
That's funny.
- What?

37
00:02:22,438 --> 00:02:25,702
He told everyone in class today
his favorite band was Blink 182.

38
00:02:30,987 --> 00:02:34,542
<i>The following takes place between
recess and Geography class.</i>

39
00:02:37,065 --> 00:02:38,281
Hello?

40
00:02:38,316 --> 00:02:41,861
Officer Barbrady, South Park Elementary
is in serious danger!

41
00:02:41,897 --> 00:02:43,531
From what? Who is this?

42
00:02:43,588 --> 00:02:46,601
I've just ID'd a muslim
and his MySpace page does not check out.

43
00:02:46,616 --> 00:02:49,120
You've got to get these people out of here now!

44
00:02:49,516 --> 00:02:50,763
Are you serious?

45
00:02:50,796 --> 00:02:53,341
If I wasn't serious,
would I be talking like this?

46
00:02:53,377 --> 00:02:54,291
Like what?

47
00:02:54,318 --> 00:02:56,683
Whispering, but whispering really
loudly for dramatic effect.

48
00:02:56,716 --> 00:02:58,171
Oh jeez.

49
00:03:01,746 --> 00:03:02,922
What the hell?

50
00:03:02,956 --> 00:03:06,940
<i>All students are to evacuate
the school immediately!</i>

51
00:03:11,028 --> 00:03:14,860
Hey, Bahir, since we get to go home,
you wanna come over, play checkers?

52
00:03:14,906 --> 00:03:17,100
Sure, okay.
- Allright!

53
00:03:19,295 --> 00:03:20,463
Dude.

54
00:03:23,808 --> 00:03:24,420
Yeah.

55
00:03:24,447 --> 00:03:26,991
Dude, I just got an IM from Stan
that they evacuated the school.

56
00:03:27,026 --> 00:03:29,092
Yeah. Now do you believe me
that something is going on?!

57
00:03:29,127 --> 00:03:32,103
I guess so.
- Yeah, well I don't like it! It doesn't follow!

58
00:03:32,136 --> 00:03:34,742
What doesn't follow?
- Why would a terrorist just blow up a school?

59
00:03:34,745 --> 00:03:37,372
It's not their M.O. Unless...

60
00:03:38,027 --> 00:03:41,651
Oh my God!
Unless this was all just a big diversion.

61
00:03:42,065 --> 00:03:44,730
Kyle, I need you to Google-search
the South Park Chamber of Commerce!

62
00:03:44,766 --> 00:03:45,592
Okay.

63
00:03:45,626 --> 00:03:49,380
Their website should have a calendar of events,
is there anything big going on in town today?!

64
00:03:49,417 --> 00:03:51,492
Yeah. Actually, there is.
- What?

65
00:03:51,525 --> 00:03:54,081
There's a Hillary Clinton campaign rally.

66
00:03:54,555 --> 00:03:56,612
Cartman?

67
00:03:59,405 --> 00:04:02,771
Sir! There's somebody calling in saying
there's going to be a terrorist attack

68
00:04:02,775 --> 00:04:04,651
on the Hillary Clinton rally today.

69
00:04:04,686 --> 00:04:08,191
What? This is CIA head, Alan Thompson.

70
00:04:08,426 --> 00:04:10,490
Mr. Thompson, you have to call off
the Clinton rally!

71
00:04:10,497 --> 00:04:12,082
There's a terrorist in South Park!

72
00:04:12,127 --> 00:04:12,911
What do you know?

73
00:04:12,935 --> 00:04:15,931
He just showed up out of the blue! I need
to speak with the President right away!

74
00:04:15,967 --> 00:04:20,292
I'm the head of the CIA! You can tell me!
- I said I will only talk to the President!

75
00:04:20,307 --> 00:04:22,711
Look, if you have information of a threat,
you could-

76
00:04:23,578 --> 00:04:25,133
I will have you arrested for-

77
00:04:25,175 --> 00:04:27,812
I can't hear you! Only the president!

78
00:04:30,567 --> 00:04:32,342
Call is coming through now, Mr. President.

79
00:04:32,386 --> 00:04:34,570
Hello?
- President Bush, this is Eric Cartman!

80
00:04:34,607 --> 00:04:36,932
Are we on a secure line?
- Huh? Who.

81
00:04:36,965 --> 00:04:40,171
Look, I know you're not the biggest Hildog fan,
but she is in great danger right now!

82
00:04:40,207 --> 00:04:41,401
Hildog?

83
00:04:45,177 --> 00:04:48,411
Yes, I understand.
I'll let Ms. Clinton know.

84
00:04:48,447 --> 00:04:49,723
What is it, Brian?

85
00:04:49,755 --> 00:04:54,163
Ms. Clinton, we just received word of a
possible terrorist attack on your rally today.

86
00:04:54,198 --> 00:04:55,673
Is the thread credible?

87
00:04:55,718 --> 00:04:58,462
We aren't sure, but perhaps
it's best we call it off.

88
00:04:58,496 --> 00:05:02,062
No. No, I will not be bullied
by terrorist threats.

89
00:05:02,087 --> 00:05:03,721
Your men do a good job, Brian.

90
00:05:03,756 --> 00:05:07,012
I have faith that any thread will
be taken care of accordingly.

91
00:05:07,177 --> 00:05:09,450
We've reached the rally site, Hildog.

92
00:05:12,536 --> 00:05:15,242
Don't worry, Mrs. Clinton,
I'm sure everything will be fine.

93
00:05:15,277 --> 00:05:17,163
Thank you, Chris.

94
00:05:20,367 --> 00:05:24,600
They know about the bomb!
- That is impossible!

95
00:05:24,635 --> 00:05:27,750
We took every measure to assure
the bomb was hidden from sight.

96
00:05:27,876 --> 00:05:30,262
Well somebody tipped off the CIA.

97
00:05:30,298 --> 00:05:33,281
I don't know how much they know,
but security has been heightened.

98
00:05:33,316 --> 00:05:36,501
That bomb must travel with
the Clinton rally to Boston!

99
00:05:36,535 --> 00:05:38,873
The bomb won't make it to Boston now!

100
00:05:38,905 --> 00:05:42,640
With the heightened security, it's only
a matter of time before they find it!

101
00:05:42,958 --> 00:05:47,052
Then we have no choice.
We have to move up the attack.

102
00:05:47,087 --> 00:05:50,183
I understand, comrade.
- Prepare yourself.

103
00:05:50,218 --> 00:05:53,541
We detonate the bomb within the hour.

104
00:05:58,487 --> 00:06:01,403
Kyle, I'm at the Clinton rally site,
but there's no sign of that kid!

105
00:06:01,436 --> 00:06:04,121
So then maybe you're wrong.
- Nope, I'm not wrong.

106
00:06:04,158 --> 00:06:06,923
He must be somehow attacking remotely
from his house. Did you find the address?

107
00:06:06,956 --> 00:06:09,740
Yeah. I cross-referenced his MySpace
page with realtor.com.

108
00:06:09,748 --> 00:06:12,062
His parents moved into that
green house on Janice Street.

109
00:06:12,096 --> 00:06:13,840
Jesus, that's on the other side of town.

110
00:06:13,877 --> 00:06:16,413
All right, Kyle, I'm going to take a picture
with my camera phone and upload it to you.

111
00:06:16,415 --> 00:06:18,292
You ready?
- Yeah.

112
00:06:22,827 --> 00:06:25,312
What is that?
- It's my balls!

113
00:06:26,497 --> 00:06:28,153
Goddamnit Cartman!

114
00:06:28,187 --> 00:06:30,240
Okay. Okay, Kyle, let's stay focused here.

115
00:06:30,707 --> 00:06:36,230
People of South Park, it is my honor to introduce
a woman who deserves nothing but respect.

116
00:06:36,277 --> 00:06:38,641
Mrs. Hillary Rodham Clinton!

117
00:06:42,648 --> 00:06:48,952
It is so nice to be back in a small town
like the one I came from.

118
00:06:50,537 --> 00:06:52,371
Hildog!

119
00:06:53,387 --> 00:06:55,482
Otis Green, anything on that bomb threat?

120
00:06:55,506 --> 00:06:58,042
We have the bomb-smiffing pig
going through the crowd.

121
00:06:58,108 --> 00:07:00,433
If there is a bomb, the pig will find it.

122
00:07:03,728 --> 00:07:07,403
This is why I campaign in small towns
like these!

123
00:07:07,446 --> 00:07:13,390
Because it is in towns like South Park
that you find the true America!

124
00:07:18,715 --> 00:07:21,043
Oh my God, she got a scent!
- What?!

125
00:07:21,076 --> 00:07:23,383
The pig is picking up the smell
of nuclear residue.

126
00:07:23,415 --> 00:07:24,913
Terrorists have hidden a bomb!

127
00:07:24,947 --> 00:07:27,693
Oh my God! Where?!
Where could they have stashed it?!

128
00:07:27,697 --> 00:07:29,681
Come on, find it. Find!

129
00:07:29,718 --> 00:07:31,513
My God, they hid it under the stage?!

130
00:07:31,547 --> 00:07:32,611
No wait, look.

131
00:07:32,637 --> 00:07:35,442
How much money do we have to waste
on needless spending

132
00:07:35,446 --> 00:07:38,631
when we should be focusing
all our attention on...

133
00:07:40,607 --> 00:07:43,011
on the education of all-

134
00:07:43,877 --> 00:07:45,643
There, girl.

135
00:07:46,276 --> 00:07:49,093
On the education of all children.

136
00:07:50,995 --> 00:07:52,593
Oh, I declare!

137
00:07:52,627 --> 00:07:58,021
Oh my God. Do you think they could have
hidden a nuclear device up Mrs. Clinton's...

138
00:07:58,685 --> 00:08:01,641
Mr. Thompson, the kid who called
in the warning was right!

139
00:08:01,678 --> 00:08:05,132
We uncovered intel that terrorists
have obtained a nuclear device

140
00:08:05,138 --> 00:08:08,161
and that they have most likely
hidden it in Mrs. Clinton's...

141
00:08:08,575 --> 00:08:11,620
Well, in her...
- In her what?

142
00:08:12,066 --> 00:08:15,200
In her snatch, sir.
- What?!

143
00:08:15,555 --> 00:08:18,030
What is going on? I wasn't finished.

144
00:08:18,061 --> 00:08:20,588
Security measure, Mrs. Clinton.
Probably nothing.

145
00:08:21,430 --> 00:08:22,189
Yes?

146
00:08:22,195 --> 00:08:25,057
Mr. Jeffries, this is Alan Thompson
with the CIA.

147
00:08:25,089 --> 00:08:30,321
We have reason to believe that Mrs. Clinton
may have a nuclear device up her snatch.

148
00:08:30,358 --> 00:08:32,293
A what?!
- A snatch.

149
00:08:32,326 --> 00:08:37,031
It's the technical term for vagina.
- No, I mean what kind of nuclear device?!

150
00:08:37,777 --> 00:08:39,683
Mr. Jeffries, this is Frank Waters.

151
00:08:39,716 --> 00:08:44,983
It's a suitcase nuke, designed to fit in
a woman's snizz. It's called a snuke.

152
00:08:45,028 --> 00:08:46,673
What is going on, Brian?

153
00:08:46,708 --> 00:08:50,650
Ms. Clinton, it appears that terrorists
have snuck a snuke up your snizz.

154
00:08:50,867 --> 00:08:52,160
Oh my.

155
00:08:52,197 --> 00:08:55,702
What can we do? Can we disable the timer?
- It won't have a timer.

156
00:08:55,746 --> 00:09:00,211
Snukes are detonated remotely. Whoever
our terrorist is has a detonator with him.

157
00:09:00,245 --> 00:09:01,433
But then that means...

158
00:09:01,436 --> 00:09:07,010
Yes. If we don't find that detonator, everyone
in the town of South Park is going to die.

159
00:09:07,496 --> 00:09:09,213
Forever.

160
00:09:15,497 --> 00:09:18,953
Do we have that phone trace?
- The call is going through now, sir.

161
00:09:19,988 --> 00:09:22,242
Yeah?
- This is CIA head Alan Thompson.

162
00:09:22,247 --> 00:09:24,153
We spoke before about the-
- Yes, Mr. Thompson?

163
00:09:24,186 --> 00:09:27,002
Well, we've just arrived in your town.
- Why? Did you find something?

164
00:09:27,035 --> 00:09:31,123
Yes. There's a suitcase nuke
in Ms. Clinton's snizz.

165
00:09:31,365 --> 00:09:33,463
A snuke?
- That's right.

166
00:09:33,496 --> 00:09:35,381
It's controlled by a remote detonator.

167
00:09:35,387 --> 00:09:37,740
We have to locate the terrorist
before he sets it off.

168
00:09:37,777 --> 00:09:39,830
I have the address of the house
the terrorist moved into.

169
00:09:39,837 --> 00:09:41,312
I'm almost there now, where are you?

170
00:09:41,325 --> 00:09:44,202
We're on the town's main street,
right by an ice cream shop.

171
00:09:44,236 --> 00:09:46,370
Oh dude, I'm, I'm right next to you.

172
00:09:47,125 --> 00:09:48,592
Oh, hey.

173
00:09:49,917 --> 00:09:53,283
Dude, we totally got let out of school.
- I know. Something big is going on.

174
00:09:53,317 --> 00:09:56,922
Take a look at this. I did a Google search
for "Hillary Clinton Campaign Rally" right?

175
00:09:56,958 --> 00:10:00,360
And one of the links was to YouTube, where
this Russian guy had a bunch of videos.

176
00:10:00,407 --> 00:10:03,182
Russian?
- Yeah, this guy, Vladimir Stolfsky.

177
00:10:03,225 --> 00:10:07,022
He had videos on YouTube of every single rally.
- So he's a Hillary Clinton fan.

178
00:10:07,057 --> 00:10:09,683
No. I cross-referenced his
YouTube profile with MySpace

179
00:10:09,686 --> 00:10:12,152
and according to his blog,
he's an old-school Communist.

180
00:10:12,187 --> 00:10:14,692
So what's he doing at every Clinton rally?

181
00:10:14,738 --> 00:10:17,491
Do a WebCrawler search, maybe he
has podcasts up somewhere.

182
00:10:17,526 --> 00:10:18,902
Oh that's a good idea.

183
00:10:20,488 --> 00:10:23,042
What is going on? What have we done?

184
00:10:23,075 --> 00:10:25,362
They claim they don't know anything
about an attack.

185
00:10:25,398 --> 00:10:26,552
Big surprise!

186
00:10:26,587 --> 00:10:30,193
Sir, first pass of the house, we didn't
find a snuke detonator anywhere.

187
00:10:30,228 --> 00:10:32,610
We thought he was at school.

188
00:10:32,645 --> 00:10:35,640
We thought he was at school.
He's not at school?

189
00:10:37,058 --> 00:10:40,020
You're doing great, Ms. Clinton.
- Do they know how long, Brian?

190
00:10:40,058 --> 00:10:42,762
How long before the snuke in
my snizz goes off?

191
00:10:42,798 --> 00:10:45,171
They'll find the detonator, Hildog.

192
00:10:45,206 --> 00:10:47,422
We can't wait for them to find the detonator.

193
00:10:47,455 --> 00:10:50,492
If we can get to the bomb,
maybe we can deactivate it.

194
00:10:50,526 --> 00:10:54,333
Can't somebody go and take a loo
inside Mrs. Clinton's snizz?

195
00:10:55,316 --> 00:10:57,763
I'm not sending any of my men in there.

196
00:10:58,676 --> 00:11:01,301
Are you almost ready to set off the bomb?

197
00:11:01,338 --> 00:11:04,711
Everything is set. We have
the detonator up and running.

198
00:11:08,857 --> 00:11:13,553
Mr. Hakeem, we need to know where your son is!
- I tell you, I do not know.

199
00:11:15,697 --> 00:11:19,143
This is getting us nowhere.
If he knows anything, he's not saying.

200
00:11:19,175 --> 00:11:21,723
Let me have time with him.
- What are you going to do?

201
00:11:21,755 --> 00:11:25,213
We have to find that detonator!
Let me have time with him!

202
00:11:27,475 --> 00:11:31,291
You will tell me where your son is!
- He should be at school!

203
00:11:38,408 --> 00:11:39,690
Hey!

204
00:11:41,158 --> 00:11:44,692
Where is the detonator?!
- What detonator are you ta-

205
00:11:47,137 --> 00:11:50,893
I can do this all day.
- I don't know anything about a-

206
00:11:54,408 --> 00:11:57,411
Stop it! Really!
- You can make it stop!

207
00:11:57,437 --> 00:11:58,843
I don't have the-

208
00:12:01,585 --> 00:12:03,551
Are we just gonna let this go on?

209
00:12:04,408 --> 00:12:08,210
Okay, I got a text of the Russian guy's
podcast. It's all a bunch of links to eBay.

210
00:12:08,247 --> 00:12:11,731
You should be able to search his username on
eBay and see what he's been buying and selling.

211
00:12:11,856 --> 00:12:14,651
Ferris, set up over there.
Two of you can take that bed area.

212
00:12:14,715 --> 00:12:17,550
Hey!
- Donner, take over that station.

213
00:12:17,988 --> 00:12:18,891
What's going on?

214
00:12:18,957 --> 00:12:22,500
This apartment is being absorbed
by Homeland Security!

215
00:12:22,707 --> 00:12:24,080
Homeland Security?

216
00:12:24,118 --> 00:12:26,731
Look, your little game of going
over people's heads is over!

217
00:12:26,756 --> 00:12:29,801
You could still work, but from now on
you answer to me, you got that?!

218
00:12:29,835 --> 00:12:32,282
Excuse me, who's in charge here?!
- I am!

219
00:12:32,316 --> 00:12:36,071
Yeah well not anymore you're not. This
apartment has just been assigned to the FBI.

220
00:12:36,105 --> 00:12:39,582
That's outrageous! On whose orders?!
- On order of the Secretary of Defense!

221
00:12:39,585 --> 00:12:41,371
You had your shot, now I'm in charge!

222
00:12:41,416 --> 00:12:44,570
Not anymore you're not!
Orders just came down from Central!

223
00:12:44,577 --> 00:12:46,733
They want ATF handling this on all fronts!

224
00:12:46,757 --> 00:12:48,931
All right people, from now on
you're answering to me!

225
00:12:48,957 --> 00:12:51,760
Not anymore they're not!
Orders from the President.

226
00:12:51,807 --> 00:12:55,702
He wants this handled by his staff personally!
Now Nelson is in charge.

227
00:12:55,737 --> 00:12:57,860
Not anymore I'm not!

228
00:13:00,687 --> 00:13:04,950
What are you going to do to my wife?!
- Nothing if you tell me where your son is!

229
00:13:04,986 --> 00:13:07,322
We told you, we don't know.

230
00:13:07,438 --> 00:13:09,600
Do you know what this is?!

231
00:13:10,215 --> 00:13:14,513
This is apple juice.
It gives super bad farts.

232
00:13:15,517 --> 00:13:17,743
Did he just inject himself with apple juice?

233
00:13:17,778 --> 00:13:20,751
Where is your son?!
- She doesn't know either.

234
00:13:22,916 --> 00:13:26,860
I mean it! Stop! That is disgusting!
Where is your mother?!

235
00:13:30,675 --> 00:13:32,113
Answer it!

236
00:13:32,506 --> 00:13:36,230
Hallo? Hallo Bahir.
Where are you?

237
00:13:36,756 --> 00:13:39,293
Who it Butters?
- Butters.

238
00:13:39,328 --> 00:13:42,633
Bahir, one of your classmates
is keeping us hostage.

239
00:13:44,558 --> 00:13:47,032
You filthy little rapscallion!

240
00:13:47,088 --> 00:13:50,443
We got him! I know where he is!
- All right, where? We'll send our people in.

241
00:13:50,488 --> 00:13:53,422
No no, he's my lead.
- You're not going alone.

242
00:13:53,458 --> 00:13:56,353
You blow in there and you risk taking
him down without finding the detonator!

243
00:13:56,388 --> 00:13:58,281
I'm going to find out where it is!

244
00:13:59,108 --> 00:14:02,631
All right, people, I'm in charge now
and we will find the terrorists.

245
00:14:02,665 --> 00:14:05,583
Jarvis, I want you to check for
any terrorist chatter on AOL.

246
00:14:05,615 --> 00:14:09,723
Marley and Greggs, try searching
for nuclear devices on askjeeves.com.

247
00:14:09,757 --> 00:14:12,563
Ask Jeeves? Nobody uses Ask Jeeves!
Just Google-search it!

248
00:14:12,597 --> 00:14:14,883
Are you telling me how to do my job?
- Yes.

249
00:14:14,915 --> 00:14:16,891
There's a Russian guy named Vladimir Stolfsky

250
00:14:16,896 --> 00:14:18,721
who's got search engine hits all
over this thing.

251
00:14:18,756 --> 00:14:22,921
Chase, search the name Stolfsky on YouTube
and cross-reference it with JDate!

252
00:14:23,045 --> 00:14:23,922
Checking.

253
00:14:23,957 --> 00:14:25,842
Look, these Russian guys all have blogs
talking about this

254
00:14:25,846 --> 00:14:28,201
like it's just some big diversion
for something much bigger!

255
00:14:28,236 --> 00:14:31,701
Sir, these kids are right. We've just
received intel that Russian terrorists

256
00:14:31,705 --> 00:14:33,801
are believed to be responsible
for the threat.

257
00:14:33,848 --> 00:14:36,793
Where's the intel from?
- We just read it on Drudge Report.

258
00:14:36,827 --> 00:14:38,410
Look, we already have the guy's blog.

259
00:14:38,416 --> 00:14:40,773
Maybe we can find an address
and check it out on MapQuest.

260
00:14:40,807 --> 00:14:43,673
We do this my way!
I'm the one in charge!

261
00:14:44,246 --> 00:14:47,433
Not anymore you're not.
- Oh, snap.

262
00:14:49,435 --> 00:14:51,653
I captured another one of your pieces, Bahir.

263
00:14:54,695 --> 00:14:56,181
Oh hey Eric.

264
00:14:56,228 --> 00:14:58,240
Where is the detonator!
- The what?

265
00:14:58,276 --> 00:15:02,162
You have exactly five seconds before I start
dropping serious apple juice farts on your face!

266
00:15:02,197 --> 00:15:04,602
One!
- Leave me alone!

267
00:15:04,777 --> 00:15:06,113
Stop!

268
00:15:06,168 --> 00:15:08,191
Hey, I was about to win!

269
00:15:08,307 --> 00:15:11,193
Stop, terrorist, or I will shoot you!

270
00:15:14,255 --> 00:15:16,252
Get in the van!

271
00:15:17,967 --> 00:15:21,391
Uh, that's cool.
I'm actually not playing anymore.

272
00:15:21,687 --> 00:15:23,521
Get in the van!

273
00:15:24,418 --> 00:15:26,423
That's it! We don't have a choice anymore!

274
00:15:26,436 --> 00:15:30,471
Somebody is going to have to go in
and try to disarm the snuke manually!

275
00:15:30,506 --> 00:15:34,632
No, it's too dangerous! That snatch
has not seen action in over 30 years!

276
00:15:34,666 --> 00:15:36,471
It could be toxic!

277
00:15:36,817 --> 00:15:40,843
I'll do it!
I'll check out Ms. Clinton's snizz.

278
00:15:44,606 --> 00:15:47,602
Let me go! Please! I am just a little boy!

279
00:15:47,638 --> 00:15:50,621
You called and warned the government
of our plans!

280
00:15:50,668 --> 00:15:53,983
What you don't know is that we
are merely mercenaries!

281
00:15:54,015 --> 00:15:58,983
We were paid to set up the snuke so that
the real enemy of America could attack!

282
00:15:59,016 --> 00:16:01,192
That's cool. I'm fine with muslims invading.

283
00:16:01,227 --> 00:16:05,382
You really think Muslims are behind
this terrorist threat?!

284
00:16:05,736 --> 00:16:07,692
Uh yes, of course?

285
00:16:07,725 --> 00:16:13,533
America had other enemies before the Muslims,
you know. Who is America's oldest enemy?

286
00:16:14,138 --> 00:16:16,763
The Russians?
- Before that.

287
00:16:16,807 --> 00:16:19,963
The Germans?
- Before that.

288
00:16:20,007 --> 00:16:22,380
The Germans again?
- Before that!

289
00:16:22,406 --> 00:16:28,831
I am talking about the oldest threat to America!
The greatest enemy America has ever known!

290
00:16:28,878 --> 00:16:31,051
You can't possible mean...

291
00:16:35,496 --> 00:16:41,883
Two hundred years we've waited. Finally.
We will get those traitors to the Crown!

292
00:16:43,877 --> 00:16:45,732
Yes, Your Majesty?

293
00:16:45,768 --> 00:16:49,253
The Russians are ready to set off
the diversion.

294
00:16:49,285 --> 00:16:50,782
Full sail.

295
00:16:50,826 --> 00:16:52,801
Full sail, your Majesty.

296
00:17:03,416 --> 00:17:04,911
All right, Brian, this is it.

297
00:17:04,946 --> 00:17:08,631
Get in there and see if you can disarm
the snuke in Ms. Clinton's snatch.

298
00:17:11,167 --> 00:17:14,370
All right. I'm nearing her snizz now.

299
00:17:15,108 --> 00:17:16,343
God help him.

300
00:17:16,377 --> 00:17:20,561
What do you see, Brian?
- It's dark. Cold.

301
00:17:20,597 --> 00:17:25,831
You're doing fine, Brian. Get as close as
you can. You have to look inside the snizz.

302
00:17:28,767 --> 00:17:31,093
Allright, I'm,looking.

303
00:17:31,468 --> 00:17:34,433
Yes, I see...
I see the device!

304
00:17:36,148 --> 00:17:38,213
You're doing great, Brian. Hang in there.

305
00:17:38,246 --> 00:17:43,790
There's um, metal housing some kind of
three-pronged triggering mechanism that...

306
00:17:43,906 --> 00:17:47,032
Wait there's something else here!

307
00:17:47,078 --> 00:17:48,670
There's something...

308
00:17:48,736 --> 00:17:49,911
Say again, Brian.

309
00:17:49,947 --> 00:17:53,393
There's something perched on the snuke's coil.

310
00:17:53,436 --> 00:17:55,382
Oh God, it's looking at me!

311
00:17:55,417 --> 00:17:59,002
Brian, get out of there!
- What are you?!

312
00:17:59,316 --> 00:18:03,703
I have no qualm with you!
Stay back! Stay back I-

313
00:18:04,258 --> 00:18:10,803
Brian? Brian, what's happening?
- It's eating my head! It's eating my head!

314
00:18:13,268 --> 00:18:14,852
Oh my!

315
00:18:16,207 --> 00:18:17,620
I got it! I got it!

316
00:18:17,676 --> 00:18:20,242
According to PayPal, the Russian guys
are just hired mercenaries

317
00:18:20,245 --> 00:18:22,410
who had ads up on Craig's List
and got paid through eBay.

318
00:18:22,415 --> 00:18:25,503
So that person could be attacked
by the British.

319
00:18:25,547 --> 00:18:28,460
The British?
- Loyalist Red Coats!

320
00:18:28,496 --> 00:18:32,923
Sir, I found the Russian's eHarmony account!
It does list an address in South Park!

321
00:18:32,957 --> 00:18:36,552
All right! MapQuest the address!
- I'll use Google Maps. It has live traffic.

322
00:18:36,585 --> 00:18:37,413
Good thinking.

323
00:18:37,426 --> 00:18:40,850
Sir, we have the terrorists' location.
IM'ing you now.

324
00:18:41,717 --> 00:18:45,940
It was good knowing you, comrade.
- Please. Think about what you are doing.

325
00:18:45,977 --> 00:18:48,293
The British are just using you,
you're going to die.

326
00:18:48,338 --> 00:18:51,061
Yes, but we will be rich.

327
00:18:51,096 --> 00:18:54,570
<i>Left flank, prig prang and clear! Go!</i>

328
00:18:56,687 --> 00:19:00,400
The game is over! Get down on the ground!
- How did they find us?

329
00:19:00,437 --> 00:19:04,271
We know about everything! Your diversion
to help the Red Coats is over!

330
00:19:04,308 --> 00:19:07,543
It doesn't matter.
The detonator is on a timer.

331
00:19:07,576 --> 00:19:12,773
You are too late!
In three minutes!

332
00:19:16,956 --> 00:19:18,461
What the hell?!

333
00:19:18,507 --> 00:19:21,510
The power went out!
- Well so then what time is it?

334
00:19:24,325 --> 00:19:27,603
Oh crap.
- Take 'em down!

335
00:19:31,517 --> 00:19:35,492
No! I don't want to die without being paid!

336
00:19:39,997 --> 00:19:43,540
The detonator is secured, general.
You are cleared to proceed.

337
00:19:51,018 --> 00:19:53,400
The Rebel Americans know of our attack?!

338
00:19:53,435 --> 00:19:55,902
How?
- Fire at will!

339
00:20:06,338 --> 00:20:07,473
Yes?

340
00:20:07,506 --> 00:20:10,481
Your Majesty, the attack has failed.

341
00:20:10,515 --> 00:20:15,052
We were unable to end the American Revolution.

342
00:20:15,337 --> 00:20:16,792
I see.

343
00:20:22,425 --> 00:20:26,092
Well, looks like we saved our country
from British rule once again.

344
00:20:26,128 --> 00:20:29,232
Yeah. It just proves we need to learn
not to profile one race of people.

345
00:20:29,267 --> 00:20:32,021
Because, actually,
most of the world hates us.

346
00:20:32,056 --> 00:20:35,170
Well Bahir, I was thinking that maybe
I owe you an apology.

347
00:20:35,206 --> 00:20:36,270
Really?
- Yes.

348
00:20:36,275 --> 00:20:38,333
But then I realized that technically,
I don't.

349
00:20:38,366 --> 00:20:41,403
Because by being suspicious of you
I saved your life and everyone else's.

350
00:20:41,436 --> 00:20:44,790
So really, you own me an apology.
But that's cool.

351
00:20:44,827 --> 00:20:49,101
You didn't save everyone, I did!
You were just out harrassing muslims!

352
00:20:49,376 --> 00:20:52,221
But if I hadn't called you in the first place
to check out the muslim

353
00:20:52,227 --> 00:20:54,590
you would have just stayed
in bed sick all day, right?

354
00:20:54,866 --> 00:20:56,721
Maybe.
- Maybe?

355
00:20:56,756 --> 00:20:59,460
If I hadn't called you, you wouldn't have been
on your computer checking out the Clinton rally.

356
00:20:59,475 --> 00:21:02,471
That means my intolerance of muslims
saved America.

357
00:21:02,815 --> 00:21:04,203
That is so missing the point.

358
00:21:04,245 --> 00:21:07,703
Me being a bigot stopped a nuclear bomb
from going off, yes or no?!

359
00:21:07,735 --> 00:21:10,573
That's not the right way to look at it, I-
- Yes or no, Kyle?!

360
00:21:10,607 --> 00:21:13,181
No! Not, not like you're saying.

361
00:21:13,227 --> 00:21:16,061
But that's all I'm saying:
today, bigotry and racism saved the day.

362
00:21:16,105 --> 00:21:17,361
Bahir, you get this, right?

363
00:21:17,397 --> 00:21:22,073
Bahir! Get away from that disgusting child!
Get back home and start packing your things!

364
00:21:22,077 --> 00:21:25,023
We are leaving this whole intolerant country!

365
00:21:29,835 --> 00:21:33,251
Okay. Who got rid of the Muslims, huh?

366
00:21:33,296 --> 00:21:36,613
That was all me.
Simple thank you will suffice.
