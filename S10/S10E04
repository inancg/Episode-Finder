1
00:00:03,342 --> 00:00:06,470
I'm going out to South Park
gonna have myself a time

2
00:00:06,678 --> 00:00:09,806
Friendly faces everywhere
humble folks without temptation

3
00:00:10,025 --> 00:00:13,143
I'm goin out to south park
gonna leave my woes behind

4
00:00:13,352 --> 00:00:16,480
Ample parking day or night
people spouting howdy neighbor

5
00:00:16,688 --> 00:00:19,608
I'm heading out to south park
to see if i cant unwind

6
00:00:19,816 --> 00:00:22,945
I like girls with big fat titties
really big fat titties

7
00:00:23,153 --> 00:00:25,020
So come on out to south park
and meet some friends of mine

8
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:27,320
Episode 10x04
"Cartoon Wars Part II"

9
00:00:28,081 --> 00:00:30,248
<i>Previously on South Park...</i>

10
00:00:30,345 --> 00:00:35,842
<i>The popular cartoon, Family Guy, is going
to show the image of Muhammad uncensored!</i>

11
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:38,102
If we all bury our heads in sand

12
00:00:38,110 --> 00:00:40,273
we can avoid being any part of this.

13
00:00:40,313 --> 00:00:44,027
I'm gonna do whatever I can. To get that
episode pulled before this gets out of hand.

14
00:00:44,227 --> 00:00:46,213
You just want Family Guy off the air...

15
00:00:47,644 --> 00:00:48,865
Kyle, stop it!

16
00:00:48,908 --> 00:00:50,199
So long, Kyle!

17
00:00:50,283 --> 00:00:52,609
You son of a bitch!
I won't let you win!

18
00:00:52,934 --> 00:00:57,951
Mr. President, there's something about the
Family Guy writing staff I think you should know.

19
00:00:58,393 --> 00:01:02,923
<i>And now, the thrilling conclusion of...
Cartoon Wars.</i>

20
00:01:02,937 --> 00:01:04,479
<i>Will not be seen tonight!</i>

21
00:01:04,507 --> 00:01:08,266
<i>So that we can bring you this
Terrance & Phillip Television Special</i>

22
00:01:17,507 --> 00:01:21,451
Say Terrance, isn't it wonderful having
a holiday here at the Lazy "J" Ranch?

23
00:01:21,493 --> 00:01:25,580
It sure is, Phillip. But I do believe
this steer I'm riding has the farts.

24
00:01:28,971 --> 00:01:33,762
Oh, look who's coming! Isn't that Muhammad,
the holy prophet of the Muslim religion?

25
00:01:36,122 --> 00:01:38,331
Hey guys, how's it going?

26
00:01:39,358 --> 00:01:42,095
Hello Muhammad,
we've read all aboat you in the Koran.

27
00:01:42,136 --> 00:01:44,171
I'm hear to investigate a murder.

28
00:01:44,306 --> 00:01:47,084
All right, just what the hell is going on here?!

29
00:01:47,209 --> 00:01:50,455
You censored out the image
of Muhammad in our television special!

30
00:01:50,608 --> 00:01:54,677
Ey! You guys know the rules! Nobody can show
the image of Muhammad anymore. It's dangerous.

31
00:01:54,723 --> 00:01:56,267
But you ruined the whole show!

32
00:01:56,295 --> 00:01:58,628
Look, I'm not gonna risk the lives
of the people at this network.

33
00:01:58,656 --> 00:02:00,642
Let's just forget aboat it, okay guys?

34
00:02:03,336 --> 00:02:04,781
Aw, come on guys, give me a break.

35
00:02:04,809 --> 00:02:09,029
We demand you rerun Mystery at the Lazy
"J" Ranch with Muhammad uncensored!

36
00:02:09,071 --> 00:02:11,127
Ey! I run this network, not you guys!

37
00:02:11,154 --> 00:02:12,975
And if you ask me,
your show has become so preachy

38
00:02:12,976 --> 00:02:15,407
and full of messages that you've
forgotten how to be funny! No Muhammad!

39
00:02:15,421 --> 00:02:19,143
But Family Guy is going to show Muhammad
on an episode that airs tonight!

40
00:02:19,267 --> 00:02:20,293
I doubt it!

41
00:02:20,294 --> 00:02:24,336
I'll bet that right now, somebody is on their way
to FOX Network to demand that that episode be pulled.

42
00:02:36,183 --> 00:02:39,627
Ma'am, I need to speak to the president
of this network right away.

43
00:02:39,710 --> 00:02:41,335
What is it regarding?

44
00:02:41,447 --> 00:02:42,978
It's regarding Family Guy.

45
00:02:42,992 --> 00:02:45,929
I demand that the Muhammad episode
be pulled before it airs tonight!

46
00:02:46,068 --> 00:02:49,603
It's incendiary, it's offensive to Muslims
and people can get hurt!

47
00:02:49,631 --> 00:02:51,756
It's wrong!
It's wrooong!

48
00:02:52,213 --> 00:02:56,380
Okay, but if you've got a problem with
Family Guy, you'll have to wait in line.

49
00:02:56,410 --> 00:03:00,743
That little boy over there has an appointment
to try and get Family Guy off the air altogether.

50
00:03:04,062 --> 00:03:05,437
Dude, can I go before you?

51
00:03:05,465 --> 00:03:06,999
Eat my shorts!

52
00:03:13,922 --> 00:03:15,575
What the hell is going on?

53
00:03:18,734 --> 00:03:19,721
Hello?

54
00:03:20,582 --> 00:03:23,207
Excuse me, I need to get to Los Angeles.

55
00:03:23,943 --> 00:03:24,776
Hey!

56
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:30,605
Hello?!

57
00:03:31,105 --> 00:03:34,091
<i>...starting in a small town
in central Colorado.</i>

58
00:03:34,091 --> 00:03:37,150
<i>The idea has now spread all over America.</i>

59
00:03:37,302 --> 00:03:39,566
<i>Muslims continue to riot in the Middle East,</i>

60
00:03:39,566 --> 00:03:43,302
<i>demanding that Family Guy
not air tonight's episode.</i>

61
00:03:43,389 --> 00:03:45,930
<i>And Muslim terrorists continue to make threats.</i>

62
00:03:47,002 --> 00:03:50,197
<i>"Family Guy" better not show Mohammed tonight.</i>

63
00:03:50,484 --> 00:03:52,082
<i>I'm serious.</i>

64
00:03:52,289 --> 00:03:53,621
<i>"Family Guy" isn't funny.</i>

65
00:03:54,122 --> 00:03:56,316
<i>Osama bin Laden had this to say:</i>

66
00:03:59,264 --> 00:04:02,185
<i>If you look closely at
the writing in "Family Guy",</i>

67
00:04:03,352 --> 00:04:06,189
<i>you will see that the jokes
never derive from the plot,</i>

68
00:04:07,356 --> 00:04:09,016
<i>and I think that's totally gay.</i>

69
00:04:09,483 --> 00:04:13,853
<i>Bin Laden went on to say that if Family Guy
shows the image of Muhammad as planned,</i>

70
00:04:13,853 --> 00:04:17,249
<i>the terrorist retaliation will be immediate.</i>

71
00:04:18,454 --> 00:04:19,802
You one of them?

72
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:20,538
Who?

73
00:04:20,593 --> 00:04:22,635
How come your head ain't in the sand?

74
00:04:30,172 --> 00:04:31,199
So...

75
00:04:31,213 --> 00:04:33,561
you don't like Family Guy either, huh?

76
00:04:34,151 --> 00:04:37,094
I hate Family Guy.

77
00:04:37,623 --> 00:04:38,715
So what's your plan?

78
00:04:38,715 --> 00:04:41,979
You're gonna ask the president of the network
nicely to take it off the air?

79
00:04:42,391 --> 00:04:43,867
Not nicely.

80
00:04:44,006 --> 00:04:48,639
Look, kid, if you hate a TV show,
all you have to do is get an episode pulled.

81
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:51,347
Pretty soon the show is compromised
and it goes off the air.

82
00:04:51,431 --> 00:04:52,611
Cool, man.

83
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:55,382
Yes. So my plan is to use
this whole Muhammad thing

84
00:04:55,382 --> 00:04:58,067
as a way to scare the network
into pulling tonight's show.

85
00:04:58,109 --> 00:05:00,599
I'm going to use fear to get
them to do what I want.

86
00:05:01,696 --> 00:05:03,835
Isn't that like, terrorism?

87
00:05:04,321 --> 00:05:08,135
No, it isn't like terrorism.
It is terrorism.

88
00:05:08,232 --> 00:05:09,357
I could do that.

89
00:05:09,371 --> 00:05:12,129
This is manipulation at its highest level,
you should let me handle this.

90
00:05:12,139 --> 00:05:13,833
I'm a pretty bad kid.

91
00:05:13,903 --> 00:05:16,042
Really?
What's the worst thing you've ever done?

92
00:05:16,083 --> 00:05:18,380
Ukrad³em kiedyœ g³owê z pomnika.

93
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:21,504
Wow, that's pretty hardcore.
Geez.

94
00:05:21,713 --> 00:05:23,879
That's like this one time,
when I didn't like a kid,

95
00:05:23,879 --> 00:05:27,141
so I ground his parents up into chili
and fed it to him.

96
00:05:29,897 --> 00:05:31,619
You got it, man.
You got it.

97
00:05:32,258 --> 00:05:32,746
Seeya.

98
00:05:37,191 --> 00:05:40,719
I want to assure the American
people that as President,

99
00:05:40,719 --> 00:05:43,371
I have exhausted every possible solution.

100
00:05:43,371 --> 00:05:48,650
Unfortunately, Mohammed will appear
uncensored on Family Guy tonight at seven.

101
00:05:51,359 --> 00:05:54,192
Mr. President, can't the writers
of the show be reasoned with?

102
00:05:54,192 --> 00:05:56,414
Don't they know they're
putting the country in danger?

103
00:05:57,336 --> 00:06:02,086
I have come to... understand something
about the Family Guy writing staff.

104
00:06:02,332 --> 00:06:07,119
Suffice it to say that they will not be
persuaded by the possibility of violence.

105
00:06:09,688 --> 00:06:13,702
What exactly did you learn about
the Family Guy writing staff, Mr. President?

106
00:06:14,839 --> 00:06:16,964
I'm afraid that information is classified.

107
00:06:20,609 --> 00:06:25,526
Mr. President, can't you force the Family Guy
writing staff not to write anything about Mohammed?

108
00:06:25,567 --> 00:06:27,120
Couldn't you throw them in prison?

109
00:06:27,151 --> 00:06:30,701
Look! The fact of the matter is
the Family Guy writing staff

110
00:06:30,701 --> 00:06:34,104
is protected by something
called the First Amendment!

111
00:06:34,368 --> 00:06:38,006
And what exactly is
this First Amendment, Mr. President?

112
00:06:39,854 --> 00:06:42,225
Uh you know, the right to free speech.

113
00:06:47,448 --> 00:06:51,406
Mr. President, when your administration
came up with this "First Amendment",

114
00:06:51,406 --> 00:06:54,428
did it not foresee a problem
like this might happen?

115
00:06:55,303 --> 00:06:56,053
Well...

116
00:06:56,053 --> 00:06:59,692
We didn't come up with the First Amendment.
It was already in place.

117
00:06:59,734 --> 00:07:03,632
What do you intend to do about
this "First Amendment," Mr. President?

118
00:07:03,688 --> 00:07:05,300
Forgive me, Mr. President,

119
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:09,481
but this "First Amendment" sounds like
a lot of bureaucratic jibbery-joob?

120
00:07:15,294 --> 00:07:17,516
Okay, let's discuss the fall lineup.

121
00:07:17,562 --> 00:07:19,565
Sir, there's still one little boy out here

122
00:07:19,565 --> 00:07:22,495
who wants to speak with you
about pulling the Family Guy episode.

123
00:07:22,551 --> 00:07:24,460
All right, let's get this over with.

124
00:07:26,965 --> 00:07:28,896
Hello, gentlemen, ladies.

125
00:07:28,965 --> 00:07:32,340
My name is little Danny Pocket.
And I won't take much of your time.

126
00:07:32,730 --> 00:07:36,341
Please excuse my tiny crutch,
it's the only way I can get around these days.

127
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:39,064
Oh, poor kid...

128
00:07:39,542 --> 00:07:40,542
You see,

129
00:07:40,556 --> 00:07:43,662
my father worked for a newspaper
in my native country of Denmark.

130
00:07:43,716 --> 00:07:45,885
His newspaper showed
an image of Muhammad and,

131
00:07:45,926 --> 00:07:49,093
two days later,
terrorists suicides bombed his building.

132
00:07:49,329 --> 00:07:50,962
I was in the lobby when it happened.

133
00:07:51,018 --> 00:07:54,170
First one terrorist suicide bombed us
and then dozens more.

134
00:07:54,254 --> 00:07:55,434
They just kept coming.

135
00:07:55,559 --> 00:07:58,545
Suicide bombers running in the building
and blowing up one after another!

136
00:07:58,670 --> 00:08:00,798
They were like Mexican jumping beans.

137
00:08:02,937 --> 00:08:05,743
I just don't wanna see people here
at your studio getting hurt, because...

138
00:08:05,993 --> 00:08:08,827
that would be, of course, your responsibility.

139
00:08:11,868 --> 00:08:13,352
I feel terrible.

140
00:08:13,743 --> 00:08:18,659
It's so east to put terrorism out of mind until
one of its victims is staring you in the face.

141
00:08:18,729 --> 00:08:23,075
Sir, if we pull the episode, the Family Guy
writing staff will refuse to work again.

142
00:08:23,534 --> 00:08:26,617
Little boy, will you talk
to the Family Guy writing staff?

143
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:30,576
If your story touches their
hearts like it has ours,

144
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:33,592
perhaps they'll back down from
demanding we air the episode.

145
00:08:33,710 --> 00:08:35,543
I'll certainly do my best.

146
00:08:36,223 --> 00:08:38,677
Take this noble child over
to the Family Guy offices.

147
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:43,219
If he can scare them like he has us,
maybe we can pull the Muhammad episode after all.

148
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:45,597
Yes, and then Family Guy is as good as dead.

149
00:08:45,652 --> 00:08:47,928
What was that?
- I said "thank you".

150
00:08:48,333 --> 00:08:49,610
Thank you for listening.

151
00:08:55,705 --> 00:08:56,733
Thanks a lot for the ride.

152
00:08:56,993 --> 00:08:58,743
Ey, it's the least I could do.

153
00:08:58,854 --> 00:09:00,465
I hope you succeed, kid.

154
00:09:00,596 --> 00:09:04,679
I really don't wanna see Family Guy
go off the air. I love that show!

155
00:09:04,985 --> 00:09:06,264
I'll do everything I can.

156
00:09:06,319 --> 00:09:09,666
I mean, I know it's just joke
after joke, but I like that.

157
00:09:09,778 --> 00:09:13,322
At least it doesn't get all preachy
and up its own ass with messages, you know?

158
00:09:22,839 --> 00:09:23,964
Excuse me.

159
00:09:24,908 --> 00:09:27,033
Do you know which way
the network president's office is?

160
00:09:27,185 --> 00:09:28,547
Who wants to know?!

161
00:09:28,658 --> 00:09:32,614
Look, my fat bastard friend is trying to trick
the network into getting Family Guy off the air.

162
00:09:34,712 --> 00:09:37,394
The network president's office is in there!

163
00:09:38,946 --> 00:09:41,724
Oh thanks, dude.
- No problem, man.

164
00:09:44,266 --> 00:09:45,071
Hello?

165
00:09:46,321 --> 00:09:47,440
This can't be right, I-

166
00:09:48,732 --> 00:09:51,246
Cowabunga, motherfucker!

167
00:09:55,023 --> 00:09:57,537
Hello Mitchell.
- Oh hi, Miss Travis.

168
00:09:57,607 --> 00:10:00,366
The president has asked
that little Danny Pocket here

169
00:10:00,366 --> 00:10:02,797
speak with the Family Guy writing staff.

170
00:10:03,144 --> 00:10:06,234
Are you sure?
They're working on a new episode right now.

171
00:10:06,289 --> 00:10:07,763
It won't take long, sir.

172
00:10:09,624 --> 00:10:12,346
All right, I'll take him back.
Follow me, little Danny.

173
00:10:13,346 --> 00:10:16,360
You must be excited.
Not many people get to meet our writing staff.

174
00:10:16,402 --> 00:10:19,524
Yes, I'm totally excited.
Family Guy is so funny.

175
00:10:21,190 --> 00:10:22,607
Well, here we are.

176
00:10:22,843 --> 00:10:25,548
Danny, the Family Guy writing staff.

177
00:10:26,652 --> 00:10:27,346
Wha?

178
00:10:35,612 --> 00:10:36,306
What are they?

179
00:10:36,334 --> 00:10:39,598
They're manatees. Gretchen and Flubber
are from the Gulf of Mexico.

180
00:10:39,626 --> 00:10:42,376
Tinker, Pete and Lucy
are from the Caribbean Sea.

181
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:45,195
Family Guy is written by manatees?

182
00:10:45,577 --> 00:10:47,881
Of course, it all makes sense now.

183
00:10:47,924 --> 00:10:49,530
They really are brilliant creatures.

184
00:10:49,563 --> 00:10:52,613
You see, the right side of the tank
is filled with idea balls.

185
00:10:52,627 --> 00:10:56,301
Each ball has a verb, noun or pop
culture reference written on it.

186
00:10:56,301 --> 00:10:57,606
There's millions of them.

187
00:10:57,773 --> 00:10:59,366
The manatees choose an idea ball

188
00:10:59,366 --> 00:11:02,380
and swim it over to the joke combine
on the other side of the tank.

189
00:11:02,408 --> 00:11:04,987
Uh there goes Gretchen!
She's comin' up with an idea.

190
00:11:05,876 --> 00:11:07,714
Oh, she came up with Gary Coleman.

191
00:11:07,784 --> 00:11:12,034
The idea balls drop into the joke combine
and form part of the new script.

192
00:11:12,595 --> 00:11:16,761
Loundry Date, Winning, Mexico, Gary Coleman.

193
00:11:16,789 --> 00:11:19,775
A perfect Family Guy joke!
I can see it now!

194
00:11:20,504 --> 00:11:23,088
<i>Peter, you didn't do the laundry today.</i>

195
00:11:23,129 --> 00:11:29,040
<i>You think that's bad? Remember the time
I won a date to Mexico with Gary Coleman?</i>

196
00:11:30,012 --> 00:11:33,141
<i>¿Qué pasa, señores?
- Whatchoo talkin' 'bout, Willis?</i>

197
00:11:33,224 --> 00:11:36,821
Waitwaitaminute waitaminute.
These manatees demanded that Muhammad be shown?

198
00:11:36,821 --> 00:11:38,488
How?
Manatees don't talk!

199
00:11:38,530 --> 00:11:40,739
When FOX censored the image
of Muhammad last week,

200
00:11:40,739 --> 00:11:44,572
it also meant that the Muhammad ball
had to come out of the idea tank.

201
00:11:44,851 --> 00:11:46,798
It made the manatees very upset.

202
00:11:46,910 --> 00:11:51,277
Pull just one idea ball out of the idea tank
and the manatees stop working.

203
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,812
He-here, I'll show you.
Keith?

204
00:12:01,129 --> 00:12:02,740
All right all right, put it back in!

205
00:12:05,851 --> 00:12:07,842
Manatees are very ethical writers.

206
00:12:07,869 --> 00:12:10,717
Either everything's okay to write
about or nothing is.

207
00:12:11,036 --> 00:12:14,508
Anyway, the president of the network
wanted you to speak with the manatees.

208
00:12:14,633 --> 00:12:16,121
Oh... yes, yes.

209
00:12:17,827 --> 00:12:21,924
Hello, manatees. I think you should allow the
network to pull your episode with Muhammad.

210
00:12:22,327 --> 00:12:26,070
See, I'm the victim of a, a terrorist attack
and... terrorists might come after you if you-

211
00:12:26,070 --> 00:12:28,227
That isn't gonna work on them.
- Why not?

212
00:12:28,283 --> 00:12:30,236
Don't you know anything about manatees?

213
00:12:30,236 --> 00:12:33,834
They're the only mammals that are
completely unmoved by terrorst threats.

214
00:12:34,945 --> 00:12:36,445
Son of a bitch.

215
00:12:39,293 --> 00:12:41,752
Get me out of here, kid!
Why are you doing this?

216
00:12:41,793 --> 00:12:43,960
Well well well!

217
00:12:45,791 --> 00:12:47,167
Cartman!
- Hello, Kyle.

218
00:12:47,477 --> 00:12:50,275
Looks like you've run into
a little snag in your plan as well.

219
00:12:50,410 --> 00:12:51,761
You fat sun of a bitch!

220
00:12:52,052 --> 00:12:54,126
You came so close to stopping me,
didn't you, Kyle.

221
00:12:54,154 --> 00:12:56,074
There was just one thing you didn't count on.

222
00:12:56,185 --> 00:12:59,741
That more people besides me hate Family Guy.
- Yeah.

223
00:13:00,324 --> 00:13:02,362
Well, a lot of people like Family Guy too!

224
00:13:02,362 --> 00:13:04,140
Who are you to decide
it shouldn't be on the air?!

225
00:13:04,168 --> 00:13:06,918
Shut up!
You shut your fucking face, man!

226
00:13:07,071 --> 00:13:10,276
Did it work? Did you scare
the network into pulling the episode?

227
00:13:10,554 --> 00:13:13,179
Not yet! But I've come up with a new plan.

228
00:13:13,276 --> 00:13:16,312
I've learned how to make the
Family Guy writing staff stop working!

229
00:13:16,396 --> 00:13:19,743
As soon as everyone goes on their
lunch break, I can sneak back in.

230
00:13:19,784 --> 00:13:20,751
Cool man!

231
00:13:20,793 --> 00:13:22,960
Cartman, let me out of this stupid net!

232
00:13:23,001 --> 00:13:26,029
Good, Kyle! That's good anger
you're showin' there! See that?!

233
00:13:26,070 --> 00:13:29,665
That's emotional character development
based on what's happening in the storyline!

234
00:13:29,707 --> 00:13:34,294
Not at all like Family Guy.
Now, if you'll excuse me, Kyle.

235
00:13:34,336 --> 00:13:38,385
I've got some idea balls to
remove from a manatee tank.

236
00:13:38,791 --> 00:13:40,027
What?!

237
00:13:40,834 --> 00:13:43,653
I don't understand it.
What's wrong with them?

238
00:13:46,753 --> 00:13:49,687
We don't know, Mr. President.
They just stopped working.

239
00:13:49,729 --> 00:13:52,701
But, nobody took any idea balls
out of the tank, did they?

240
00:13:52,743 --> 00:13:54,570
No sir, none of us did.

241
00:13:55,066 --> 00:13:57,191
Then why are they refusing to write?

242
00:13:57,357 --> 00:13:59,704
I agreed to show Muhammad uncensored!

243
00:13:59,922 --> 00:14:03,589
I did what you asked!
What do you want from me?!

244
00:14:03,699 --> 00:14:05,033
Sir! Sir!

245
00:14:05,350 --> 00:14:08,040
If you don't my saying,
I think you asked for this.

246
00:14:08,452 --> 00:14:10,702
You gave in to the manatees last week.

247
00:14:10,827 --> 00:14:13,966
Now they know all they have to do is refuse
to work and they can get whatever they want.

248
00:14:14,022 --> 00:14:15,619
You spoiled them by caving in.

249
00:14:15,647 --> 00:14:17,556
Now they thnk they can walk all over you.

250
00:14:18,362 --> 00:14:20,922
Sir, you are in charge of this network, not them.

251
00:14:20,978 --> 00:14:23,697
Maybe it's time you showed them who's in charge.

252
00:14:24,794 --> 00:14:26,016
You're right.

253
00:14:26,044 --> 00:14:30,145
It's time I stop letting these
primadonna manatees tell me what to do!

254
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:32,605
I'm pulling the Muhammad episode, you got that?!

255
00:14:32,647 --> 00:14:36,299
And if you all don't want to work tomorrow,
you can just find other jobs!

256
00:14:36,341 --> 00:14:38,286
How long before Family Guy's supposed to air?!

257
00:14:38,327 --> 00:14:39,369
Twenty-five minutes.

258
00:14:39,397 --> 00:14:40,562
I gotta hurry!

259
00:14:42,201 --> 00:14:43,201
I did it.

260
00:14:43,229 --> 00:14:46,158
I... am... God!

261
00:14:46,991 --> 00:14:49,186
Family Guy is going off the air!

262
00:14:49,255 --> 00:14:51,416
No more Family Guy for me, mon frère!

263
00:14:51,605 --> 00:14:52,910
C artman!

264
00:14:54,077 --> 00:14:56,202
You fucking fatass!

265
00:14:56,424 --> 00:14:57,750
How the hell did you get out?

266
00:14:57,875 --> 00:14:59,831
That kid and I had a long talk!

267
00:14:59,884 --> 00:15:03,137
I told him he was on a slippery
slope to becoming a monster like you!

268
00:15:03,193 --> 00:15:05,984
Aw, God damnit, you gave him one
of your gay little speeches, didn't you?!

269
00:15:06,054 --> 00:15:08,595
You are not killing Family Guy!

270
00:15:08,664 --> 00:15:11,333
You're too late, Kyle! The president
of the network is pulling the episode!

271
00:15:11,458 --> 00:15:13,306
Family Guy is as good as dead!

272
00:15:13,639 --> 00:15:16,500
There's still time to tell the network
president you're full of crap!

273
00:15:17,290 --> 00:15:20,443
I can't let you do that!
- Get out of my way or I'll kick your ass!

274
00:15:20,818 --> 00:15:23,748
Fine, Kyle. I guess it was inevitable.

275
00:15:25,063 --> 00:15:27,105
Let this be our final battle.

276
00:15:33,250 --> 00:15:35,992
Stop it!
Kyle, that's too hard! Ah!

277
00:15:36,786 --> 00:15:38,036
Kyle! Stop it!

278
00:15:38,647 --> 00:15:39,953
Quit it!
- Quit it, Kyle!

279
00:15:40,647 --> 00:15:41,300
Kyle!

280
00:15:45,669 --> 00:15:46,308
Stop it!

281
00:15:46,781 --> 00:15:48,086
Quit it!
- Quit it, Kyle!

282
00:15:48,503 --> 00:15:49,808
Kyle! Let go-

283
00:15:50,058 --> 00:15:51,213
Okay okay come on, time out.

284
00:15:51,213 --> 00:15:52,560
Kyle, time out! Time out! Time out.

285
00:15:53,650 --> 00:15:54,358
Time in!

286
00:15:58,650 --> 00:15:59,469
Okay. Okay. Time out!

287
00:15:59,469 --> 00:16:00,907
Kyle time out! Time out! Time out!

288
00:16:00,907 --> 00:16:03,685
No more tmieouts, fatass!
- Time out! Time out! Time out, Kyle!

289
00:16:13,856 --> 00:16:14,620
Kyle!

290
00:16:15,981 --> 00:16:17,036
Get the- Kyle!

291
00:16:17,189 --> 00:16:19,064
Kyle, dude, that was- that was in the balls!

292
00:16:19,147 --> 00:16:21,189
Dude, serious- seriously!
That was in the balls!

293
00:16:21,238 --> 00:16:23,599
No hitting- No hitting in the balls!

294
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:26,946
Kyle!

295
00:16:36,684 --> 00:16:37,878
Quit it, Kyle.

296
00:16:38,934 --> 00:16:40,350
Give it up, Kyle!

297
00:16:46,326 --> 00:16:47,131
Okay...

298
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:50,423
Okay! Okay okay!
You win!

299
00:16:51,256 --> 00:16:53,072
You win.
I give up.

300
00:16:56,865 --> 00:16:58,879
I had my fingers crossed.

301
00:17:05,294 --> 00:17:06,273
Thanks, kid.

302
00:17:06,516 --> 00:17:09,088
Network Control!
This is the President!

303
00:17:09,102 --> 00:17:11,199
I want you to pull the episode.

304
00:17:11,747 --> 00:17:14,733
What?
Mr. President, are you sure?

305
00:17:15,108 --> 00:17:19,538
I'm sure.
Begin episode jettison sequence 0 2 900.

306
00:17:23,608 --> 00:17:25,278
<i>Voice System initiated.</i>

307
00:17:25,358 --> 00:17:26,483
Awaiting confirmation.

308
00:17:26,815 --> 00:17:29,366
Mr. President, we need your final approval code.

309
00:17:29,399 --> 00:17:32,363
President approval code 0-0-destruct-

310
00:17:32,363 --> 00:17:35,085
Sir! Mister television executive!
Stop!

311
00:17:35,201 --> 00:17:35,881
Who are you?

312
00:17:35,904 --> 00:17:39,719
Listen to me, the little boy who convinced
you to pull the episode is a bastard child.

313
00:17:39,747 --> 00:17:43,303
He only wants you to pull it because he knows
it will be the end of Family Guy forever!

314
00:17:43,330 --> 00:17:44,511
The end of Family Guy?

315
00:17:44,511 --> 00:17:46,933
Mr. President, we need final authorization!

316
00:17:46,961 --> 00:17:49,128
Hold on, Julie!
What are you talking about, kid?

317
00:17:49,141 --> 00:17:52,015
Pulling an episode because someone
is offended starts a chain reaction.

318
00:17:52,015 --> 00:17:55,224
You'll have to pull more and more episodes
until the show goes off the air completely.

319
00:17:55,224 --> 00:17:57,105
It's what happened to Laverne & Shirley.

320
00:17:57,126 --> 00:18:00,939
You mean...
the manatees aren't trying to run the network?

321
00:18:01,171 --> 00:18:02,633
What manatees?!

322
00:18:03,647 --> 00:18:05,647
Go ahead, Mr. President!
Continue what you were doing!

323
00:18:05,703 --> 00:18:08,120
No!
You have to show Muhammad, Mr. President!

324
00:18:08,154 --> 00:18:10,321
Mr. President, we're awaiting your orders!

325
00:18:10,349 --> 00:18:12,904
Sir, just think about what
you're doing to free speech!

326
00:18:12,959 --> 00:18:15,308
No!
Think about the people who could get hurt!

327
00:18:15,711 --> 00:18:17,393
I don't know who to listen to!

328
00:18:17,421 --> 00:18:19,155
Okay, I'll make it easy for you

329
00:18:19,711 --> 00:18:21,728
Pull the Muhammad episode, now!

330
00:18:21,798 --> 00:18:23,062
Okay, I'll listen to you.

331
00:18:23,089 --> 00:18:24,901
Julie?
- No! Wait!

332
00:18:24,915 --> 00:18:28,860
You can't listen to him! He's a lying deceitful
monster who only wants Family Guy off the air!

333
00:18:28,930 --> 00:18:30,110
But he has a gun.

334
00:18:30,138 --> 00:18:34,242
You can't do what he wants just because
he's the one threatening you with violence!

335
00:18:34,395 --> 00:18:35,311
Shut up, Kyle!

336
00:18:35,353 --> 00:18:38,811
I can't be responsible for people getting hurt.
Especially me.

337
00:18:38,894 --> 00:18:42,005
Yes, people can get hurt.
That's how terrorism works.

338
00:18:42,033 --> 00:18:45,449
But if you give into that, Doug,
you're allowing terrorism to work.

339
00:18:45,657 --> 00:18:46,945
Do the right thing here.

340
00:18:47,015 --> 00:18:49,084
Give the orders to pull
the episode, Mr. President!

341
00:18:49,209 --> 00:18:53,225
I shouldn't even be in the office still.
It's supposed to be half-day Friday.

342
00:18:53,628 --> 00:18:56,922
Mr. President, thirty seconds to airtime.
What do you want us to do?!

343
00:18:57,227 --> 00:18:58,783
Do the right thing, Mr. President.

344
00:18:58,852 --> 00:19:02,419
How about I allow the episode to air but,
just censor out the image of Muhammad again.

345
00:19:02,503 --> 00:19:03,891
I wish that was good enough.

346
00:19:03,989 --> 00:19:07,419
But if you censor out Muhammad,
then soon you'll have to censor out more.

347
00:19:07,516 --> 00:19:08,840
No gay speeches, Kyle!

348
00:19:09,007 --> 00:19:10,502
If you don't show Muhammad,

349
00:19:10,516 --> 00:19:14,291
then you've made a distinction what
is okay to poke fun at and what isn't.

350
00:19:14,375 --> 00:19:16,847
Either it's all okay, or none of it is.

351
00:19:16,890 --> 00:19:18,641
Five seconds, Mr. Preside

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
