1
00:00:08,092 --> 00:00:11,370
<i>I'm going out to South Park
gonna have myself a time</i>

2
00:00:11,428 --> 00:00:14,722
<i>Friendly faces everywhere
humble folks without temptation</i>

3
00:00:14,765 --> 00:00:18,059
<i>I'm goin out to south park
gonna leave my woes behind</i>

4
00:00:18,102 --> 00:00:21,396
<i>Ample parking day or night
people spouting howdy neighbor</i>

5
00:00:21,438 --> 00:00:24,540
<i>I'm heading out to south park
to see if i cant unwind</i>

6
00:00:24,566 --> 00:00:27,860
<i>I like girls with big fat titties
really big fat titties</i>

7
00:00:27,903 --> 00:00:31,042
<i>So come on out to south park
and meet some friends of mine</i>

8
00:00:31,043 --> 00:00:32,301
<i>Episode 10x11
"Hell On Earth 2006"</i>

9
00:00:38,495 --> 00:00:45,546
Halloween is a night for evil.
It is time for me to take what is mine.

10
00:00:45,896 --> 00:00:47,860
What do you plan, Lord Satan?

11
00:00:47,953 --> 00:00:53,813
On Halloween we shall open
the Gates of Hell, rise up to the earth

12
00:00:53,817 --> 00:00:57,485
and we will rent out the entire W Hotel

13
00:00:57,488 --> 00:01:02,033
for an awesome party
and invite a bunch of celebrities!

14
00:01:02,628 --> 00:01:04,642
How big a party are we talking?

15
00:01:04,737 --> 00:01:10,113
Have you seen those rich, spoiled, teenage
girls who have massive Sweet 16 parties?

16
00:01:10,286 --> 00:01:12,230
That big.

17
00:01:12,506 --> 00:01:15,552
Satan, we can't possibly do-
- Silence!

18
00:01:15,666 --> 00:01:19,990
Halloween is about me!
And I deserve a par-ty!

19
00:01:20,265 --> 00:01:25,332
This shall be my Super Sweet 16!

20
00:01:32,908 --> 00:01:34,620
Minions of Hell!

21
00:01:34,716 --> 00:01:43,390
The time has come for us to rise!
For my Super Sweet 16 Halloween party!

22
00:01:43,446 --> 00:01:47,892
I got Bacardi and Ghetto One
to sponsor the alcohol

23
00:01:47,897 --> 00:01:52,930
and I'm calling it "Hell On Earth 2006"!

24
00:01:54,707 --> 00:01:59,600
But now, heed my words:
in order to get in to the party

25
00:01:59,615 --> 00:02:03,540
you have to RSVP and get a blue wristband.

26
00:02:03,755 --> 00:02:06,121
Everyone is gonna try
and get into this party

27
00:02:06,128 --> 00:02:08,471
so if you don't get your wristband in advance

28
00:02:08,475 --> 00:02:12,942
you're not wearing that wristband
at the door, you're not getting in!

29
00:02:14,596 --> 00:02:20,161
And now know this: It's a costume party,
so you have to wear a costume.

30
00:02:20,245 --> 00:02:26,313
But... nobody better show up as The Crow!
I'm serious.

31
00:02:26,346 --> 00:02:30,182
Every costume party there's like
fourteen guys come dressed like the Crow

32
00:02:30,187 --> 00:02:32,370
'cause they wanna look hot and hook up.

33
00:02:32,377 --> 00:02:33,690
It's lame!

34
00:02:33,757 --> 00:02:39,541
If you come dressed as the Crow,
you're not getting in to the party!

35
00:02:40,985 --> 00:02:47,901
Go now and prepare!
If you miss my party you are a looozer!

36
00:02:52,215 --> 00:02:54,920
Oh boy, a Halloween party up on Earth.

37
00:02:54,978 --> 00:02:57,950
I can't believe he got the entire W Hotel.

38
00:02:58,018 --> 00:03:00,992
This is going to be the best Halloween evah.

39
00:03:08,006 --> 00:03:10,412
Go ahead, Kyle, do it.
- I am doing it.

40
00:03:10,417 --> 00:03:12,852
No! Don't do it!
- What's the big deal, Kyle?

41
00:03:12,928 --> 00:03:16,540
You just look in the mirror
and say the name three times.

42
00:03:17,465 --> 00:03:19,860
Biggie Smalls...

43
00:03:20,447 --> 00:03:22,660
Biggie Smalls...

44
00:03:22,938 --> 00:03:23,900
See? You're scared.

45
00:03:23,905 --> 00:03:28,203
Because you know if you say it a third time,
he's gonna show up and shoot you in the face.

46
00:03:28,287 --> 00:03:30,063
Fine!
Then you do it, you're so tough!

47
00:03:30,125 --> 00:03:32,703
I've done it lots of times.
- Prove it!

48
00:03:36,758 --> 00:03:38,732
Biggie Smalls...

49
00:03:39,688 --> 00:03:41,982
Biggie Smalls...

50
00:03:43,395 --> 00:03:45,013
This is dumb, you guys,
let's do somethin' else.

51
00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:46,942
You're afraid to do it, too.
- I am not!

52
00:03:46,998 --> 00:03:49,462
Then do it, if you're not yellow!

53
00:03:52,258 --> 00:03:54,420
Biggie Smalls...

54
00:03:54,925 --> 00:03:57,193
Biggie Smalls...

55
00:03:57,468 --> 00:03:59,580
Biggie...
- Hey fellas.

56
00:04:01,465 --> 00:04:04,683
You should come downstairs.
Stan's mom made pa-pizza.

57
00:04:04,737 --> 00:04:07,163
Let's go.
Yeah, let's go!

58
00:04:07,405 --> 00:04:10,373
Oh my God. I crapped my pants.

59
00:04:10,737 --> 00:04:12,663
You guys, I crapped my pants!

60
00:04:13,135 --> 00:04:14,701
You guys! You guys, check it out!

61
00:04:18,956 --> 00:04:23,913
Satan, I must speak with thee.
- What is it?

62
00:04:23,978 --> 00:04:27,273
You've invited so many celebrities
on Earth to your party

63
00:04:27,278 --> 00:04:30,902
that people in Hell can't get wristbands.

64
00:04:30,958 --> 00:04:34,320
Well I have to invite celebrities
or else my party won't be cool.

65
00:04:34,447 --> 00:04:41,990
Satan, I warn thee, do not thorw this party
at the cost of alienating your friends.

66
00:04:42,147 --> 00:04:45,523
I'm not alienating my friends!
I know they come first!

67
00:04:45,588 --> 00:04:47,833
I hope for your sake that's true.

68
00:04:47,896 --> 00:04:51,592
You've never thrown a party of
this magnitude before, Satan.

69
00:04:51,755 --> 00:04:53,323
Be wary.

70
00:04:59,355 --> 00:05:03,081
Halloween has always been
a time of evil and darkness.

71
00:05:03,196 --> 00:05:06,601
But now it appears that Satan
will literally be among us.

72
00:05:06,726 --> 00:05:10,950
He is bringing Hell here to Los Angeles
and from what we understand.

73
00:05:11,076 --> 00:05:15,603
The gathering is going to be...
completely off the hook.

74
00:05:18,078 --> 00:05:23,320
There's more:
None of us... are invited.

75
00:05:25,266 --> 00:05:27,480
None?
- Satan mocks us.

76
00:05:27,555 --> 00:05:29,453
His party must be stopped.

77
00:05:29,515 --> 00:05:33,303
Yes,  we cannot let evil take
over our city, even for a night.

78
00:05:33,478 --> 00:05:35,390
What can we do?

79
00:05:35,436 --> 00:05:40,023
Tomorrow night, after all
of Satan's guests have arrived

80
00:05:40,108 --> 00:05:43,030
we'll call in a complaint about
how many people are there.

81
00:05:43,848 --> 00:05:49,473
We'll see how long Satan's party lasts...
after the fire marshal shows up.

82
00:05:52,825 --> 00:05:56,610
<i>That's why I like to brush my teeth.
I know they're clean and white.</i>

83
00:05:56,677 --> 00:06:01,822
All the-
I truly love to brush my teeth.

84
00:06:07,336 --> 00:06:09,913
Biggie Smalls...

85
00:06:10,265 --> 00:06:12,841
Biggie Smalls...

86
00:06:13,776 --> 00:06:15,813
Biggie Smalls...

87
00:06:16,648 --> 00:06:19,233
What the fuck is this?!

88
00:06:27,228 --> 00:06:29,600
Butters! We told you to be in bed!
What are you doing?!

89
00:06:29,635 --> 00:06:32,853
I summoned Biggie Smalls, the hip-hop rapper!

90
00:06:33,166 --> 00:06:36,471
You had a nightmare! Turn around
and get back in your room right now!

91
00:06:36,526 --> 00:06:39,190
But Dad, his gonna bust a cap in my ass!

92
00:06:39,316 --> 00:06:43,262
Well, you wanna get shot
or you wanna be grounded?!

93
00:06:44,256 --> 00:06:48,072
Honestly, why do let him watch
that darn Black Entertainment Channel?

94
00:06:51,106 --> 00:06:53,352
So I want the DJ to set up over here

95
00:06:53,358 --> 00:06:56,560
and then the main dance floor area
can be this whole area right here.

96
00:06:56,656 --> 00:06:59,812
What about valets?
How will people be arriving from Hell?

97
00:06:59,878 --> 00:07:03,540
Oh, it's like a dimensional vortex gate thingy,
they they won't have cars.

98
00:07:03,617 --> 00:07:06,912
But we're probably gonna want security
at the dimensional vortex gate.

99
00:07:06,976 --> 00:07:10,670
I want all the servers dressed in skimpy
outfits serving all the hors d'oeuvres.

100
00:07:10,738 --> 00:07:14,672
This is getting really expensive.
- Shut up, it's Halloween!

101
00:07:14,736 --> 00:07:16,392
This is my night!

102
00:07:16,577 --> 00:07:19,523
Then at midnight, for dessert,
I'm thinking over here

103
00:07:19,525 --> 00:07:22,692
we bring out a huuuge
chocolate fondue fountain.

104
00:07:22,755 --> 00:07:26,753
Oh yeah, P. Diddy had his birthday party here
a couple years back and he had one of those.

105
00:07:26,827 --> 00:07:30,281
Oh, screw that, then. I don't want
a fondue fountain if P. Diddy had one.

106
00:07:30,328 --> 00:07:32,640
Does it matter?!
- Yes it matters!

107
00:07:32,677 --> 00:07:34,322
I don't wanna do it if Diddy did it!

108
00:07:34,378 --> 00:07:36,840
How about a doughnut machine?
- Did Diddy do it?

109
00:07:36,917 --> 00:07:37,801
Diddy did do it.

110
00:07:37,835 --> 00:07:39,921
A full ice cream bar!
- Diddy did it.

111
00:07:39,956 --> 00:07:42,213
Damnit, what didn't Diddy do?!

112
00:07:42,726 --> 00:07:45,460
Wait. I know.

113
00:07:45,766 --> 00:07:51,030
Yes. It's perfect.
At midnight, all the lights go down.

114
00:07:51,165 --> 00:07:57,303
The music stops.
And then we wheel in... a Ferrari.

115
00:07:57,475 --> 00:08:04,753
Only it isn't a Ferrari... It's a cake.
And everyone gets a piece.

116
00:08:05,246 --> 00:08:08,172
A Ferrari cake?
- Diddy didn't do it.

117
00:08:08,226 --> 00:08:12,291
Satan, really, the logistics of getting
a cake the size of a Ferrari made in time-

118
00:08:12,298 --> 00:08:15,690
This party has to be the bomb
Don't you get it?!

119
00:08:16,487 --> 00:08:22,911
When everyone sees the Ferrari cake,
they will shudder and know my greatness!

120
00:08:24,756 --> 00:08:30,762
Hear me, demons!
Lord Satan has demanded a Ferrari cake!

121
00:08:30,925 --> 00:08:37,973
Now I will take charge of Halloween and call
upon the spirits of Hell's most evil souls!

122
00:08:38,238 --> 00:08:40,793
Ted Bundy!

123
00:08:41,998 --> 00:08:44,551
Jeffrey Dahmer!

124
00:08:45,047 --> 00:08:47,613
And John Wayne Gacy!

125
00:08:48,406 --> 00:08:56,221
You  shall rise once again to walk the earth,
for tomorrow is Halloween, and I need you...

126
00:08:56,348 --> 00:09:01,492
to pick up Satan's Ferrari cake
and deliver it to the W Hotel!

127
00:09:01,586 --> 00:09:03,990
No problem.
- We can handle it.

128
00:09:04,117 --> 00:09:10,132
Heed my words: Satan's entire
Halloween depends on this Ferrari cake.

129
00:09:10,265 --> 00:09:15,571
Fail, and you will know his greatest wrath!

130
00:09:23,067 --> 00:09:25,271
You punkass fool!

131
00:09:25,598 --> 00:09:28,540
Why'd you summon me?
- P-please don't ice me, homie.

132
00:09:28,586 --> 00:09:33,442
You'd better have a good reason, sucka!
- I just... w-was seein' if it works.

133
00:09:33,768 --> 00:09:37,040
Damn!  Every Halloween
I gots tuh deal with this shit!

134
00:09:37,096 --> 00:09:40,422
I'm in hell, mindin' my own business
and the next thing I know

135
00:09:40,426 --> 00:09:42,402
I'm in some kid's bathroom.

136
00:09:42,508 --> 00:09:44,700
I apologize, Mr. Smalls.

137
00:09:44,766 --> 00:09:47,510
You don't understand, fool!
I ain't missin' the party!

138
00:09:47,596 --> 00:09:50,523
W-what party?
- I already got my wristband, see?

139
00:09:50,565 --> 00:09:52,631
You've got to get me to Los Angeles!

140
00:09:52,675 --> 00:09:54,513
Well can't you just take a plane?

141
00:09:54,596 --> 00:09:57,000
How, punk?!
We don't use money in her, nigga!

142
00:09:57,086 --> 00:09:59,172
Well damn, nigga, there's gotta be some way!

143
00:09:59,247 --> 00:10:00,780
This is your fault, homie!

144
00:10:00,783 --> 00:10:04,373
You've gots to get me to that party in L.A.
or i'm gonna smoke your ass!

145
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:06,385
Oh hamburgehers!

146
00:10:09,938 --> 00:10:14,573
Yes. Yes, Satan.
Your Halloween costume turned out perfect.

147
00:10:14,967 --> 00:10:20,633
Yeah, it's okay, but everyone thinks
Zazul's schoolgirl costume is hotter.

148
00:10:22,405 --> 00:10:24,241
Zazul, switch costumes with me.

149
00:10:24,316 --> 00:10:27,070
Satan, Zazul worked really hard on his costume.

150
00:10:27,136 --> 00:10:31,320
Nobody can look hotter than me!
It's my Super Sweet 16 Halloween party!

151
00:10:31,355 --> 00:10:33,641
Take it off, Zazul.

152
00:10:34,496 --> 00:10:37,423
And what about my Ferrari cake?!
Where's the Ferrari cake?!

153
00:10:37,536 --> 00:10:41,552
Relax, it's being picked up from the bakery.

154
00:10:56,168 --> 00:10:57,322
All right, this is the place.

155
00:10:57,328 --> 00:10:58,792
Now remember, you numbskulls

156
00:10:58,795 --> 00:11:02,753
this Ferrari cake is really important
for Satan's party, so don't louse it up!

157
00:11:02,825 --> 00:11:06,211
Who's lousing?
- Come here. Shut up!

158
00:11:08,156 --> 00:11:10,861
Can I help you?
- We're here to pick up the Ferrari cake.

159
00:11:10,946 --> 00:11:14,162
Oh yes, it's just about finished.
What kind of truck are we loading it up to?

160
00:11:14,218 --> 00:11:15,390
We got that flatbed.

161
00:11:15,446 --> 00:11:18,193
Okay well, we're just gonna need to-

162
00:11:19,525 --> 00:11:21,671
Gacy, you numbskull, what'd ya kill him for?!

163
00:11:21,737 --> 00:11:24,130
I didn't mean tuh.
- Give me that!

164
00:11:24,195 --> 00:11:25,961
What's the matter with you?!
Take this!

165
00:11:25,998 --> 00:11:28,623
Everything all right?

166
00:11:28,768 --> 00:11:30,762
You nincompoop!
That was the baker!

167
00:11:30,798 --> 00:11:32,001
He startled me.

168
00:11:32,056 --> 00:11:33,701
Gacy!

169
00:11:35,036 --> 00:11:37,253
What'dja kill him for?!
Sit down!

170
00:11:37,375 --> 00:11:40,393
I'm a victim of circumstance.
- Ahh, who're you hittin'?

171
00:11:42,197 --> 00:11:43,480
Get outta here. Be quiet.

172
00:11:44,657 --> 00:11:48,983
You idiots! Now who's gonna help us
load the Ferrari cake onto the flatbed?!

173
00:11:51,468 --> 00:11:54,691
Did your son say anything
before he disappeared, Mrs. Stotch?

174
00:11:54,757 --> 00:11:58,402
He just said something about...
summoning Biggie Smalls.

175
00:11:59,958 --> 00:12:00,940
Dude.

176
00:12:01,035 --> 00:12:03,861
Du... du... dude.

177
00:12:05,517 --> 00:12:07,202
Dad! Dad!
- What?

178
00:12:07,258 --> 00:12:09,330
If you look in the mirror
and say Biggie Smalls' name three times

179
00:12:09,336 --> 00:12:11,262
he doesn't come and get you, right?

180
00:12:12,547 --> 00:12:13,633
Biggie Smalls?

181
00:12:13,675 --> 00:12:18,291
You know, escargot, my cargo, one eighteen,
sippin' on booze at the House of Blues.

182
00:12:18,357 --> 00:12:22,202
All right, boys, I know it's Halloween,
but you can't summon dead rappers in the mirror.

183
00:12:22,265 --> 00:12:25,313
How do you know?
- I'm a geologist!

184
00:12:25,948 --> 00:12:28,501
He's right. It's just a spook story.

185
00:12:28,615 --> 00:12:30,202
Then how come you couldn't do it?

186
00:12:30,266 --> 00:12:34,183
I can do it. It just got... look,
it just doesn't matter, because it's not true.

187
00:12:34,255 --> 00:12:37,533
How can we be sure? How do we know
Butters isn't with Biggie right now?

188
00:12:37,648 --> 00:12:39,402
Being tormented by him?

189
00:12:41,835 --> 00:12:45,473
<i>I'm going going, back back, to Cali Cali.</i>

190
00:12:46,005 --> 00:12:49,720
<i>Yeah, I'm going going,
back back, to Cali Cali.</i>

191
00:12:49,825 --> 00:12:51,520
Yo dawg, keep it down.

192
00:12:51,565 --> 00:12:55,593
Yo dawg, uh, can't I just go back home right
after the flight so I don't get grounded?

193
00:12:55,655 --> 00:12:59,861
Oh no! You summoned my spirit,
you're gettin' me all the way to the party!

194
00:12:59,907 --> 00:13:04,283
As long as I get to the party in time
to party, everything'll be all right.

195
00:13:04,878 --> 00:13:07,320
Hey!
- ...Smalls.

196
00:13:07,456 --> 00:13:09,550
Oh, God-damnit!

197
00:13:10,376 --> 00:13:12,432
It does work!
- Holly crap!

198
00:13:12,518 --> 00:13:15,250
That's it!
Now I'm pissed!

199
00:13:33,886 --> 00:13:36,103
Hehey, everybody.
Check out Hitler.

200
00:13:36,146 --> 00:13:38,792
He's the "Can you hear me now?" guy.

201
00:13:40,136 --> 00:13:43,912
Can you hear me now?
Can you hear me now?

202
00:13:44,608 --> 00:13:46,093
Everyone quiet!

203
00:13:46,135 --> 00:13:50,653
Here he is, the man of the night, Satan!

204
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:58,102
Get out of the way, Hitler!
You're ruining my entrance!

205
00:13:59,128 --> 00:14:01,800
Yes, hello?
It this the fire department?

206
00:14:04,395 --> 00:14:07,923
I need to make a complaint to the fire marshal.

207
00:14:09,536 --> 00:14:12,182
He's what? Where?

208
00:14:12,865 --> 00:14:14,801
Damn your evil heart, Satan!

209
00:14:14,887 --> 00:14:17,753
What?
- Fire marshal is at the party!

210
00:14:17,838 --> 00:14:21,832
Satan invited him!
Satan's trickery knows no bounds!

211
00:14:21,896 --> 00:14:26,373
That's it! One way or another,
we're crashing this party!

212
00:14:28,787 --> 00:14:33,682
This is VIP. Don't just let
anybody into my VIP area, okay?

213
00:14:34,287 --> 00:14:36,971
Hey, Satan, you got a little problem.
- What?

214
00:14:37,026 --> 00:14:39,672
Somebody showed up in
a Crocodile Hunter costume.

215
00:14:39,735 --> 00:14:41,803
It's really offending some of the other guests.

216
00:14:41,847 --> 00:14:43,843
Oh jeez.

217
00:14:47,676 --> 00:14:52,173
Hey,  uh, hi, listen, dude, ya know,
the whole Crocodile Hunter thing?

218
00:14:52,236 --> 00:14:54,021
It... it's just a little soon, you know?

219
00:14:54,026 --> 00:14:59,221
I mean, he just dies a few weeks ago
and it's just not supercool and you gotta leave.

220
00:14:59,285 --> 00:15:04,453
But it's me, Satan. Steve Irwin.
I am the Crocodile Hunter.

221
00:15:05,797 --> 00:15:09,030
Oh, but then, dude, no costume.
Sorry, you gotta go.

222
00:15:09,088 --> 00:15:11,430
Wait! I thought we were friends!

223
00:15:12,506 --> 00:15:14,950
Oh hey, Sinatra!

224
00:15:15,576 --> 00:15:18,401
Demonius!
Demonius, we have a problem!

225
00:15:18,777 --> 00:15:21,803
What is it?
- The Ferrari cake! It isn't here!

226
00:15:21,806 --> 00:15:24,003
What? Don't even tell me that!

227
00:15:24,046 --> 00:15:26,153
It was never delivered to the hotel.

228
00:15:26,308 --> 00:15:32,463
Sevo! Fetch my Blackberry!
That Ferrari cake must get here by midnight!

229
00:15:33,975 --> 00:15:36,601
<i>The Three Murderers</i>

230
00:15:46,377 --> 00:15:48,631
Do you gentlemen need a hand?

231
00:15:51,877 --> 00:15:53,333
Gacy!

232
00:15:54,536 --> 00:15:56,071
Whatcha do that foor?!

233
00:15:56,136 --> 00:15:58,591
I did it for Dahmer.
- For Dahmer?

234
00:15:58,697 --> 00:16:02,373
Yeah. He likes havin' sex with dead bodies.

235
00:16:02,936 --> 00:16:05,612
Dahmer! Stop havin' sex with them intestines!

236
00:16:05,668 --> 00:16:08,630
What good are intestines
if you can't have sex with them?

237
00:16:08,736 --> 00:16:12,001
We gotta get rid of this body
before anyone sees it!

238
00:16:15,406 --> 00:16:17,221
Now get those to the trashcan!

239
00:16:17,267 --> 00:16:19,301
Stop eating that!

240
00:16:19,767 --> 00:16:21,690
Leave him alone!

241
00:16:21,898 --> 00:16:23,712
Cut it!
Come here ya.

242
00:16:26,755 --> 00:16:27,852
There.

243
00:16:30,036 --> 00:16:32,050
The cake!

244
00:16:37,266 --> 00:16:39,121
Oh, no!

245
00:16:39,327 --> 00:16:41,063
Mmm, Ferrari.

246
00:16:41,736 --> 00:16:43,903
What's the matter with you?!
It's ruined!

247
00:16:43,965 --> 00:16:46,611
We're gonna get it now.

248
00:16:51,607 --> 00:16:54,563
This is a really extravagant party, Satan.

249
00:16:54,615 --> 00:16:57,233
I know, but just wait till midnight.

250
00:16:57,298 --> 00:17:01,370
You are not gonna believe
what's coming for desert!

251
00:17:04,365 --> 00:17:07,650
These aren't the right wristbands.
- Yes, they are.

252
00:17:07,718 --> 00:17:10,372
Then how come they say "Knott's Berry Farm"?

253
00:17:10,485 --> 00:17:12,863
In the name of Christ, just let us in!

254
00:17:15,848 --> 00:17:17,460
We're really sorry, Mr. Smalls.

255
00:17:17,536 --> 00:17:20,930
Not as sorry as you're gonna be,
if I completely miss the party!

256
00:17:21,017 --> 00:17:24,183
Here you go, flight 72 to Los Angeles
boarding in 10 minutes.

257
00:17:24,216 --> 00:17:26,600
See? You can still make it
for the end of the party.

258
00:17:26,677 --> 00:17:28,270
Yeah, I'm just gonna be pissed if I miss-

259
00:17:28,275 --> 00:17:31,170
What the? No! No!

260
00:17:31,308 --> 00:17:32,850
...Smalls.

261
00:17:32,946 --> 00:17:34,383
No way!

262
00:17:34,427 --> 00:17:36,850
Motherfuckiing God-damnit!

263
00:17:36,908 --> 00:17:39,212
That's pretty cool.
Hey, Hey Sharon!

264
00:17:39,288 --> 00:17:41,941
Cool this, sucka!

265
00:17:43,485 --> 00:17:47,383
<i>The Three Murderers</i>

266
00:17:47,886 --> 00:17:51,003
All right, listen you mugs!
It's now 11:30.

267
00:17:51,065 --> 00:17:54,111
That means we only have twenty minutes
to bake a new Ferrari cake.

268
00:17:54,198 --> 00:17:57,552
No problem! It just so happens that
I went to an Italian cooking school.

269
00:17:57,627 --> 00:18:01,041
Yeah? Why'd you quit?
- There weren't enough Italians to eat.

270
00:18:03,905 --> 00:18:05,463
Get over here!

271
00:18:05,666 --> 00:18:09,243
All right, what's the recipe call for first?
- Ten thousand eggs.

272
00:18:09,306 --> 00:18:12,042
Gacy, go get ten thousand eggs.
- You get 'em!

273
00:18:12,376 --> 00:18:14,110
Shut up!

274
00:18:14,595 --> 00:18:16,720
Oh! Oh, wise guy, ey?

275
00:18:18,337 --> 00:18:21,092
How's  that?
- Hey! Leave him alone!

276
00:18:22,985 --> 00:18:24,941
Try that again!

277
00:18:27,185 --> 00:18:29,173
What happened?
- Shut up!

278
00:18:36,186 --> 00:18:39,603
He can't do it, he can't do it.
- All right, be quiet.

279
00:18:40,115 --> 00:18:41,880
Biggie Smalls.

280
00:18:42,016 --> 00:18:44,532
Biggie Smalls.

281
00:18:44,676 --> 00:18:47,290
Oh I can't do it!
I'm too freaked out.

282
00:18:48,665 --> 00:18:52,382
What do we do? It's midnight.
The Ferrari cake never arrived!

283
00:18:52,476 --> 00:18:54,240
This is terrible!

284
00:18:54,316 --> 00:18:58,180
It's okay! It's okay!
I found a backup!

285
00:18:58,247 --> 00:19:01,411
Go ahead and start the ceremony!

286
00:19:03,865 --> 00:19:05,923
Your attention please.

287
00:19:06,007 --> 00:19:11,691
It is now midnight!
Time for Satan's special surprise.

288
00:19:12,945 --> 00:19:15,073
I wonder what this is going to be.

289
00:19:15,398 --> 00:19:17,693
Just you wait.

290
00:19:22,678 --> 00:19:25,821
Yes . Here it comes.

291
00:19:26,617 --> 00:19:31,913
Ladies and gentlemen:
a fully edible Acura cake!

292
00:19:33,996 --> 00:19:35,711
Acura?

293
00:19:37,396 --> 00:19:39,641
But I wanted a Ferrari!

294
00:19:39,677 --> 00:19:41,893
We did the best we could,
there was a problem.

295
00:19:41,955 --> 00:19:43,983
Acuras are really nice.

296
00:19:44,055 --> 00:19:48,870
It's not the car I wanted!
The whole party is ruined!

297
00:19:48,926 --> 00:19:52,152
It doesn't matter. Your guests
are having fun. They don't care.

298
00:19:52,197 --> 00:19:57,291
It's not about them, it's all about meee!

299
00:20:02,327 --> 00:20:04,961
Wow, what a jerk.

300
00:20:05,086 --> 00:20:10,793
Come on, Helen. Let's just go back to hell.
I'm suddenly not so hungry for Acura cake.

301
00:20:11,296 --> 00:20:14,993
Oh God, what's happened to me.

302
00:20:15,647 --> 00:20:18,303
I've never been this terrible before.

303
00:20:18,436 --> 00:20:23,682
By trying to have a party like those
spoiled rich teenage girls on MTV.

304
00:20:23,997 --> 00:20:25,941
I've become like one of them.

305
00:20:26,035 --> 00:20:29,072
Satan, don't be so hard on yourself.
You're not as bad as they are.

306
00:20:29,168 --> 00:20:30,420
But I am.

307
00:20:30,636 --> 00:20:35,360
Throwing people out, making a big entrance,
having these stupid pictures of me all over.

308
00:20:35,406 --> 00:20:37,952
Halloween is supposed to be for everyone.

309
00:20:38,107 --> 00:20:41,572
Everybody, I'm sorry.
This party is for you.

310
00:20:41,736 --> 00:20:45,200
It's for all of you who make my life so special.

311
00:20:45,328 --> 00:20:51,800
If I don't realize that, then I'm no better
than a rich American teenage girl.

312
00:20:55,405 --> 00:20:59,882
Open the doors! Let everyone in,
wristband or no!

313
00:21:07,298 --> 00:21:10,500
Excuse me.
uh ma'am, can I borrow that?

314
00:21:12,146 --> 00:21:14,121
Biggie Smalls, Biggie Smalls, Biggie Smalls.

315
00:21:14,176 --> 00:21:15,932
What the-
- Thanks.

316
00:21:15,995 --> 00:21:19,983
I am soo sick of this!
Wait, I'm at the party.

317
00:21:20,066 --> 00:21:22,031
Sure, homie.
I got your back, yo.

318
00:21:22,065 --> 00:21:25,030
And it's not too late.
Hey, why don't you come in with me?

319
00:21:25,078 --> 00:21:28,470
Wull what the heck?
I'm gonna get grounded anyway, might as well.

320
00:21:40,888 --> 00:21:43,882
