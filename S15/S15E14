to fight me, you little shit?

12
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:33,200
yeah cuz you're a
drunk piece a shit dad!

13
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:35,260
you're both drunk pieces of shit!

14
00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:38,320
Both a you sit the down!

15
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:39,930
they're noisy!

16
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:42,320
- Fuck you, bitch!
- you son of a bitch!

17
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:43,850
they're nasty!

18
00:00:43,850 --> 00:00:46,700
you done spilt that
awn mah titties, skayynk!

19
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:48,400
they're white trash!

20
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:51,100
And when you give 'em a
little pabst blue ribbon, 

21
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:53,740
they can't help getting arrested!

22
00:00:53,740 --> 00:00:58,100
Tonight, on an all new
- white trash in trouble!

23
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:00,170
pabst blue ribbon and white trash

24
00:01:00,170 --> 00:01:02,920
it's a deadly combination
that can lead to prison time

25
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:05,310
and children being taken
away from their homes.

26
00:01:05,310 --> 00:01:08,600
this white trash home in
colorado seems innocent enough

27
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:13,510
but the children in this home
live in a world of neglect.

28
00:01:13,510 --> 00:01:15,310
There's no heating, no groceries.

29
00:01:15,310 --> 00:01:17,240
And if you look closely in the backyard, 

30
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:20,590
you can even make out what
appears to be a meth lab.

31
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:31,880
down on the ground! Move!
Let's move! Get down now!

32
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:37,300
<i>{6}I'm ********</i>

33
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:37,140
no, my babies! Don't take my babies!

34
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:40,220
- you're hurting my arm!
- my babies.

35
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:41,920
you're hurting me!

36
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:44,000
you have the right to remain silent.

37
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,950
Now please look at the camera and say
'I'm white trash, and I'm in trouble.

38
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:49,970
' I'm white trash, and I'm in trouble.

39
00:01:49,970 --> 00:01:51,670
alright, good, now in the car.

40
00:01:51,670 --> 00:01:55,200
oh, wow, poor people being
arrested. What a rare occurrence.

41
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:57,900
Hey kenny! Kenny wave!

42
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:01,160
That's kenny about to be sent
to a foster home. Pretty funny.

43
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:02,780
just have a seat in there, kids.

44
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:05,740
just have a seat in nerrr. Kids.

45
00:02:06,150 --> 00:02:08,240
<i>******</i>

46
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:11,200
the mother and father will probably
be released from jail on monday, 

47
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:13,720
but I guess the kids are
gonna be taken away for good.

48
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:17,280
Child protective services is about
to talk to them in the soft room.

49
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,400
the soft room?

50
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:22,060
you know the room we have set
aside for kids to feel safe in.

51
00:02:26,810 --> 00:02:29,440
hi kids, how're you
doin'?My name's Mr.Adams, 

52
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:32,790
and I just need to get some
info from you. That sound okay?

53
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:36,190
c-can I see
my m-mommy?

54
00:02:36,530 --> 00:02:38,250
no, sorry.

55
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:40,100
Now, I've been looking over your file

56
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:45,580
and I see you kids have all been horribly
physically and emotionally abused.

57
00:02:46,610 --> 00:02:50,730
Oh, whoops! That's isn't your case file, 
it's the Penn state university gazette!

58
00:02:46,610 --> 00:02:50,731
{7}***

59
00:02:50,730 --> 00:02:53,320
I'm joking ¨C that's just a
joke. We like to have fun here.

60
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:58,090
It is your case file, I was just all like 'it's the
Penn state gazette! ' to be like a joke. We have fun.

61
00:02:58,090 --> 00:03:00,440
Now listen, you're gonna
be put into a foster home, 

62
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:03,520
so I need to know would you
like to go to neverland ranch, 

63
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:05,810
a catholic church or
Penn state university?

64
00:03:06,290 --> 00:03:07,710
We're havin' fun aren't we?

65
00:03:07,710 --> 00:03:10,470
I just- I come up with these
and the guys- it's good to laugh-

66
00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:14,450
I just asked them if they wanted to go to
neverland a catholic church or Penn state!

67
00:03:14,450 --> 00:03:16,550
I'm a trickster- people say
I'm really meant for comedy-

68
00:03:16,550 --> 00:03:18,510
Here's my head shot. Just
in case you know anybody.

69
00:03:18,510 --> 00:03:19,970
Can't hurt, right?Okay now-

70
00:03:19,970 --> 00:03:22,580
are we all starting to
feel a little bit better?

71
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:26,910
Oh, come on now, how about a smile.

72
00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:30,930
I am going to get you to smile!

73
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,770
A Penn state administrator
walks into a bar...

74
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:35,670
Where's that smile?

75
00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:39,510
How about this one
- joe paterno doesn't walk into a police station...

76
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:41,720
Come on, that's a good one.

77
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,650
did you hear anything
more about what happened?

78
00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:48,430
dude, I don't think kenny's coming back.

79
00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:51,730
My dad said those 'child protective
services' people are pretty serious.

80
00:03:51,730 --> 00:03:53,540
we can't just let kenny
be sent away for ever.

81
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:55,010
There's gotta be something we can do!

82
00:03:55,010 --> 00:03:57,950
guys, guys I've been working on it
and I think I have some answers.

83
00:03:57,950 --> 00:03:58,900
- really?
- yeah-

84
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:00,650
I've gone through every
student in the school

85
00:04:00,650 --> 00:04:04,410
and I'm pretty sure that now that now
that kenny's gone the poor kid is craig!

86
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:08,310
that's what you care about?! Who's
the poorest kid in school now?!

87
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:11,720
pretty much went through
everybody, craig's got the most

88
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:17,170
Hey craig, you're uh... Your family get
you that jacket at wal-mart or k-mart?

89
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:20,730
- what are you talking about?
- nothin', dude, it's cool, it's cool.

90
00:04:20,730 --> 00:04:22,880
I mean we would tell your
parents to shop at nicer places

91
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:25,920
but your momma's so poor, 
she can't even pay attention!

92
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:25,921
{7}***

93
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:34,620
Mr. And Mrs.Weatherhead we have
the new foster kids for your care.

94
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:36,110
very good. We'll take them from here.

95
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:38,040
Children enter.

96
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:42,920
Welcome to your new home. Before we show
you around let's get one thing clear.

97
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:46,050
This is a very
strict, religious household.

98
00:04:46,050 --> 00:04:49,420
As long as you live
here, you will be agnostic.

99
00:04:49,420 --> 00:04:51,550
These are your foster
brothers and sisters.

100
00:04:51,550 --> 00:04:53,790
They are all strict agnostics.

101
00:04:53,790 --> 00:04:55,620
David! Do you believe in god?!

102
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:57,850
- I don't know.
- right!

103
00:04:57,850 --> 00:05:00,560
There are two bedrooms
upstairs, boys' room and girls' room.

104
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,460
Your chores are listed
on the respective doors.

105
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:03,800
Follow.

106
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:05,900
You will eat only at
designated meal times.

107
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:08,650
Beverages you may take from
the refrigerator as you like.

108
00:05:08,650 --> 00:05:12,760
However, in this house you will
drink only agnostic beverages!

109
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:15,170
Dr. Pepper and diet Dr. Pepper.

110
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:18,400
Because what flavor is it? It
is neither root beer nor cola.

111
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:21,860
Nobody is sure what flavor it is and
nobody can be sure isn't that right...

112
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:24,610
- Melissa?!
- I don't know.

113
00:05:24,610 --> 00:05:26,260
good.

114
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:30,720
this is awesome, butters! You
really think you got something?!

115
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:33,163
yup. To find who the poorest kid is..

116
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:37,010
I actually was able to see which kids in school got those
coupons they hand out for school lunch.

117
00:05:37,010 --> 00:05:37,630
yeah?!

118
00:05:37,630 --> 00:05:40,410
so then I cross referenced all the
kids who were on half price lunches

119
00:05:40,410 --> 00:05:42,300
with the tax records of people in town

120
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:46,831
to see which kid's parents actually
made the least amount of money last year.

121
00:05:47,010 --> 00:05:50,000
wul, actually, eric, it's you.

122
00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:53,420
what?

123
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:57,700
now that kenny's gone, your household
actually has the lowest income.

124
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:00,600
I'm sorry, pal.

125
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:04,800
oh my god.

126
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:07,390
If we found this out, it's only a matter
of time before everyone else does.

127
00:06:07,390 --> 00:06:08,860
I won't tell anybody.

128
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:11,500
oh come on! We're not the only
ones who wanted to look into this!

129
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:15,200
You think kyle isn't on a computer right now
trying to see who the poorest kid in school is?!

130
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:19,100
oh, he is going to have such a
field day... That heartless jew.

131
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:20,990
Well, I won't give him the satisfaction.

132
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,220
alright, let's hear it for
kyle! He soo funny isn't he?!

133
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:28,670
With all his jokes
about cartman being poor!

134
00:06:28,670 --> 00:06:30,580
You guys hear how
poor cartman's mom is?!

135
00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:33,040
His mama's so poor the
ducks throw bread at her!

136
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:36,290
Yeah that's super funny, guys!
Yeah, laugh it up everyone!

137
00:06:36,290 --> 00:06:40,270
Cartman's mama's so poor that when she goes
to kfc she has to lick other people's fingers!

138
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:42,590
I beat you to it, kyle!

139
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:47,530
my name is not 'kyel'

140
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:52,150
that's kiwl!Whatever, kywl! It must
be nice having everything you want!

141
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,530
hi sweetie.

142
00:06:58,810 --> 00:07:00,630
sit down, mom, we need to have a talk.

143
00:07:00,630 --> 00:07:02,590
oh oh, what is it this time?

144
00:07:02,590 --> 00:07:05,250
mom... How are you going to start
bringing more money into this household?

145
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:06,260
what, hon?

146
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:09,400
you have to start doing more, mom.
what are you doing with your time?

147
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:13,400
eric, I'm working two jobs. Mommy
is doing everything she can.

148
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:17,630
yeah, see
- the problem, mom, is that with kenny's gone, I'm now the poorest kid in school.

149
00:07:17,630 --> 00:07:21,090
well, we're in a tough economy, eric, I don't
know what else you want me to do about it.

150
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:23,160
we're in a tough economy.

151
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:25,800
You don't know what else
I want you to do about it.

152
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:27,790
Life isn't handed to you mom!

153
00:07:27,790 --> 00:07:30,400
You can't just sit on your
ass and expect money to appear!

154
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,730
eric, we aren't that much
poorer than most people.

155
00:07:32,730 --> 00:07:33,990
not that much poorer?!

156
00:07:33,990 --> 00:07:38,120
My mama so poor when she heard about the last supper
she thought she was runnin' out of food stamps!

157
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:40,840
it's not funny, mom!

158
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:51,760
My mama so poor she waves around a popsicle
and calls it air conditioninnnngg...

159
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:58,730
I wish I could be put in a cool
foster home like kenny's familyyyy.

160
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:13,880
It's you.

161
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,640
I was wondering when you'd appear!
You always come when I'm sad!

162
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:21,390
you are going to be okay, karen.

163
00:08:21,390 --> 00:08:23,120
You have to keep believing that.

164
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:25,970
why did my mommy and daddy go to jail?

165
00:08:27,910 --> 00:08:30,600
sometimes... People do stupid things.

166
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:34,060
Sometimes they don't realize
what should have come first, until it's too late.

167
00:08:34,060 --> 00:08:36,980
- but I'm all alone now.
- you are not alone.

168
00:08:36,980 --> 00:08:39,770
No matter where you go.
No matter what you do.

169
00:08:39,770 --> 00:08:43,450
I will always be here.
Do you understand?

170
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:45,910
I'll try, guardian angel.

171
00:08:45,910 --> 00:08:49,100
Don't try, Karen. Do.

172
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:52,350
what in the name of nobody
knows are you doing, karen?!

173
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,580
policeman.

174
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:04,770
Yes... Yes...

175
00:09:04,770 --> 00:09:07,520
Alright thanks for the
tip. We'll check it out.

176
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:11,870
Better call the lieutenant. Looks
like we got another meth lab in town.

177
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:18,310
Got any needles on you? Any crack pipes.

178
00:09:18,310 --> 00:09:21,240
oh my, goodness, no. I haven't
used drugs in quite a while.

179
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:23,640
then why is there a meth
lab in your backyard?

180
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:26,840
what is going on here?
mom? What have you done?!

181
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:30,130
Were things so bad for you financially
you had to turn to a life of crime?

182
00:09:30,130 --> 00:09:32,850
My mama so poor, she uses
cheerios as earrings.

183
00:09:32,850 --> 00:09:35,800
Well.. Guess I'm off
to a foster home then.

184
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:37,460
Hawaii is my first choice.

185
00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:40,200
Something not exactly on the beach
but maybe just a short walk away...

186
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:43,060
It's going to take me years to recover
from being torn from my mother's arms.

187
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:46,060
Only the ocean breezes and
coconut trees can help me now.

188
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:50,100
when will you people learn to
lay off the pabst blue ribbon?!

189
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:53,090
Now look at the camera and say 'I'm
white trash and I'm in trouble'.

190
00:09:53,090 --> 00:09:56,030
oh, I'm white trash
- and I'm in trouble.

191
00:10:03,390 --> 00:10:04,570
hi there, how ya doing?

192
00:10:04,570 --> 00:10:07,900
My name's Mr. Adams and I'm
with child protective services ¨C

193
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:09,050
Here's my headshot.

194
00:10:09,050 --> 00:10:12,450
I just need to get some
information from you if that's okay.

195
00:10:12,450 --> 00:10:13,140
yeah yeah.

196
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:17,420
okay, now, it says here your
mother was operating a meth lab.

197
00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:18,450
that's right.

198
00:10:18,450 --> 00:10:24,020
And it also says here that Penn state
prefers to be losing at halftime...

199
00:10:24,150 --> 00:10:28,640
Because at Penn state they like when
you're a little behind in the locker room.

200
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:30,210
That's a joke! Did you get that one?

201
00:10:30,210 --> 00:10:32,950
It's is a play on words
we like to have fun here!

202
00:10:32,950 --> 00:10:34,670
dude, do you think this is funny?

203
00:10:34,670 --> 00:10:36,800
we just
- we just like to have fun here.

204
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:40,250
well I'll tell you something! Being
from a low income household isn't funny.

205
00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:44,990
Aw helll no, my mama so poor she opened a
gmail account just so she could eat the spam.

206
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:53,890
what... What's that supposed to be some
kind of joke? You think you're funny?

207
00:10:53,890 --> 00:10:56,120
a joke? You think being poor is a joke?

208
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:57,770
- could be worse.
- how?!

209
00:10:57,770 --> 00:10:59,140
could be in happy valley!

210
00:10:59,140 --> 00:11:02,660
On a scale from one to ten how old should
you be to stay away from Penn state?

211
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:05,550
dude, my mama so poor when she gets mad
she can't afford to fly off the handle

212
00:11:05,550 --> 00:11:08,030
so she gotta go
greyhound off the handle!

213
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:13,340
two Penn state administrators
walk into a butt ¨C

214
00:11:18,050 --> 00:11:20,640
jesus this is a long
drive, are we in hawaii yet?

215
00:11:21,310 --> 00:11:23,650
- hawaii?
- yeah, that's where I requested to be sent.

216
00:11:23,650 --> 00:11:27,310
you're foster home is here. Pretty
much the exact opposite of hawaii.

217
00:11:27,310 --> 00:11:28,810
what?!

218
00:11:31,470 --> 00:11:33,180
Greeley?!

219
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:38,360
come on now! This is not the
way we've told you tidy up.

220
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:40,910
Remember, cleanliness
is next to godliness.

221
00:11:40,910 --> 00:11:43,210
So make it kind of
clean but not too much.

222
00:11:43,210 --> 00:11:46,100
Amanda! More ambiguous on the dusting!

223
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:48,780
Kenneth, answer the door.

224
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:55,020
what the
- dude, this is like poorer than my old house!

225
00:11:55,020 --> 00:11:57,000
what the are you doing here?

226
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,000
hello, eric. Your room is upstairs
on the left. Are you hungry?

227
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,440
- you're my new mom?
- you can call my mom if you like.

228
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:06,220
alright, mom, how much money do you make?
Like gross yearly income after taxes?

229
00:12:08,340 --> 00:12:10,970
this is where you will sleep
with your foster brothers.

230
00:12:10,970 --> 00:12:15,790
You will be clean, polite and most
importantly you will follow the agnostic code!

231
00:12:15,790 --> 00:12:18,540
"we cannot know with certainty if
god or christ exists. They could.

232
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:21,400
Then again there could be a giant
reptilian bird in charge of everything.

233
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:23,650
Can we be certain there isn't?
No, so it's pointless to talk about.

234
00:12:23,650 --> 00:12:24,760
" Now say it with me...

235
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:28,530
god damn, I gotta sleep in a room
six other people?! How poor are we?!

236
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,370
We do not take the lord's name in vain
in this house just in case there is one!

237
00:12:32,370 --> 00:12:35,490
Do you understand or do you
need the punishment room?!

238
00:12:35,490 --> 00:12:37,060
aw hellll no.

239
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:39,770
Moooooom! Dad's being mean to me!

240
00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:43,220
Momm! Moooooommm!

241
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:47,860
my name is not 'meeeem'.

242
00:12:52,350 --> 00:12:55,650
oh god I'm so nervous. These
kids all seem kind of mean...

243
00:12:55,650 --> 00:12:57,600
I'll see you at recess, right.

244
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,260
I'll be there, karen.

245
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:03,120
you've already been here a while, kenny, you
have to introduce me to your friends, okay?

246
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,610
And make sure they know I'm cool!

247
00:13:04,610 --> 00:13:06,760
You gotta have my back kenny!

248
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:09,410
- oh hey kenny.
- Who's this? this is eric cartman.

249
00:13:09,410 --> 00:13:10,860
does he live with you
at the foster home?

250
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:14,010
okay alright so listen! I
know our family is poor, okay?!

251
00:13:14,010 --> 00:13:16,530
But before we lived there, kenny
was actually poorer than me.

252
00:13:16,530 --> 00:13:19,080
So technically he is the
poorest kid at this school!

253
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:23,240
what are you talking about? The poor
kid in this school is jacob hallery.

254
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:26,800
- really?
- yeah dude, 

255
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:29,770
his dad died five years ago and
his mom went crazy from depression

256
00:13:29,770 --> 00:13:31,680
so she can't even keep a job.

257
00:13:32,230 --> 00:13:35,630
yes! Yyesss! Did you hear
that kenny?! We're good!

258
00:13:35,630 --> 00:13:37,930
I seriously thought we didn't
stand a chance but now...

259
00:13:37,930 --> 00:13:39,980
Everything's gonna be okay!

let put our hands up everyone!

269
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:08,680
Except for jacob, his momma's so
poor she only understands hand outs.

270
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:16,060
eric, at greeley elementary, we do not tolerate
student's making fun of other students.

271
00:14:16,060 --> 00:14:17,620
I wasn't making fun of anybody.

272
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:20,260
a twenty minute song and dance number, 

273
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:25,260
with forty seven "yo mama so poor"
jokes  directed at jacob hallery

274
00:14:25,530 --> 00:14:28,080
which ended in a finale with fireworks.

275
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:30,260
I was just teasing.

276
00:14:30,530 --> 00:14:33,750
your case worker has been
notified and he is not happy.

277
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:36,160
My case work..
- Aw, no, not this guy.

278
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:39,310
I now this is a difficult
adjustment for you, eric.

279
00:14:39,310 --> 00:14:43,400
But you can't just turn all your frustrations
on a little kid who can't defend himself!

280
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:46,030
I mean what do you think this
is the shower room at Penn state?

281
00:14:46,030 --> 00:14:48,420
I'm kidding! We like to
have fun in our department-

282
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:51,390
so I was like what is the
shower room at Penn state?

283
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:53,360
I joke around
- this is my head shot.

284
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:55,690
will you stop with
the Penn state jokes?!

285
00:14:55,690 --> 00:14:59,330
All you're doing is taking something
topical and revamping old catholic jokes.

286
00:15:00,460 --> 00:15:04,980
oh and "yo mama" jokes are better?
They've been around since the fifties.

287
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:07,980
what the hell does this
have to do with anything!

288
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:10,100
principal! You gotta send
help to the playground-

289
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:12,120
they're about to beat up that new kid!

290
00:15:13,930 --> 00:15:16,900
aw, look at the new kid
and her wittle dolly?!

291
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:19,180
You gonna cry some more in class, wimp?!

292
00:15:19,180 --> 00:15:20,740
l-leave her alone.

293
00:15:20,740 --> 00:15:23,960
shut up, you foster
twerps are all the same!

294
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:26,340
Come on, hand over the doll!

295
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:32,350
Who the hell is this?

296
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:35,630
how about you find another
little girl to pick on?

297
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:38,530
mind your business peter pan!

298
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,540
karen mckormick is off
limits. Do you understand?

299
00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:50,220
Make sure everybody
in this school knows.

300
00:15:59,370 --> 00:16:03,650
and if this food comes as a gift
from some divine intelligence, 

301
00:16:03,650 --> 00:16:08,720
we understand that an intelligent being
cannot blame us for questioning its existence.

302
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:12,510
Nobody knows, and nobody can know
if any deity is watching over us.

303
00:16:12,510 --> 00:16:13,320
Amen.

304
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:16,380
except for karen's guardian angel!

305
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:17,140
what?

306
00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:20,450
where did he take you
after he saved you, karen?

307
00:16:20,450 --> 00:16:23,950
he just took me back to my classroom!
Then he disappeared like always.

308
00:16:23,950 --> 00:16:27,070
what have we told you about
making up angel stories?!

309
00:16:27,070 --> 00:16:30,730
but we saw him! He
leapt down from the sky!

310
00:16:30,730 --> 00:16:34,140
and he kicked the crap
out of jessica pinkerton.

311
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:35,670
- We saw him!
- Yay!

312
00:16:35,670 --> 00:16:39,960
stop it children! We do not speak
such certainties in this house!

313
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:42,180
get down to the basement all of you!

314
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:45,330
It's time for the punishment room!

315
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:53,610
now... Did you see an angel?

316
00:16:53,610 --> 00:16:56,200
no! No I didn't see an angel!

317
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:59,210
no! You can't be certain of
that! You might have seen one!

318
00:16:59,210 --> 00:17:01,450
Hit him with the doctor pepper again.

319
00:17:04,730 --> 00:17:07,050
are there such things as angels?

320
00:17:07,050 --> 00:17:09,580
- m-maybe?
- good.

321
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:12,330
what do we do kenny?

322
00:17:12,620 --> 00:17:13,980
Kenny?

323
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:18,200
- what is the meaning of life?!
- it's impossible to know!

324
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:19,700
that's right!

325
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:22,800
who could that be?

326
00:17:25,370 --> 00:17:28,570
Mr.And Mrs.Weatherhead, I've
received some disturbing news that

327
00:17:28,570 --> 00:17:32,700
all you are providing the foster
children here to drink is soda.

328
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:34,730
I told on you, mom and dad!

329
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:36,850
what business is that of yours?!

330
00:17:36,850 --> 00:17:40,800
it's my business because child protective
services is accountable for these kids!

331
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:42,150
Have I given you my headshot?

332
00:17:42,150 --> 00:17:43,260
yes, yes, we have that.

333
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:46,380
ok, now are you only giving
these kids Dr. Pepper to drink?!

334
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:50,610
if we want to serve agnostic beverages
in this house then by god-ish we'll do it!

335
00:17:50,610 --> 00:17:55,350
The children you've sent here are undisciplined
and talking about certainty of angels!

336
00:17:58,300 --> 00:17:59,760
excuse me?!

337
00:18:00,540 --> 00:18:02,340
Let's have a look around.

338
00:18:05,850 --> 00:18:08,960
what the
- who did this?

339
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:12,420
what is that?!

340
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:24,340
It was a like a little
'mystery' person flying around...

341
00:18:24,340 --> 00:18:28,250
almost seemed like some
kind of... Agnostic angel.

342
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:39,570
oh my god.

343
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:42,500
What's going on here?

344
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:46,360
we don't know... We
can't possibly know...

345
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:47,560
what have I done?

346
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:51,550
I took you kids from your parents without
even checking into where you were going?

347
00:18:51,550 --> 00:18:54,410
I put innocent children
into a dangerous environment!

348
00:18:54,410 --> 00:18:57,840
What am I? A recruitment
coach for Penn state?

349
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:01,900
it's not funny!

350
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:06,620
there's nothing in there
but dr. Pepper, right?

351
00:19:06,620 --> 00:19:08,140
There can't be.

352
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:14,860
how did that get here?!

353
00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:19,330
- It's says it's a 'pabst blue ribbon.
- ' what is it?

354
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:23,270
It's like beer but different.

355
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:25,730
But how did it get here?!

356
00:19:31,010 --> 00:19:32,470
Shut your mouth bitch!

357
00:19:32,470 --> 00:19:35,940
You shut your mouth you dumb 
fucking asshole!

358
00:19:36,230 --> 00:19:37,100
Fuck you bitch!

359
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:38,630
you have the right to remain silent.

360
00:19:38,630 --> 00:19:41,230
Now look at the camera and say
I'm white trash and I'm in trouble!

361
00:19:41,230 --> 00:19:44,240
I'm white trash and iii'mmm in trouble!

362
00:19:44,740 --> 00:19:46,100
get in the car, you!

363
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:48,740
Wait a minute, I'm white
trash, and I'm in trouble?!

364
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:52,990
No, no, take all these kids
back to their parents.

365
00:19:52,990 --> 00:19:56,970
We've embarrassed the system and
made it something nobody wants to be a part of.

366
00:19:56,970 --> 00:20:00,990
It's like a Penn state
homecoming party...

367
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:05,030
A false police report can carry a
up to a two month prison term, son!

368
00:20:05,030 --> 00:20:05,900
I'm not saying it.

369
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:08,340
We can do this the easy
way or we can do it hard!

370
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:09,420
I'm not saying it!

371
00:20:09,420 --> 00:20:11,530
Then we'll add another
charge for resisting!

372
00:20:11,530 --> 00:20:14,550
okay fine! I'm white
trash and I'm in trouble!

373
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:17,780
three arrests in just
one power packed episode.

374
00:20:17,780 --> 00:20:19,360
Proving once again that

375
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:23,190
we are all just one pabst
blue ribbon away from becoming-

376
00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:25,260
white trash!In trouble

379
00:20:34,610 --> 00:20:36,900
I hear your parents might
give up selling meth for good.

380
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:38,190
yeah, maybe.

381

383
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:45,730
And you know guys
- there's an important lesson, I think we've all learned.

384
00:20:45,730 --> 00:20:48,010
What do we do when
the tables are turned?

My mamma so poor she walks
down the road with one shoeeeee!

396
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:36,260
And if you ask her if she lost a
