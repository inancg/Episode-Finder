

4
00:00:34,220 --> 00:00:38,520
Okay,kids,we have  something very
serious we need  to discuss today,m'kay.

5
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:43,500
It appears that some kids in  school
are getting high by  choking themselves.

6
00:00:43,690 --> 00:00:49,660
Some kids call it the choking 
game,m'kay,but choking  yourself is bad,m'kay.

7
00:00:49,660 --> 00:00:52,960
Don't do that,m'kay.

8
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:55,470
You can get high from choking yourself?

9
00:00:55,470 --> 00:00:56,390
Hrggggggg!

10
00:00:56,390 --> 00:01:00,250
School children are often  experimenting
with dangerous  ways to get high.

11
00:01:00,250 --> 00:01:05,050
M'kay,like sniffing glue,guzzling
cough medicine,huffing paint,m'kay.

12
00:01:05,050 --> 00:01:07,420
But they're all bad.M'kay?

13
00:01:07,420 --> 00:01:12,410
My cousins in florida said  kids
in their school get off of  cat pee.

14
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:13,680
Cat pee?

15
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:16,410
That's not true.You can't get
high off of cat  urine.Can you?

16
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:19,120
Well,it's not actually cat  urine.

17
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:22,460
But male cats,when they are
 marking their territory,

18
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:26,600
spray a concentrated urine
to fend off  other male cats.

19
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:29,320
And that can get you really  high.M'kay?

20
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:33,290
Really,really high,m'kay.

21
00:01:34,690 --> 00:01:38,850
Probably shouldn't have
told you that just now,m'kay.

22
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:41,450
That was probably bad.

23
00:01:43,250 --> 00:01:46,370
All right.This should keep my cat
in place while he sprays the urine.

24
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:50,280
Yes,poor mitew kitty,are
you  just so upset right now?

25
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:53,300
You guys are wasting your  time.

26
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:55,080
Yeah,it's not gonna work.

27
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:57,800
Okay.You ready,kenny?

28
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:59,160
- All set!
- All right.

29
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:02,590
Bring out the other male cat.

30
00:02:23,070 --> 00:02:24,090
Do you feel anything?

31
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:26,390
Well,kenny?Are you buzzed?

32
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:49,370
Cool!Check it out!

33
00:03:51,970 --> 00:03:56,690
I see that you are enticed by my
daughter's awesome,rocking  tits.

34
00:03:56,690 --> 00:03:57,550
Yeah.

35
00:03:57,550 --> 00:04:01,040
Then bathe with my daughter
 in the fountain of varnoth.

36
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:04,790
Appease the gods by lathering
 her boobs with soapy suds.

37
00:04:04,790 --> 00:04:06,890
Okay!

38
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:18,140
Kenny.Kenny,wake up.

39
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:20,400
Wake up,kenny.You all right?

40
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:22,310
Kenny!Wait.

41
00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:23,630
Where'd she go?

42
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:25,490
Dude,that cat urine really  You up!

43
00:04:25,490 --> 00:04:27,140
You were seriously tripping  balls.

44
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:28,170
You Asshole!

45
00:04:28,170 --> 00:04:29,900
Agh!Kenny!Knock it
off!What's wrong with you?

46
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:31,710
Why couldn't you leave me  alone!

47
00:04:31,710 --> 00:04:32,450
Dude!

48
00:04:32,450 --> 00:04:34,570
Dude,kenny,calm down.

49
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:37,800
Oh,I was so close!

50
00:04:38,090 --> 00:04:40,980
You should have seen her  titties.

51
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:42,460
What titties?

52
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:43,890
The titties!

53
00:04:43,890 --> 00:04:46,580
On the girl,they were  incredible!

54
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:50,670
Kenny,all you did after the  cat peed in your face
was start  running around in circles  cheering.

55
00:04:50,670 --> 00:04:54,290
Yeah,then you ran through  town screaming
and started  tearing off all your clothes.

56
00:04:54,850 --> 00:04:57,860
I almost touched them.

57
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:02,930
Dude,I don't think we should be
messing around with that crap anymore.

58
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:06,310
Next on
fox news --

59
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:10,690
it's the newest drug craze
and  it's killing your kids!

60
00:05:10,690 --> 00:05:12,180
Killing our kids?

61
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:16,440
All over america kids are
 getting high on cat urine.

62
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:22,600
Huffing cat urine apparently  causes a euphoric
state and is  also referred to as "cheesing.

63
00:05:22,910 --> 00:05:23,920
" Why cheesing?

64
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:26,210
Because it's "fon to due.

65
00:05:26,210 --> 00:05:30,840
"   This sixth grade girl says  she's
been snorting cat piss for several months.

66
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:35,770
We sometimes sneak out during recess and
our friend named  Goes and gets her cats.

67
00:05:35,770 --> 00:05:38,300
And we'll just cheese all day  long.

68
00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:40,060
Oh,my god!Sheila!

69
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:41,090
Come look at this!

70
00:05:41,090 --> 00:05:43,890
So how can you tell if
your  child is cheesing?

71
00:05:43,890 --> 00:05:46,750
One,your child seems
distant,preoccupied.

72
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:49,700
Two,your child's face
smells  like cat urine.

73
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:54,390
Three,when you see tigers at  the zoo,your
child starts  grinding his or her teeth.

74
00:05:54,390 --> 00:05:59,160
You might also notice by certain phrases
your child says to  school friends,such as --

75
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:00,700
"hey,let's go cheese.

76
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:03,140
" Or "do you feel like cheesing,guys?

77
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:07,200
" Or "dude,I'm cheesing my
f-ing  brains out right now.

78
00:06:07,610 --> 00:06:09,240
"   Kids are doing this?

79
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:11,950
Kids do it because it's  legal.

80
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:15,170
What can you do before it's too  late?

81
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:20,810
We have to protect our 
children from this,sheila.

82
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:28,220
20% of american students aged 6 to 12 say
they have tried  cheesing at least once.

83
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:31,170
Kids also refer to it as "the 
cheese game," or "vitamin  cheese,"

84
00:06:31,170 --> 00:06:36,070
or "mary jane/piss in
 your face fun time.

85
00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:38,320
" Cheesing is spreading fast.

86
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:41,400
All right.We're all sufficiently
scared,gerald,but what can we do?

87
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:47,070
I have written up a bill that would make
having a cat illegal  in the city of south park.

88
00:06:48,170 --> 00:06:50,950
Gerald's right.We have to face it.

89
00:06:50,950 --> 00:06:52,880
Cats are deadly animals.

90
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:57,070
If you stick your nose up their  crotch
and snort their piss,they can kill you.

91
00:06:57,070 --> 00:07:00,570
With my super lawyer powers
 we can rid our town of cats

92
00:07:00,570 --> 00:07:03,920
so  that our kids can
never get high again!

93
00:07:04,450 --> 00:07:06,860
Let's hear it for gerald!

94
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:09,990
Let's hear it for gerald!

95
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:18,840
No!

96
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:20,060
No!

97
00:07:21,530 --> 00:07:24,110
Get over it druggie.Jeez!

98
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:27,370
Goodbye,scrambles.We'll miss you.

99
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:33,330
Got two here.

100
00:07:33,330 --> 00:07:35,030
Hey,what the Are you doing?

101
00:07:35,030 --> 00:07:36,630
Sorry,these are illegal.

102
00:07:36,630 --> 00:07:37,190
What?

103
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:37,940
No!

104
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:39,610
What are you doing?

105
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:42,020
Hey,[Bleep] You!

106
00:07:43,330 --> 00:07:45,210
Look,I told you.I had a cat.

107
00:07:45,210 --> 00:07:48,070
But I had it put to sleep
 because it pissed me off.

108
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,130
Shhh.

109
00:07:53,130 --> 00:07:55,610
Mister kitty,you have to
live  in the attic for now.

110
00:07:55,610 --> 00:07:56,400
Here.

111
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:57,870
Write a diary.

112
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,320
Guys,have you seen kenny?

113
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:06,160
No,I think kenny's out sick  today.

114
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:08,570
Yeah,and he was out sick  yesterday too.

115
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:14,870
Guys,I think kenny isn't here
 because he's at home cheesing.

116
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:17,390
Aw,come on.

117
00:08:17,390 --> 00:08:19,900
Kenny knows how dangerous  cheesing is.

118
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:22,230
Yeah,and where's he gonna  find
cats anyway?They've been outlawed.

119
00:08:22,230 --> 00:08:25,670
Yeah,who has cats these  days?Ha,ha.

120
00:08:25,670 --> 00:08:28,590
Pot's illegal too but people
 still manage to find it!

121
00:08:28,590 --> 00:08:32,180
Ever since that first time kenny
cheesed he hasn't been the same.

122
00:08:32,180 --> 00:08:34,580
You've all noticed the change in him!

123
00:08:35,230 --> 00:08:38,610
I'll bet kenny is home
cheesing  right now.

124
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:36,910
Kenny?

125
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:38,890
Kenny,you home?

126
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:50,950
Kenny?

127
00:09:53,540 --> 00:09:56,050
Oh,boy.He's cheesed out his mind!

128
00:10:03,710 --> 00:10:05,340
Kenny

129
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:09,150
There you go.

130
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:11,080
Try some coffee,ken.

131
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:17,020
Kenny,we need to have a  serious talk.

132
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:19,160
No,we don't,guys.

133
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:20,360
Yes,we do.

134
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:22,900
We're your friends,dude.And we're
not gonna let you ruin your life.

135
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:24,550
I'm not ruining my life.

136
00:10:24,550 --> 00:10:26,780
Will you guys just
back the  [Bleep] Off?

137
00:10:26,780 --> 00:10:27,980
Look at yourself!

138
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:30,290
You've got to lay off the  cheese!

139
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:36,000
Yeah,that's it,little  buddy.

140
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,570
Just let it out.

141
00:10:37,570 --> 00:10:39,510
Kenny,i know we're super
 cool and everything,

142
00:10:39,510 --> 00:10:42,680
but if we  ever catch you cheesing
again,we're gonna tell on you.

143
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:44,430
Ugh,okay.Okay.

144
00:10:44,430 --> 00:10:45,720
I just want to sleep now.

145
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:49,280
Yeah,he needs some sleepny 
night-night,doesn't the buddy?

146
00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:53,260
We gotta keep this away from  him.

147
00:11:01,270 --> 00:11:03,750
Miter kitty!Shhhh!

148
00:11:04,870 --> 00:11:06,570
Dammit!

149
00:11:07,990 --> 00:11:09,910
Shhhh.Mitew kitty,you have to but  tuiet

150
00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:12,030
or else they're gonna find you!

151
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:15,600
What?

152
00:11:18,310 --> 00:11:19,420
The neighbor cat.

153
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:21,300
He hasn't been caught yet.

154
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:23,550
No,no,mitew kitty.

155
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:26,010
I know you like rufus,but
he  has to fend for himself.

156
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:29,060
I can't hide anymore cats,mitew kitty.

157
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:31,060
I'm in trouble enough as it is.

158
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:33,770
All right,all right.Fine.

159
00:11:37,610 --> 00:11:40,550
All right,come on,rufus.Quietly.

160
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:47,500
Oh,jesus,no!No,I can't hide you all!

161
00:11:49,290 --> 00:11:52,200
I'm sorry.You'll just have
to find  somewhere else to --

162
00:11:55,470 --> 00:11:59,620
Well,i suppose I'll get in just as
much trouble for four cats as for two.

163
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:01,620
Come on.

164
00:12:11,410 --> 00:12:12,930
Huh?

165
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:19,280
Oh,my god!

166
00:12:19,970 --> 00:12:21,260
Kyle?

167
00:12:21,260 --> 00:12:24,410
Kyle,can we talk to you
for a  minute,please?

168
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:25,730
Yeah?

169
00:12:25,730 --> 00:12:28,770
Kyle,have you been getting  high?

170
00:12:28,930 --> 00:12:29,830
No.

171
00:12:29,830 --> 00:12:34,430
Then why did your mother find
this in your dressing drawer?

172
00:12:36,710 --> 00:12:38,630
All right.Look,that isn't mine.

173
00:12:38,630 --> 00:12:40,180
I'm just holding it for a  friend.

174
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:41,820
Don't lie to us,kyle!

175
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:44,450
How long have you been on the cheese?

176
00:12:45,410 --> 00:12:46,380
I'm not cheesing!

177
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:48,090
I've never cheesed once in my  life!

178
00:12:48,090 --> 00:12:49,840
Get up to your room right  now.

179
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:52,250
Until your mother and I figure
 out how to deal with this.

180
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:53,870
Dad,will you just listen
to  me for a second.

181
00:12:53,870 --> 00:12:55,320
Now,kyle!

182
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:57,090
God!

183
00:12:57,410 --> 00:12:59,140
Gerald,what are we gonna do?

184
00:12:59,140 --> 00:13:00,880
Our son is a cat pee addict!

185
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:03,400
First thing is we've
got to  dispose of this.

186
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:04,350
What are you going to do?

187
00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:07,090
I better just take it down
to the basement for now.

188
00:13:07,090 --> 00:13:09,530
Make sure kyle can't find it.

189
00:13:14,770 --> 00:13:16,560
No,no.What am i thinking?

190
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:18,450
I shouldn't don't this.

191
00:13:19,190 --> 00:13:21,740
I've been clean for ten years.

192
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:23,910
I haven't even been near a cat.

193
00:13:23,910 --> 00:13:26,680
But then that report said
our  kids were doing it,too.

194
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:30,030
I knew kyle would have the same
 sickness as I used to have.

195
00:13:30,030 --> 00:13:33,940
Now a cat is in our home
and  it's too tempting.

196
00:13:38,140 --> 00:13:40,390
I,I'll just do it one more  time.

197
00:13:40,390 --> 00:13:42,440
One last time.

198
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:46,090
Then I'll call the police,have
 them pick up the cat.

199
00:13:46,090 --> 00:13:48,260
And I'll never do it again.

200
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:52,920
After this one last time.

201
00:14:59,630 --> 00:15:01,570
I couldn't stay away.

202
00:15:01,570 --> 00:15:04,690
Curse your rockin' tits.

203
00:15:06,060 --> 00:15:08,350
- Who is it?
- Please,open the door.

204
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:12,430
They say you're hiding cats!

205
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:16,160
Hiding cats?That would be illegal!

206
00:15:16,390 --> 00:15:17,630
You don't understand.

207
00:15:17,630 --> 00:15:21,110
My little nishka,she
has  nowhere else to go.

208
00:15:21,110 --> 00:15:23,980
Oh,no!No,I cannot
possibly take in  another.

209
00:15:23,980 --> 00:15:25,420
But they will find her.

210
00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:28,230
I've already taken in the 
anderson's cats,the wolitsky'S.

211
00:15:28,230 --> 00:15:31,020
There is simply
nothing else I  can --

212
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:37,660
then again,perhaps I could find
space for just this one more.

213
00:15:37,660 --> 00:15:42,260
Oh,you show such kindness
in such darkest of times.

214
00:15:49,890 --> 00:15:51,730
What the hell?

215
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:59,820
Kenny,get outta here!

216
00:16:02,140 --> 00:16:04,000
Oh,crap!Kenny!

217
00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:06,730
Bad kitties.

218
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:13,340
Dad!Somebody's at the front door!

219
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:17,390
Well,am I grounded or not?

220
00:16:18,550 --> 00:16:20,370
Fine!I'll get it!

221
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:24,260
Dude,we've got a big  problem!

222
00:16:24,260 --> 00:16:26,320
Cartman says kenny is really  messed up.

223
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:29,240
He's cheesing his  Balls off,dude!

224
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:30,370
What?

225
00:16:30,370 --> 00:16:33,790
He apparently got to all the  cats
cartman's been hiding in  his attic.

226
00:16:33,790 --> 00:16:35,770
What are you doing with
cats  in your attic,fat ass?

227
00:16:35,770 --> 00:16:37,630
They're innocent victims in  this,kyle!

228
00:16:37,630 --> 00:16:39,110
They have to hide or
they'll be  put to death.

229
00:16:39,110 --> 00:16:41,360
Something you just can't  understand.

230
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:45,060
Come on.We gotta find kenny
before he  hurts himself.

231
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:47,710
I can't!My dad grounded me!

232
00:16:48,410 --> 00:16:49,200
Wait a minute.

233
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:50,850
Where is my dad?

234
00:16:58,630 --> 00:17:00,570
Hey,everybody!

235
00:17:00,570 --> 00:17:02,700
Good to seeya again!

236
00:17:13,130 --> 00:17:14,490
Hold!

237
00:17:14,490 --> 00:17:19,120
You cannot yet caress my 
daughter's awesome boobage.

238
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:20,860
How come?

239
00:17:20,860 --> 00:17:24,990
There is another suitor.

240
00:17:26,730 --> 00:17:27,880
What?

241
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,410
Get outta here,kid!

242
00:17:29,410 --> 00:17:31,430
Dude,You!That's my girl!

243
00:17:31,430 --> 00:17:33,390
You're too young for this  stuff!

244
00:17:33,390 --> 00:17:38,120
This must be decided in the
 breastriary in nipopolis!

245
00:17:48,450 --> 00:17:52,370
Now fight!For the locknar trophy!

246
00:18:34,070 --> 00:18:34,860
Dad?

247
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:37,260
Dad!What the hell are you doing?

248
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:40,080
They been going at it
for a  good 30 minutes.

249
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:42,090
She's mine,you little  asshole!

250
00:18:42,090 --> 00:18:44,220
Get the Off me!

251
00:18:44,710 --> 00:18:46,720
Gerald?

252
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:52,550
The key proponent of the cat  ban has been
charged with  cheesing in a public park.

253
00:18:52,550 --> 00:18:56,240
Gerald broflovski is prepared
to give a public statement.

254
00:18:56,670 --> 00:18:59,170
I would like to address
a  personal matter.

255
00:18:59,170 --> 00:19:03,950
I have let myself down and I  would first
like to apologize to my lovely wife --

256
00:19:03,950 --> 00:19:05,250
Don't touch me.

257
00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:07,260
And to the people of south  park.

258
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:08,500
I was wrong.

259
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:11,430
And I can't let cats
take the  fall anymore.

260
00:19:11,430 --> 00:19:13,010
It's our fault.

261
00:19:13,010 --> 00:19:16,410
The people who use cats
for  their sweet urine.

262
00:19:16,410 --> 00:19:19,900
We have to learn that
cheesing  just isn't worth it.

263
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:22,260
Sure,you get to fight
in the  breastriary

264
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:26,730
and swim in the  fountains of varnoth with
the  ittytitty fairies of mamary  mountain.

265
00:19:26,730 --> 00:19:28,230
What the hell is he talking  about?

266
00:19:28,230 --> 00:19:29,620
I have no idea.

267
00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:32,780
And then you fight the 
boobgoblin in the gazangas cave.

268
00:19:32,780 --> 00:19:37,450
And then the girl may thank
you  for it,but she isn't real.

269
00:19:37,450 --> 00:19:40,980
And you never really get a  good
look at her naked boobs  anyway.

270
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:45,680
Problem is the more you go  into
that world,the more you  need to go.

271
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:49,780
Until you start blowing off all 
the real people who care about  you.

272
00:19:49,780 --> 00:19:52,580
Yeah,I guess so.

273
00:19:52,580 --> 00:19:54,540
Cats aren't the problem.

274
00:19:54,540 --> 00:19:58,740
We made cats illegal,and then i cheesed
for the first time in  ten years.

275
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:01,680
And kids are always going to
 find a new way to get high.

276
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:06,280
Like sniffing glue or licking  toads
or fermenting feces or  huffing paint.

277
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:09,370
- You can also
- Okay,that's probably good,gerald.

278
00:20:09,370 --> 00:20:11,320
The point is I was wrong.

279
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:15,470
It's time to legalize cats.Yeah!

280
00:20:15,470 --> 00:20:16,670
Hooray for gerald!

281
00:20:16,670 --> 00:20:19,310
Let's hear it for gerald!

282
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:25,920
Scrambles!

283
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:27,480
So good to have you back.

284
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:29,400
You ain't sore at us,are you?

285
00:20:33,590 --> 00:20:35,110
I'm sure glad that's over  with.

286
00:20:35,110 --> 00:20:36,520
Me too.

287
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:38,580
But you know,we've all 
aneato fed something,you guys.

288
00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:42,360
We can never persecute living  beings and
force them into  hidinvel it's okaonvel

289
00:20:43,340 --> 00:20:46,930
And you don't see any  parallel between
that and  anything else in history?

290
00:20:47,970 --> 00:20:48,630
nope.

291
00:20:48,630 --> 00:20:50,660
I have no idea what
you're  talking about,kyle.

292
00:20:50,660 --> 00:20:52,510
You guys!Check it out!

293
00:20:52,510 --> 00:20:54,310
It's kenny.

294
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:59,110
Isn't that great?He's
just getting high on life.

295
00:20:59,110 --> 00:21:00,600
Yeah.

296
00:21:04,370 --> 00:21:07,080
He's getting really high on  lifE.

297
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:13,140
Dude,he's getting super  wasted on life.

298
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:15,020
Kenny!

299
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:18,340
What the hell kind of flowers are those?

300
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:19,340
Kenny?

301
00:21:19,340 --> 00:21:20,880
Kenny?



9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
