00:00:35,169 --> 00:00:36,367
[You are not meant to see]

2
00:00:36,402 --> 00:00:37,607
What's going on, dad?

3
00:00:37,642 --> 00:00:39,892
Mr. Marsh you have to move, it isn't...

4
00:00:49,268 --> 00:00:53,104
Oh god... I'm... I'm so startled.

5
00:00:55,668 --> 00:01:00,078
Pandemic 2
The Startling

6
00:01:02,936 --> 00:01:05,035
My name is Craig Tucker.

7
00:01:05,114 --> 00:01:07,177
Last week was my bithday.

8
00:01:07,865 --> 00:01:10,365
My grandma gave me a check for a $100.

9
00:01:10,365 --> 00:01:12,365
I was so happy.

10
00:01:12,822 --> 00:01:16,081
But then four kids from school came to my house

11
00:01:16,081 --> 00:01:20,214
and said I should use my $100 for investment becoming...

12
00:01:20,214 --> 00:01:22,457
a peruvian flute band.

13
00:01:22,514 --> 00:01:25,365
They promised I would double my money in one afternoon.

14
00:01:25,365 --> 00:01:27,106
But the government arrested us

15
00:01:27,106 --> 00:01:29,491
along with all the other peruvian flute bands

16
00:01:29,491 --> 00:01:31,540
and took us to internment camp in Miami.

17
00:01:31,912 --> 00:01:33,818
We begged to go home but instead

18
00:01:33,818 --> 00:01:36,255
the government told us they were sending us to Peru.

19
00:01:39,664 --> 00:01:42,653
And so that is why I am in Peru.

20
00:01:42,914 --> 00:01:47,276
If I die, let in be known that it is because four guys I don't even like

21
00:01:47,276 --> 00:01:50,094
from school lied to me and took my birthday money.

22
00:01:50,335 --> 00:01:52,391
We didn't lied, Craig. It was a sweet idea.

23
00:01:52,481 --> 00:01:55,479
Yeah, how do we supposed to know that panflute bands would be an outlaw.

24
00:01:56,412 --> 00:01:58,759
I don't get it, they said the military would meet us here.

25
00:01:58,809 --> 00:02:02,008
This is where they told us to land. Can you get through to Washington?

26
00:02:02,068 --> 00:02:02,911
- I'm trying.

27
00:02:02,911 --> 00:02:04,676
This is Coner in Washington.

28
00:02:04,676 --> 00:02:08,497
Hey, Coner, the players at homeland security told us to start the operation.

29
00:02:08,497 --> 00:02:11,826
There's nobody here to meet us. It's like they sent us to no man's land.

30
00:02:11,826 --> 00:02:13,826
Jesus, they're everywhere.

31
00:02:14,093 --> 00:02:15,226
What are everywhere?

32
00:02:15,998 --> 00:02:21,203
So furry. They're attacking... every city...

33
00:02:21,494 --> 00:02:27,631
People dying... Guinea pigs... All over...

34
00:02:28,032 --> 00:02:29,085
Guinea pigs?

35
00:02:29,176 --> 00:02:33,157
Can't stop them... Need to get out...

36
00:02:33,969 --> 00:02:41,601
I just ate... a peanut... peanut now stuck in throat...

37
00:02:41,802 --> 00:02:45,151
Shouldn't eat peanuts... when scared...

38
00:02:52,322 --> 00:02:54,749
I've got the videocamera, got it turned on again.

39
00:02:55,371 --> 00:03:00,184
Okay. This is Randy Marsh, I'm shooting this video of myself.

40
00:03:00,896 --> 00:03:04,126
20 minutes ago some huge creatures attacked our town.

41
00:03:04,376 --> 00:03:06,272
It's still chaos out the window.

42
00:03:09,601 --> 00:03:11,216
I barely made it back to the house.

43
00:03:12,138 --> 00:03:16,351
Sharon is here with me. And there's Shelley. Wave to the camera, Shelley.

44
00:03:16,441 --> 00:03:19,489
Randy! Will you put down that camera? We need to figure out what to do.

45
00:03:19,489 --> 00:03:21,585
I don't know what to do. I'm so startled.

46
00:03:21,585 --> 00:03:23,585
We have to see what the news is saying.

47
00:03:25,707 --> 00:03:30,160
This is a shot of NYC where the giant guinea pigs have also attacked.

48
00:03:30,501 --> 00:03:31,514
Guinea pigs?

49
00:03:31,514 --> 00:03:34,733
Reports of attacks are coming from major cities all over the world.

50
00:03:34,994 --> 00:03:36,733
Jesus, the thing is worldwide.

51
00:03:42,144 --> 00:03:43,528
Look at that thing.

52
00:03:44,892 --> 00:03:46,336
Randy, what are we gonna do?

53
00:03:51,571 --> 00:03:53,326
Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god!

54
00:03:53,326 --> 00:03:54,570
Go, Randy, run!

55
00:03:54,570 --> 00:03:55,954
Gotta get out.

56
00:03:58,270 --> 00:04:00,055
Michaels? Harrison? Anybody?

57
00:04:01,219 --> 00:04:04,277
Nothing. L-Sat is down and no answer at RCU.

58
00:04:04,277 --> 00:04:06,233
Whatever's going on out there is huge.

59
00:04:06,504 --> 00:04:07,988
Aw, all right, just let me get this straight.

60
00:04:08,199 --> 00:04:12,010
The head of homeland security ordered you to fly us, five kids,

61
00:04:12,010 --> 00:04:15,489
to Peru, but had you land way up in Andes moutains of Peru,

62
00:04:15,489 --> 00:04:18,979
so that other government people could meet us and somehow tell us

63
00:04:18,979 --> 00:04:23,031
how to go to the capital of Peru way over in Lima. And take down their government.

64
00:04:24,275 --> 00:04:25,528
Yes, that was the order.

65
00:04:26,581 --> 00:04:27,885
And that makes sense to you?

66
00:04:28,587 --> 00:04:29,640
Nope, not at all.

67
00:04:30,292 --> 00:04:34,444
Actually the whole rounding up of the panflute bands didn't make sense any of us either.

68
00:04:34,594 --> 00:04:36,991
None of what that homeland security guy does makes sense.

69
00:04:36,991 --> 00:04:38,595
So could you just fly us home, please?

70
00:04:39,388 --> 00:04:43,359
You don't understand. The plan was to have refuelling truck meet us here.

71
00:04:43,359 --> 00:04:45,796
We don't have enough gas to fly anyplace.

72
00:04:46,388 --> 00:04:47,591
Aw, that's awesome.

73
00:04:48,283 --> 00:04:50,138
So, we've got to find another way out of here.

74
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:52,138
It's starting to look that way, young.

75
00:04:56,637 --> 00:05:00,488
This is fun. Let's walk for miles through a spooky jungle.

76
00:05:00,488 --> 00:05:02,604
It just keeps getting better and better.

77
00:05:02,845 --> 00:05:04,780
You know, we're getting pretty sick of your attitude, Craig.

78
00:05:04,911 --> 00:05:05,663
[mumbles]

79
00:05:05,663 --> 00:05:07,929
Nobody likes hanging out with people who complain all the time.

80
00:05:08,641 --> 00:05:10,717
Look at that, no lights on, nothing.

81
00:05:11,179 --> 00:05:14,187
It's like humans have never been to this part of Peru.

82
00:05:28,107 --> 00:05:31,206
More guinea pigs seem to be moving in from all directions.

83
00:05:31,206 --> 00:05:36,681
We checked on wikipedia and found out that guinea pigs are from Andes mountains, here.

84
00:05:36,681 --> 00:05:40,212
What about the panflute bands? Are they on their way to the Guantanamo bay?

85
00:05:42,137 --> 00:05:46,219
Sir, we believe we have bigger problems right now than panflute bands.

86
00:05:46,369 --> 00:05:48,345
Have they been loaded on to the boats or not?

87
00:05:48,936 --> 00:05:54,312
No, sir. We diverted all the resources away from the panflute bands to deal with the guinea pigs.

88
00:05:54,362 --> 00:05:59,246
That wasn't order. The flute bands were to be put on boats to Guantanamo last night.

89
00:05:59,246 --> 00:06:03,809
I'm still in charge here! I want those panflute bands on the boats to Guantanamo!

90
00:06:04,822 --> 00:06:08,432
Yes, sir. I don't see why you have to yell at people.

91
00:06:18,391 --> 00:06:19,825
Where do we go, Randy?

92
00:06:19,825 --> 00:06:22,432
We've got to get out of town. Go through that way.

93
00:06:28,359 --> 00:06:30,997
- Oh, Jesus!
- Randy, run.

94
00:06:33,424 --> 00:06:35,128
Okay. We're running now.

95
00:06:36,252 --> 00:06:38,919
There's Sharon and Shelley running. Wave to the camera, Shelley.

96
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:39,972
Dad!

97
00:06:44,816 --> 00:06:46,290
In there, in there!

98
00:06:50,633 --> 00:06:53,982
Oh god, oh god, I'm so startled. Are you startled, Sharon?

99
00:06:53,982 --> 00:06:55,186
Randy! Put down...

100
00:06:58,244 --> 00:07:00,060
It's gonna kill us.

101
00:07:00,932 --> 00:07:03,520
Just stay down, Shelley. It can't come in here.

102
00:07:05,034 --> 00:07:07,391
Hold on, hold on, I need to get a shot of it from outside.

103
00:07:07,872 --> 00:07:10,148
Randy? Were are you going?

104
00:07:13,819 --> 00:07:16,246
They look so good from outside the bus.

105
00:07:16,246 --> 00:07:17,128
Randy!

106
00:07:22,263 --> 00:07:23,747
What the hell are you doing?

107
00:07:24,118 --> 00:07:25,964
I've got really good shot of it, Sharon.

108
00:07:31,028 --> 00:07:35,170
I don't know, Lensky. This entire area of Peru isn't even charted on the maps.

109
00:07:35,170 --> 00:07:39,322
This whole walley is strange. Just look at the size of that fruit.

110
00:07:40,806 --> 00:07:44,747
Ain't that a peach? And how do you like them apples.

111
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:50,293
Take a look at this.

112
00:07:52,179 --> 00:07:55,408
They look like... bee hive combs.

113
00:07:55,939 --> 00:07:57,408
Oh my god.

114
00:07:59,830 --> 00:08:01,204
Dude, what is this place?

115
00:08:01,295 --> 00:08:06,429
It's like an unknown walley that time forgot, where everything grows huge.

116
00:08:07,482 --> 00:08:12,747
That's a shock. I decided to follow you guys and now I'm in land of giants lost world.

117
00:08:13,540 --> 00:08:18,323
Craig, it isn't our fault. You make it sound like we was wanna be in situation like this, we don't have any choice.

118
00:08:18,323 --> 00:08:19,968
Yeah, stuff just happens.

119
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:21,968
Stuff just happens.

120
00:08:22,124 --> 00:08:23,047
That's right.

121
00:08:23,739 --> 00:08:27,489
You just winded up being set by the government to take down the city of Lima

122
00:08:27,489 --> 00:08:30,087
only to wind up at land of giants lost world.

123
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:32,087
That's right.

124
00:08:32,885 --> 00:08:36,505
You know what stuff happens to most kids? They fall off their bikes.

125
00:08:36,806 --> 00:08:41,449
They get in fights with their parents. They get sweddled out their birthday money.

126
00:08:41,449 --> 00:08:44,287
Look, wherever we are I think we better keep moving.

127
00:08:46,012 --> 00:08:47,085
[mumbles]

128
00:08:56,944 --> 00:09:01,106
All right, all right, here's Sharon and Shelley on the roof of BestBuy.

129
00:09:01,396 --> 00:09:03,773
We... we ran up here to get off the streets.

130
00:09:03,773 --> 00:09:06,802
We found the Stotch family hiding up here also.

131
00:09:06,982 --> 00:09:09,700
There's Chris and Linda, their son Butters.

132
00:09:10,051 --> 00:09:10,883
Hello.

133
00:09:13,421 --> 00:09:15,978
What is that? Chris, what is that?

134
00:09:15,978 --> 00:09:17,532
That's... that's a new sound.

135
00:09:18,365 --> 00:09:19,929
Oh god, look!

136
00:09:19,929 --> 00:09:21,414
Those aren't guinea pigs.

137
00:09:21,775 --> 00:09:22,888
Get off the roof.

138
00:09:23,259 --> 00:09:24,888
Go, go, go, go.

139
00:09:31,904 --> 00:09:34,972
We are now getting a report of giant bees.

140
00:09:34,972 --> 00:09:37,830
The giant bees have been seen at the US and Europe.

141
00:09:40,007 --> 00:09:42,103
Get away, there's bees everywhere.

142
00:09:48,932 --> 00:09:50,597
There's another one right there.

143
00:09:52,452 --> 00:09:54,027
Oh my god!

144
00:10:03,474 --> 00:10:06,653
It stung me, it stung me.

145
00:10:11,497 --> 00:10:15,197
Wow, that's startled me, that's really startling.

146
00:10:16,912 --> 00:10:19,159
I think we're just heading deeper into the mountains.

147
00:10:19,730 --> 00:10:21,575
Yeah, maybe we should start heading that way.

148
00:10:21,846 --> 00:10:23,100
[mumbles]

149
00:10:23,762 --> 00:10:25,100
Hey, have a look at this.

150
00:10:30,411 --> 00:10:31,474
What is it?

151
00:10:31,634 --> 00:10:33,610
I don't know. Looks old.

152
00:10:34,212 --> 00:10:35,234
Let's see what's in there.

153
00:10:35,585 --> 00:10:36,869
Let's see what's in there.

154
00:10:37,792 --> 00:10:39,978
That's why you guys get into this situations.

155
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:44,260
Because when you come across a spooky ancient ruine, you say

156
00:10:44,712 --> 00:10:46,136
Let's see what's in there

157
00:10:47,409 --> 00:10:48,793
It might be way out, Craig.

158
00:10:48,793 --> 00:10:50,267
Yeah, mr. Complainy Pants.

159
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:55,703
Wow!

160
00:10:56,064 --> 00:10:58,892
I don't think anybody's been here for centuries.

161
00:11:00,276 --> 00:11:01,459
[mumbles]

162
00:11:01,459 --> 00:11:06,213
You guys, look at this. It's a wall of ancient drawings.

163
00:11:06,664 --> 00:11:09,252
Dude, it's a peruvian flute band.

164
00:11:09,252 --> 00:11:15,159
I know, and look. Looks like the panflute music is driving away giant guinea pigs.

165
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:20,865
Oh, no way, look. The panflute bands put in prison. Just like what's happened.

166
00:11:21,818 --> 00:11:23,623
And then the guinea pigs killing people.

167
00:11:23,623 --> 00:11:24,866
And then...

168
00:11:30,031 --> 00:11:31,997
Dude, it's Craig!

169
00:11:32,007 --> 00:11:32,618
What?

170
00:11:33,371 --> 00:11:34,618
That is Craig.

171
00:11:41,183 --> 00:11:42,527
Dude, Craig, what's going on?

172
00:11:43,179 --> 00:11:44,527
I've no idea.

173
00:11:44,527 --> 00:11:47,902
Well, do you mind telling us what you doing on ancient incan wall, Craig?

174
00:11:48,654 --> 00:11:49,902
I don't know.

175
00:11:52,004 --> 00:11:55,805
There's now word of huge bee hives forming in cities across the US and Canada.

176
00:11:55,805 --> 00:12:00,398
Europe and China are reporting deaths by guinea pigs in the tens of thousands.

177
00:12:00,398 --> 00:12:03,767
And how are the efforts to contain all this going?

178
00:12:03,767 --> 00:12:08,952
It's bad, sir. It seems we have no way of stopping it. We've lost complete control.

179
00:12:13,465 --> 00:12:14,628
Uh, sir?

180
00:12:15,170 --> 00:12:17,316
I'm sorry, I just thought of a funny joke.

181
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:22,671
All right, get the jets ready. I need to get to Machu Picchu.

182
00:12:22,671 --> 00:12:24,671
Machu Picchu, sir?

183
00:12:24,671 --> 00:12:27,616
Yes, I need to be taken to Machu Picchu, have you lost your hearing?

184
00:12:28,037 --> 00:12:30,915
But sir, what could possibly be at Machu Picchu to help...

185
00:12:30,915 --> 00:12:32,469
Am I in charge or not?!

186
00:12:36,661 --> 00:12:40,272
We're in grocery store now. Some other survivors here.

187
00:12:41,014 --> 00:12:42,769
Can we get out through the highway?

188
00:12:42,769 --> 00:12:45,487
Highway's unreachable. There's guinea rats all over it.

189
00:12:45,487 --> 00:12:48,957
Guinea rats? What do you mean guinea rats?

190
00:12:48,957 --> 00:12:52,878
Look, there are guinea pigs but there's also guinea bees, guinea rats.

191
00:12:52,878 --> 00:12:54,994
I've even seen some guinea spiders out there.

192
00:12:55,485 --> 00:12:57,170
Randy, will you stop doing that?

193
00:13:00,078 --> 00:13:02,606
Look, I thing we need to find the way out under the city.

194
00:13:02,696 --> 00:13:05,083
In the sewers? It can't be safe down there.

195
00:13:07,189 --> 00:13:09,174
Oh god, what are we gonna dooo?

196
00:13:10,869 --> 00:13:12,755
Something's inside the store.

197
00:13:13,838 --> 00:13:16,004
Guinea rabbits, they're inside!

198
00:13:21,349 --> 00:13:24,057
Argh, they're everywhere... Help me!..

199
00:13:27,126 --> 00:13:29,603
No! Travis, no!

200
00:13:31,939 --> 00:13:33,373
Thare's something over there.

201
00:13:34,116 --> 00:13:37,626
- It's a guinea bear.
- No, it's a guinea mouse, stupid!

202
00:13:41,487 --> 00:13:44,164
Randy, the store room, we gotta get to the store room.

203
00:13:51,876 --> 00:13:53,541
Mom, I can't see.

204
00:13:53,541 --> 00:13:55,998
It's ok, Shelley. Daddy's gonna turn on night vision.

205
00:13:57,202 --> 00:13:59,558
There... there. Okay.

206
00:14:00,752 --> 00:14:01,674
AAAA

207
00:14:02,316 --> 00:14:05,024
- What, what, what, what?
- Nothing, sorry, I just startled myself.

208
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:08,404
AAAA!!!

209
00:14:10,861 --> 00:14:12,485
Let's head over this way guys.

210
00:14:13,358 --> 00:14:15,524
- You hear that?
- It sounds like water.

211
00:14:15,524 --> 00:14:16,878
Yeah, it's coming from up there.

212
00:14:20,067 --> 00:14:21,471
Wow!

213
00:14:27,598 --> 00:14:29,123
Dude, that's awesome.

214
00:14:29,123 --> 00:14:30,045
All right, let's go.

215
00:14:30,717 --> 00:14:31,740
No.

216
00:14:32,412 --> 00:14:33,740
Wha... what do you mean no?

217
00:14:34,448 --> 00:14:36,544
I'm not following you guys anymore.

218
00:14:37,938 --> 00:14:39,352
Dude, we have to get check this out.

219
00:14:40,084 --> 00:14:40,706
Why?

220
00:14:42,752 --> 00:14:44,717
'Cause just... That's just the way it is.

221
00:14:45,088 --> 00:14:48,689
Everytime bad thing happens you guys end up putting yourselves

222
00:14:48,689 --> 00:14:52,269
deeper into the middle of it because "That's just the way it is".

223
00:14:53,021 --> 00:14:56,340
Hey, we aren't the ones on an ancient temple prophecy wall, buttwipe.

224
00:14:56,872 --> 00:14:59,770
I don't care. I've decided that I'm done.

225
00:15:00,101 --> 00:15:02,528
I'm choosing not to be a part of this anymore.

226
00:15:03,541 --> 00:15:05,136
How would you do that?

227
00:15:05,336 --> 00:15:07,011
It's easy, watch.

228
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,475
Craig, dude, wait up.

229
00:15:22,716 --> 00:15:25,885
- Dude, Craig, we should go back now.
- No.

230
00:15:29,876 --> 00:15:32,454
- Hey, look, there's something here.
- Nope.

231
00:15:38,190 --> 00:15:40,868
Dude, this is boring, this is just a bunch of walking around.

232
00:15:41,610 --> 00:15:44,598
Yep. Nice and boring. Just the way I like it.

233
00:15:48,389 --> 00:15:52,110
It's been three days now since the guinea pigs and the guinea bees attacked.

234
00:15:52,441 --> 00:15:55,911
Guinea rabbits are still everywhere along with few guinea panthers.

235
00:15:56,583 --> 00:15:58,939
We've taken shelter at the outback stakehouse.

236
00:15:59,090 --> 00:16:01,717
There's Sharon and Shelley. Say "Hey", guys.

237
00:16:04,255 --> 00:16:06,230
What is that, what is that?

238
00:16:06,230 --> 00:16:09,299
I'm... I'm gonna take a look outside. What is it?

239
00:16:09,299 --> 00:16:11,535
It's a guineasaurus rex.

240
00:16:19,528 --> 00:16:22,005
- Oh my god!
- Oh no, I'm way too startled.

241
00:16:22,005 --> 00:16:22,958
Look!

242
00:16:28,494 --> 00:16:30,399
Jesus, they can't kill it.

243
00:16:31,733 --> 00:16:34,260
What do you think about the guineasaurus rex, Shelley?

244
00:16:37,399 --> 00:16:40,689
Oh, that's good. There's Shelley with the guineasaurus rex in the background.

245
00:16:41,150 --> 00:16:43,637
Don't get a ... Shelley.

246
00:16:43,637 --> 00:16:46,866
Oh, I know, hold on your palm so it looks like you're holding the guineasaurus rex.

247
00:16:47,468 --> 00:16:48,371
Shelley...

248
00:16:48,371 --> 00:16:50,948
Randy! I have had it!

249
00:16:50,948 --> 00:16:53,706
You are putting down that goddamn camera!

250
00:16:53,876 --> 00:16:56,975
Sharon, you gonna be really glad we have all this footage of the family some day.

251
00:17:04,065 --> 00:17:05,299
Wait here a minute.

252
00:17:11,146 --> 00:17:15,819
Behold! I am standing on your precious land.

253
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,988
I've waited a long time for this.

254
00:17:26,379 --> 00:17:27,332
What's he doing?

255
00:17:27,813 --> 00:17:31,574
What are your prophecy now? Nothing can stop me.

256
00:17:36,067 --> 00:17:37,441
Craig!

257
00:17:38,343 --> 00:17:40,269
No! How did you get here?

258
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:43,849
Hey, it's that asshole who sent us to the jungle with nobody to pick us up.

259
00:17:43,849 --> 00:17:46,306
Sir, is everything all right?

260
00:17:46,306 --> 00:17:48,522
- Shoot them.
- Shoot them?

261
00:17:48,522 --> 00:17:52,073
They're a peruvian band that escaped. We must keep them contained.

262
00:17:52,073 --> 00:17:53,457
No, no, listen to me.

263
00:17:53,457 --> 00:17:55,994
The peruvian flute bands were keeping the guinea creatures away.

264
00:17:55,994 --> 00:17:58,050
Whatever's happening to the world is happening because

265
00:17:58,050 --> 00:17:59,534
you guys got rid of all the panflute bands.

266
00:17:59,955 --> 00:18:01,199
I've said, shoot them!

267
00:18:01,319 --> 00:18:04,116
Go look, it's all an ancient incan prophecy.

268
00:18:04,558 --> 00:18:06,416
Maybe we should look at it, sir.

269
00:18:06,416 --> 00:18:08,416
Damn you, Craig.

270
00:18:08,416 --> 00:18:10,736
You just don't ever stop, do you?

271
00:18:11,789 --> 00:18:13,333
I didn't say anything.

272
00:18:12,571 --> 00:18:17,706
You see, for thousands of years hoard creatures have lived in the guinea valley of Peru.

273
00:18:17,706 --> 00:18:20,864
The Incas learned how to keep the creatures at bay.

274
00:18:20,864 --> 00:18:25,909
By playing panflute music. Guinea creatures hated even more than humans do.

275
00:18:26,140 --> 00:18:28,968
But the prophecy foretold that one day the creatures

276
00:18:28,968 --> 00:18:31,856
would be unleashed and I have made that happen.

277
00:18:32,177 --> 00:18:34,684
Incas predicted the world would be saved...

278
00:18:35,256 --> 00:18:36,349
by Craig.

279
00:18:36,861 --> 00:18:39,979
But that part of the prophecy will not come true.

280
00:18:39,979 --> 00:18:42,577
For you alone. Die on this mountain.

281
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:48,775
You... you some kind of monster.

282
00:18:49,256 --> 00:18:51,081
Oh, I'm much more than that.

283
00:18:51,462 --> 00:18:54,702
Guinea bees, guinea rabbits, guineasaurus rexes...

284
00:18:54,802 --> 00:18:57,429
I'm something much more evil.

285
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:05,282
Guinea pirate!

286
00:19:05,703 --> 00:19:07,282
Jesus Christ!

287
00:19:07,282 --> 00:19:11,619
Sir, I promise you, I'm not going to ruin your plan.

288
00:19:11,619 --> 00:19:13,967
I'll just walk away. See?

289
00:19:28,749 --> 00:19:31,799
Okay, now there's sparks shooting out of my eyes.

290
00:19:32,209 --> 00:19:34,656
Argh, curse you, Craig.

291
00:19:51,444 --> 00:19:52,888
My name is Craig Tucker.

292
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:57,391
Last week I stopped a guinea pirate from taking over the Earth.

293
00:19:58,584 --> 00:20:01,362
All the peruvian flute bands were released.

294
00:20:01,703 --> 00:20:05,684
And drowe the guinea creatures to the Andes mountains.

295
00:20:08,151 --> 00:20:11,170
Many people had died but mankind had prevailed.

296
00:20:12,554 --> 00:20:15,312
All over the world survivors were found.

297
00:20:15,563 --> 00:20:18,391
Living witnesses to the terror that had been seen.

298
00:20:19,053 --> 00:20:22,462
You here, look, look. What the...

299
00:20:22,462 --> 00:20:24,729
Oh, didn't have a tape in it.

300
00:20:26,283 --> 00:20:31,498
The guinea pirate lived but was taken to prison to live out the rest of his days.

301
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:37,455
And people all over the world learned to support their local peruvian flute bands.

302
00:20:37,455 --> 00:20:39,455
And buy their CDs.

303
00:20:39,772 --> 00:20:41,928
For they protect us from the guinea creatures.

304
00:20:43,382 --> 00:20:47,083
As for me I was returned home by the homeland security.

305
00:20:47,083 --> 00:20:49,319
My parents were so happy.

306
00:20:50,392 --> 00:20:54,263
I realized that we don't always have control over what happens to us.

307
00:20:54,263 --> 00:20:56,650
We are but players on the stage of life.

308
00:20:57,643 --> 00:21:01,875
And I also learned to never listen to people come asking you for money.

309
00:21:06,067 --> 00:21:07,381
That guy's an asshole.

310
00:21:07,481 --> 00:21:08,674
Yeah, what a dick!

311
00:21:08,795 --> 00:21:10,179
[mumbles]

312
00:21:15,965 --> 00:21:18,011
Sir, sir, we have a problem.

313
00:21:18,111 --> 00:21:19,154
What now?

314
00:21:19,535 --> 00:21:23,477
The former director of homeland security that turned to be a guinea pig,

315
00:21:23,828 --> 00:21:26,475
it attacked the guards, got out of its holding cell.

316
00:21:28,010 --> 00:21:29,534
My god, you telling me...

317
00:21:29,734 --> 00:21:32,432
Yes sir, it broke out of prison...
