4
00:00:34,930 --> 00:00:39,460
It's like my whole life has just
been one big screw up, you know?

5
00:00:39,470 --> 00:00:42,770
I admit it, I was sexually lost.

6
00:00:43,060 --> 00:00:45,420
And then I see this person on oprah.

7
00:00:45,430 --> 00:00:47,920
She's a woman, but then she got
a sex change and became a man,

8
00:00:47,930 --> 00:00:52,650
but then she got pregnant and is having a baby
which means she was still a woman all along.

9
00:00:52,670 --> 00:00:55,170
That means I'm really still a man!

10
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:57,870
I still feel like a man.

11
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:00,400
Butters: Are we gonna
get tested on this?

12
00:01:00,410 --> 00:01:03,930
This sex change was a big mistake. Okay?

13
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:08,860
I was on a lot of pain killers at the
time, and I thought it was what I wanted.

14
00:01:08,870 --> 00:01:10,890
Stan: Dude, you wanna
do some math problems?

15
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:13,290
And then I go to the doctor, right?

16
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:16,370
And I say doctor, I want to go
back to being a man and he says,

17
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:19,590
well, there's been too much
damage, you can't go back.

18
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:21,760
Where are you going to find a penis?

19
00:01:21,770 --> 00:01:24,460
What do you mean where
am i gonna find a penis!

20
00:01:24,470 --> 00:01:25,960
I'm a man!

21
00:01:25,970 --> 00:01:28,410
I deserve a god dammed penis!

22
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:34,880
Uh, mister --
mister garrison!

23
00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:38,170
Could we speak with you, please?

24
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:40,400
What do you want? I'm trying to teach.

25
00:01:40,410 --> 00:01:45,210
Uh, we think it's best you not teach until
you get your personal life in order, mkay.

26
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:49,900
Oh, it's so easy for you,
mackey, you have a penis!

27
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:54,780
Okay, students, uh, obviously we've had
a little emergency with your teacher.

28
00:01:54,800 --> 00:02:00,230
So, uh, while we deal with this we need one of you
to lead the class and review for tomorrow's quiz.

29
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:03,160
Me, me! Me!Me!

30
00:02:03,170 --> 00:02:04,610
Right here! Right here!

31
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:07,490
who else would like to
be teacher for the day?

32
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:09,410
Anybody else?

33
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:13,540
Principal victoria! Over here!

34
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:16,340
Any other volunteers perhaps?

35
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:19,720
Principal victoria!

36
00:02:19,730 --> 00:02:22,390
Alright, alright, fine.
Eric, you lead the class.

37
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:23,470
Yes!

38
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:26,190
Now just lead a review over whatever
mr. Garrison's been teaching you

39
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:29,430
and I'll be back to
check on your shortly.

40
00:02:31,850 --> 00:02:34,340
Well, well, well...

41
00:02:34,350 --> 00:02:36,900
who's teacher now?

42
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:39,750
Yeah... who's teacher?

43
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,650
You're not the teacher, fat ass.

44
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:43,510
That's mister cartman now, kyle!

45
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:47,740
And you will be wise to not interrupt
my class unless you want to be suspended!

46
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:52,380
Yeah. You like that.

47
00:02:53,690 --> 00:02:57,080
Alright, clyde, you're
first. Get up here.

48
00:02:57,090 --> 00:02:59,890
Yeah, you're gonna take it, clyde.

49
00:03:04,910 --> 00:03:10,760
So it appears that the local farmer's
market could be soon facing complete closure.

50
00:03:10,770 --> 00:03:14,740
In other news tonight, a south park
bio company is coming under fire

51
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:19,050
for genetically engineering
body parts onto laboratory mice.

52
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:23,140
This picture of a mouse genetically
altered to grow a human ear

53
00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:26,170
has already sparked waves of protest.

54
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:27,470
What?

55
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:30,700
But the scientists say the process
could help thousands of people

56
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:34,520
who have become disfigured
and need ears or noses.

57
00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:36,920
Holy freakin' jesus.

58
00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:39,270
RESERCH GROUP LABORTORIES

59
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:41,860
Using common genetics
and cartilage scaffolding,

60
00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:45,640
we can graft almost any body part
onto a mouse and allow it to develop.

61
00:03:45,650 --> 00:03:47,960
Here's the mouse you saw on television.

62
00:03:47,970 --> 00:03:51,710
Once the ear fully forms, it can
be transplanted onto a person.

63
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:54,640
Doctor, what about a penis?

64
00:03:54,650 --> 00:03:58,580
Well, a penis is something a
man puts into a woman's vagina.

65
00:03:58,600 --> 00:03:59,380
No, no.

66
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:03,320
If I gave you some of my dna, could
you grow a penis on a mouse for me?

67
00:04:03,330 --> 00:04:07,950
You don't understand, doing this stuff is very
expensive and we've never tried a penis before.

68
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:09,640
There's no guarantee it would work!

69
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:13,250
I will give you all the money
I have to just try. Please.

70
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:15,810
Doctor, I'm a man
trapped in a woman's body.

71
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:17,260
I need a penis.

72
00:04:17,270 --> 00:04:20,910
Alright, alright, let's
see what we can do.

73
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:25,660
Eric, we've called you in to commend
you for your role as student teacher.

74
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:29,370
Don't commend me, it's the
students fault for being so stupid!

75
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:32,400
Commend means you've done
a great job, eric, mkay.

76
00:04:32,410 --> 00:04:34,310
After leading your class through review,

77
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:37,930
your schoolmates scored higher
than they ever have on their tests!

78
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:40,660
Whatever you did really worked on them!

79
00:04:40,670 --> 00:04:42,100
Oh well, thank you.

80
00:04:42,110 --> 00:04:46,340
I believe strict discipline along with compassion
for my students is catamite to their learning.

81
00:04:46,350 --> 00:04:50,340
These gentlemen from the denver county school
board have something they want to ask you.

82
00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:54,470
Young man, word of your success as a student
teacher has started the whole board thinking.

83
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:58,170
We would like you to try your methods
on one of our inner city school classes.

84
00:04:58,190 --> 00:05:00,730
These kids just won't
listen to any adult teachers,

85
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:05,480
and since you handled your class so
well, how'd you like to give it a shot?

86
00:05:05,490 --> 00:05:09,210
That sounds like a chance to really make
an impact on some students who need it most.

87
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:11,420
How much will you pay me?

88
00:05:12,990 --> 00:05:14,290
Three hundred bucks!

89
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:15,810
Did you hear what I said you guys!

90
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:19,170
My awesome teaching skills is
gonna earn me three hundred bucks!

91
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:20,970
You're not an awesome teacher!

92
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:24,100
Whatever, the whole class
scored super high on the tests.

93
00:05:24,110 --> 00:05:25,460
The only reason we scored high was

94
00:05:25,470 --> 00:05:28,380
because we took the answers out of
garrison's desk, and you know it!

95
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:31,810
Yes, but whose idea was it to take
the answers out of garrison's desk?

96
00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:33,050
Kenny's!

97
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:34,390
Yeah, that was my idea.

98
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:35,090
Oh, yeah.

99
00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:37,810
But whatever, I'm gonna go teach those
underprivileged inner city students

100
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:39,900
and really turn their lives around.

101
00:05:39,910 --> 00:05:42,100
Do you know what those
kids are going to do to you?

102
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:44,650
A little middle class white
boy telling them what to do?

103
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:48,120
They are going to murder you.

104
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:53,160
Maybe he's right.

105
00:05:53,170 --> 00:05:55,810
I better be careful how I look.

106
00:06:21,710 --> 00:06:25,330
Students, quiet! Quiet, please!

107
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,440
Give me your attention.

108
00:06:29,450 --> 00:06:33,490
I'll give you my attention
all night long, mrs. Miller!

109
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:36,830
You're on thin ice, rodriguez!

110
00:06:36,850 --> 00:06:37,950
Now listen up.

111
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:42,720
The denver county school board has
sent over a special guest teacher.

112
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:47,880
This may be your last shot at
graduating from high school at all!

113
00:06:47,890 --> 00:06:52,150
I want you to welcome
-- eric cartmanez.

114
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:56,110
Hello, students.

115
00:06:56,120 --> 00:07:00,270
I am eric cartmanez, your new teacher.

116
00:07:02,190 --> 00:07:03,640
What the hell is this?

117
00:07:03,650 --> 00:07:07,770
I am here to teach you calculus.

118
00:07:10,990 --> 00:07:14,130
I think you're going to be very
pleased with the progress, ms. Garrison.

119
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:15,480
Mister garrison!

120
00:07:15,490 --> 00:07:17,440
Sorry, 'mister' garrison.

121
00:07:17,450 --> 00:07:21,890
Your dna has replicated and grafted
very successfully with the mouse.

122
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:26,450
And so here's your penis.

123
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:29,850
Wow, my penis looks great!

124
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:31,960
Yes, it's a fantastic penis.

125
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:33,640
Congratulations.

126
00:07:33,650 --> 00:07:35,280
How long before it's ready?

127
00:07:35,290 --> 00:07:38,660
Well, it still has some
forming to do, but fairly soon.

128
00:07:38,670 --> 00:07:40,800
Lemme see if it feels right in my hand.

129
00:07:40,810 --> 00:07:42,820
No! Don't
open the --

130
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:44,520
Oh, no!

131
00:07:46,350 --> 00:07:48,840
Don't let it get out the lab.

132
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:52,590
My penis!

133
00:07:55,190 --> 00:07:58,360
Stop penis! Come back here!

134
00:07:58,730 --> 00:08:03,370
Okay, everyone take a silly bus
and pass it to the amigo behind you.

135
00:08:03,380 --> 00:08:05,450
Hey man, what the hell
do you think you're doing?

136
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:06,860
Yeah!

137
00:08:06,870 --> 00:08:09,980
Mr. Cartmanez is here to make
sure you all get into college.

138
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:10,930
Get into college?

139
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:13,330
Man, we aren't getting
into no college? F you!

140
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:14,680
- Yeah, man!
- That's right!

141
00:08:14,690 --> 00:08:17,640
- What is this, anyway?
- Man, this is crap!

142
00:08:17,650 --> 00:08:21,240
How do I reeech these keeeds?

143
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:26,540
The reason that you think you can't get into
college is because you haven't been taught --

144
00:08:26,550 --> 00:08:28,360
how to cheat properly.

145
00:08:28,370 --> 00:08:31,030
How do you think white
people always get ahead?

146
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:32,640
Because we cheat
all the time --

147
00:08:32,650 --> 00:08:36,600
I mean because they cheat all the time.

148
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:39,370
This is bill beeelichick.

149
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:41,160
Coach of the new england patriots.

150
00:08:41,170 --> 00:08:43,550
He's won three superbowls. How?

151
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:45,340
He cheated.

152
00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:48,370
He even got caught
cheating. And nobody cared.

153
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:51,390
Bill beelicheck proved that
in america it's ok to cheat,

154
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:54,230
as long as you cheat
your way to the top.

155
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:56,490
Hey, I don't want to
be called a cheater.

156
00:08:56,500 --> 00:09:00,070
No, no, if you cheat and
fail, you're a cheater.

157
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:03,770
If you cheat and
succeed, you're savvyyyy.

158
00:09:03,780 --> 00:09:05,250
This is bull!

159
00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:07,940
I don't want to waste my
time learning to cheat!

160
00:09:07,950 --> 00:09:08,960
Go ahead, the door's right there.

161
00:09:08,970 --> 00:09:12,560
Bye, bye, have fun, we will miss you.

162
00:09:14,930 --> 00:09:17,950
How do I reach these kids?

163
00:09:21,350 --> 00:09:22,620
Boys!

164
00:09:22,630 --> 00:09:25,610
Boys, have you seen my penis?

165
00:09:27,110 --> 00:09:28,000
What?

166
00:09:28,010 --> 00:09:29,680
My penis is on the loose!

167
00:09:29,690 --> 00:09:33,000
If you see it, just try to
catch it with some cheese!

168
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:37,930
Ow, that hurt my brains.

169
00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:50,230
Nice form, compadre.

170
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:52,820
Hey I walked out of your class, teacher.

171
00:09:52,830 --> 00:09:55,530
Look, I don't want to argue with
you about the merits of cheating.

172
00:09:55,540 --> 00:09:57,630
Who wants to argue on
a nice day like theeees.

173
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:59,600
How about a little pickup game?

174
00:10:00,070 --> 00:10:01,470
Hey, petano!

175
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:02,850
Can you keep score for us?

176
00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:05,080
Sure thing, mr. C.

177
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:07,870
Okay, you start on defense, amigo.

178
00:10:15,010 --> 00:10:17,260
Oho, that's one to nonothing, amigo.

179
00:10:17,270 --> 00:10:18,570
You cheated!

180
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:20,090
What's the score, effe?

181
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:22,260
Okay, let's go. Your turn.

182
00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:30,340
That's two to noteeeng, amigo.

183
00:10:30,350 --> 00:10:32,670
F you, man! You can't do that!

184
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:35,560
Look at the scoreboard, amigo.

185
00:10:35,570 --> 00:10:41,420
No matter how many times you say I cheated, the scoreboard says 2
- 0.

186
00:10:41,430 --> 00:10:45,470
I know what you're trying to say,
but I still don't agree with it.

187
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:48,460
Two to nothing, essa.

188
00:10:48,470 --> 00:10:50,620
Two to nothing.

189
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:54,560
Hoh, how do I reach these keedz?

190
00:11:00,610 --> 00:11:02,720
What is that?

191
00:11:12,330 --> 00:11:14,460
Stephen! Stephen, come quick!

192
00:11:14,470 --> 00:11:15,660
What is it, dear?

193
00:11:15,670 --> 00:11:18,270
A penis is loose in our kitchen!

194
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:19,200
A penis?

195
00:11:19,210 --> 00:11:21,640
Yes, it just ran across the floor!

196
00:11:21,650 --> 00:11:23,610
Now darling, calm down.

197
00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:27,310
Calm down nothing, I don't want
that penis running through my house!

198
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:30,770
Ah, women, always afraid of penises.

199
00:11:34,310 --> 00:11:35,320
There! There you see it!

200
00:11:35,330 --> 00:11:37,610
Oh, it's just a little penis, darling.

201
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:41,220
I don't care, it's probably
got all kinds of diseases.

202
00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:44,180
Butters: Hey, wait! I think
that's teacher's penis!

203
00:11:44,190 --> 00:11:45,410
Your teacher's penis?

204
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:46,960
Butters: Yeah, that must be his!

205
00:11:46,970 --> 00:11:50,930
Butters, how do you know what
your teacher's penis looks like?

206
00:11:53,370 --> 00:11:56,170
Today, we will discuss one of the
most fundamental ways to cheat --

207
00:11:56,180 --> 00:11:58,410
getting test material ahead of time.

208
00:11:58,420 --> 00:12:01,350
When bill belichick cheated for
the patriots, what did he do?

209
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:04,470
He videotaped the
opposing team's defense.

210
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:06,750
Think of the defense as your test.

211
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:10,810
When taking a test you must
also 'videotape the defense.

212
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:15,670
Learn what's on the test before they
give it to you, and that way you can --

213
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:21,990
I thought that, well, maybe
I could give cheating a try.

214
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:23,730
Have a seat, amigo.

215
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:26,090
Good to have you back.

216
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:26,760
Alright.

217
00:12:26,770 --> 00:12:30,710
Now, when bill belichick got caught
with his camera, he did not panic.

218
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:33,410
He simply said what every good
white cheater says when caught:

219
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:36,360
I misinterpreted the rules.

220
00:12:36,370 --> 00:12:38,320
It's what you must also
say when caught cheating.

221
00:12:38,330 --> 00:12:40,240
"I misinterpreted the rules."

222
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:42,910
Say it with me "i
misinterpreted the rules."

223
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:43,820
Good! Again!

224
00:12:43,830 --> 00:12:46,420
I misinterpreted the rules! Again!

225
00:12:46,430 --> 00:12:48,670
I misinterpreted the rules!

226
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:50,180
Now you sound like white people!

227
00:12:50,190 --> 00:12:53,050
I misinterpreted the rules!

228
00:12:53,060 --> 00:12:57,260
What the hell do you mean
you just put my penis outside?

229
00:12:57,270 --> 00:12:58,610
Why didn't you call me?

230
00:12:58,620 --> 00:13:02,530
Look, garrison, my wife didn't want a
penis in the house, I had to get it out!

231
00:13:02,540 --> 00:13:04,390
Well now how am I supposed to find it?

232
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:06,460
It could be anywhere!

233
00:13:08,770 --> 00:13:10,600
Holy crap!

234
00:13:12,780 --> 00:13:14,480
Carol, get down from there!

235
00:13:14,490 --> 00:13:17,550
No! Didn't you see that penis just now?

236
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:22,460
I'm sure that penis is way more
scared of you than you are of it!

237
00:13:22,470 --> 00:13:24,470
You saw a penis?

238
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:29,960
It's so big and disgusting!

239
00:13:35,410 --> 00:13:38,020
Come back here, penis!

240
00:13:39,020 --> 00:13:41,870
There you are! Got you!

241
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:46,590
*************

242
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:52,370
*******

243
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:56,580
The answer to number 27 is five.

244
00:13:56,590 --> 00:13:59,680
The answer to number 27 is five.

245
00:13:59,710 --> 00:14:02,530
The answer to number 28 is fourteen.

246
00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:05,460
The answer to number 28 is fourteen.

247
00:14:05,470 --> 00:14:07,340
Man, what's the point?

248
00:14:07,350 --> 00:14:09,490
What's the point of any of this?

249
00:14:12,290 --> 00:14:15,730
Alright, everyone review the section on
sportscasters forgiving the patriots for cheating

250
00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:18,400
and saying it was no big
deal, I'll be right back.

251
00:14:19,450 --> 00:14:22,410
Malita! Malita, hold on!

252
00:14:22,850 --> 00:14:24,090
You can't quit now?

253
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:25,720
Come on, what's wrong with you?

254
00:14:25,730 --> 00:14:28,060
There isn't any point to all this.

255
00:14:28,070 --> 00:14:30,290
I won't be going to college.

256
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:32,910
I'm pregnant, alright?

257
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:34,120
I just found out.

258
00:14:34,130 --> 00:14:36,980
And eduardo isn't going
to help me raise iT.

259
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:41,220
How do I reach these keeeds?

260
00:14:41,230 --> 00:14:43,290
Alright, let's go get you an abortion.

261
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:44,880
No, I'm catholic.

262
00:14:44,890 --> 00:14:47,210
I think abortion is wrong.

263
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:48,610
Abortion isn't wrong.

264
00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:51,400
What's the one thing
I've been teaching you?

265
00:14:51,410 --> 00:14:53,100
That cheating is good.

266
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:54,080
Yes!

267
00:14:54,090 --> 00:14:56,330
And abortion is the
ultimate form of cheating.

268
00:14:56,340 --> 00:14:58,670
You're cheating nature itself!

269
00:14:59,270 --> 00:15:01,380
Why do rich white
girls get ahead in life?

270
00:15:01,390 --> 00:15:03,730
Because they get abortions
when they're young.

271
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:07,700
They get pregnant, but they still want to
go to college so whatever, they just cheat.

272
00:15:07,710 --> 00:15:11,710
They cheat that little critter in their
belly right out of a chance at life.

273
00:15:12,010 --> 00:15:13,860
I don't know, mr. C.

274
00:15:13,870 --> 00:15:15,650
Mexicans are told not to cheat.

275
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:18,580
Don't cheat, you got pregnant
you have to raise the child,

276
00:15:18,590 --> 00:15:21,150
so then you have to raise a child while
the white girls get to go to college

277
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:24,200
and probably have a
bunch more abortions.

278
00:15:24,730 --> 00:15:30,810
It is at our most challenging times
that we must cheat our very hardest.

279
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:36,730
And the last time you saw
your penis was two days ago?

280
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:37,930
That's right.

281
00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:39,630
Long whiskers or short?

282
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:41,750
Short. And little fluffy ears.

283
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:43,740
Fluffy ears, ok.

284
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:44,750
Think you got it, mitch?

285
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:46,090
I think so, sir.

286
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:48,460
Is this pretty close?

287
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:53,130
No, no! Not like that!

288
00:15:53,140 --> 00:15:54,830
That's just silly.

289
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:58,250
Sir, we might want to get a unit down
to the italian restaurant on kentner.

290
00:15:58,260 --> 00:15:59,010
What is it?

291
00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:00,080
Call just came through.

292
00:16:00,090 --> 00:16:02,460
Seems a penis broke in and cheese.

293
00:16:02,470 --> 00:16:04,560
Well, come on!

294
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:12,890
What's the matter?

295
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:14,690
A penis!

296
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:16,260
A penis? Where?

297
00:16:16,270 --> 00:16:18,110
There it is!

298
00:16:24,270 --> 00:16:25,280
Where is it?

299
00:16:25,290 --> 00:16:26,970
Look there!

300
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:29,820
Come on!

301
00:16:29,830 --> 00:16:33,490
What's that a penis
doing in a my kitchen?

302
00:16:34,110 --> 00:16:36,850
Don't you dare kill my penis!

303
00:16:37,970 --> 00:16:40,260
Crap! We gotta go back around!

304
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:55,970
* Someone,somewhere *

305
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:59,910
* is loving me tonight *

306
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:03,100
* Looking at the same moon *

307
00:17:03,110 --> 00:17:06,810
* and seeing it so bright *

308
00:17:06,820 --> 00:17:10,050
* Someone, somewhere *

309
00:17:10,060 --> 00:17:13,460
* is feeling my despair *

310
00:17:14,020 --> 00:17:17,230
* and this same moon is
making them think,of that *

311
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:19,390
There it is!

312
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:25,410
No! No!

313
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:28,460
Nooo! Nooooo!

314
00:17:28,470 --> 00:17:30,300
There's not a chance now.

315
00:17:30,310 --> 00:17:32,190
No! We can find it!

316
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:35,580
Sorry,garrison,your penis is gone.

317
00:17:35,590 --> 00:17:37,790
I'm afraid there's
nothing more we can dO.

318
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:40,500
You'll just have to
live with being a woman.

319
00:17:40,510 --> 00:17:43,270
A very ugly one. Come on,men.

320
00:17:45,630 --> 00:17:49,440
Students,I want to congratulate
you on your amazing test scores.

321
00:17:49,450 --> 00:17:52,520
The school board is so
impressed with your progress,

322
00:17:52,550 --> 00:17:58,510
that they are going to let you take the standardized
advanced placement test for college credit!

323
00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:00,260
- Alright!
- Cool,man.

324
00:18:00,270 --> 00:18:04,340
The test is going to be heavily monitored
in a private room at their location

325
00:18:04,350 --> 00:18:08,050
to assure that there can
be absolutely no cheating.

326
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:09,750
Uh what?

327
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:11,100
The test will be tomorrow.

328
00:18:11,130 --> 00:18:13,090
Make us proud.

329
00:18:15,030 --> 00:18:17,300
Monitor us in a private room?

330
00:18:17,310 --> 00:18:19,810
Now they're gonna know we've
been cheating all along!

331
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:21,180
I knew it,man!

332
00:18:21,190 --> 00:18:24,380
You made us believe in your
way,and now it's all for nothing.

333
00:18:24,390 --> 00:18:25,220
It's not for nothing!

334
00:18:25,230 --> 00:18:27,370
If you're good enough you can
cheat right in front of them!

335
00:18:27,390 --> 00:18:29,900
Shut up man,you royally screwed us all!

336
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:33,970
How do I reeeeech these keeeeeds!

337
00:18:36,180 --> 00:18:40,170
Just before the last superbowl,bill
belichick gathered his football players

338
00:18:40,190 --> 00:18:42,970
and said "let's win this one for real.

339
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,220
Just this one time,let's not cheat."

340
00:18:46,230 --> 00:18:49,550
You know what happened? They losT.

341
00:18:50,260 --> 00:18:55,910
Even if you feel all eyes are upon
you,you cannot give on cheating

342
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:59,890
or else you can lose the
biggest game of your lives.

343
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:03,040
Yeah,come on,we can do this,guys.

344
00:19:03,050 --> 00:19:04,580
You are the true dreamers.

345
00:19:04,590 --> 00:19:06,190
Tomorrow you will prove it.

346
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:10,370
We will begin by reviewing how to print out
cheat sheets as labels for your bottled water.

347
00:19:17,090 --> 00:19:20,230
You did this to yourself,garrison.

348
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:22,990
Get your hopes up with a
stupid genetic experiment

349
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,580
and now all your money's
gone along with your penis.

350
00:19:32,170 --> 00:19:35,070
What
the --

351
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:41,990
why -- it's
my penis.

352
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:46,620
My penis came bacK. But why?

353
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:52,960
I guess it's true.

354
00:19:52,970 --> 00:19:55,490
What's that old saying?

355
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:59,730
If you love your penis,let it go?

356
00:20:01,610 --> 00:20:05,920
The standardized advanced placement test
is considered one of the most difficult

357
00:20:05,930 --> 00:20:08,980
and carefully monitored
tests in the country.

358
00:20:08,990 --> 00:20:11,300
Twenty four of our
students took the test

359
00:20:11,310 --> 00:20:16,210
and all twenty four
scored one hundred percent!

360
00:20:18,740 --> 00:20:20,380
Uh,can we say something?

361
00:20:20,390 --> 00:20:21,530
Sure.

362
00:20:21,540 --> 00:20:27,940
We would like to present this plaque to the person
who taught us the white people method,mr.Cartmanez.

363
00:20:39,830 --> 00:20:43,890
I reeeeched these keeeeeeeds.

364
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:49,410
Students and faculty,please
put your hands together

365
00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:54,200
and help me in welcoming
back mister garrison.

366
00:20:59,530 --> 00:21:00,940
Thanks,everyone.

367
00:21:00,950 --> 00:21:02,860
It's great to be bacK.

368
00:21:02,870 --> 00:21:04,530
I'm a man again.

369
00:21:04,540 --> 00:21:08,220
Thanks to my very special new friend.

370
00:21:09,770 --> 00:21:14,770
But you know,I've learned that
I've really been a dude all along.

371
00:21:14,780 --> 00:21:20,290
Because the key difference between men
and women,is that women can have babies.

372
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:24,020
If you can't have
babies,then you're a man.

373
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:26,750
Woa,uh,wait. Hang on a second.

374
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:31,040
My wife had ovarian cancer,so
she can't have babies.

375
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:35,900
Well,then get an aids test,thompson,
cuz your wife's a dude,faggot.

376
00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:40,130
Yeah! I'm back!

377
00:21:40,270 --> 00:21:43,360
