4
00:00:35,830 --> 00:00:37,670
Kids, everyone together.

5
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:39,940
Welcome to pioneer village.

6
00:00:39,950 --> 00:00:42,930
This is a re-creation
of early colorado days.

7
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:45,440
I want you all to meet pioneer paul.

8
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:47,750
Hi, kids, and welcome to my village.

9
00:00:47,770 --> 00:00:52,030
I settled here in 1864
with my maw and paw.

10
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:56,810
Sure thing, I ain't never seen strange
clothes like you all are wearing.

11
00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:01,440
And what's that fancy yellow
horse carriage you got out there?

12
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:03,160
This is gonna suck.

13
00:01:03,190 --> 00:01:05,920
When y'all are ready, just
head up to the village.

14
00:01:05,930 --> 00:01:09,010
All the townsfolk are there
to answer your questions.

15
00:01:09,050 --> 00:01:13,710
And welcome to 1864. Sit 'em up!

16
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:15,190
Thank you, pioneer paul.

17
00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:20,970
All right, kids, this is a big place so I want
everyone to pick a partner to hold hands with.

18
00:01:22,050 --> 00:01:23,200
Let's be partners, kenny.

19
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:24,970
No, I'm partners with craig.

20
00:01:24,980 --> 00:01:26,710
Oh, okay.

21
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:28,290
Stan, let's be partners, dude.

22
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:29,860
No, I'm with wendy.

23
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:32,960
You wanna hold hands
with a girl? Gaywad.

24
00:01:34,730 --> 00:01:36,850
All right, let's be partners, kyle.

25
00:01:36,860 --> 00:01:38,420
I hate you, remember?

26
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:39,910
You wanna be partners, jimmy?

27
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:42,010
Jesus, what have I ever done to you?

28
00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:43,500
Craig? Token?

29
00:01:43,510 --> 00:01:46,290
Who, who else needs a partner?

30
00:01:54,130 --> 00:01:55,470
Who else needs a partner?

31
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:56,920
Eric, partner with butters.

32
00:01:56,930 --> 00:01:58,500
God dammit!

33
00:01:58,510 --> 00:02:00,170
Hold butters' hand, eric.

34
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:01,520
That isn't necessary.

35
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:05,470
Butters, you are not to let go of eric's
hand until you are both back on that bus.

36
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:06,720
Do you understand?

37
00:02:06,730 --> 00:02:08,010
I understand.

38
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:10,520
All right, let's head in.

39
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:12,160
You can let go now, butters.

40
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:12,980
No.

41
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:14,120
Butters, come on.

42
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:15,490
No!

43
00:02:15,910 --> 00:02:19,590
All right, kids. Go ahead and visit
the charming villagers and learn stuff.

44
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:22,460
Keep trarack of your partner.

45
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:26,340
Why, howdy, partners.
I'm the town blacksmith.

46
00:02:26,350 --> 00:02:30,780
Are you folks settlers or are
you just trappers passing through?

47
00:02:30,790 --> 00:02:33,150
Uh, look, can we just drop
the role-playing thing?

48
00:02:33,170 --> 00:02:36,810
I would play along, but my girlfriend's here and
I don't wanna look like a dork in front of her.

49
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:37,850
Thanks, stan.

50
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:40,150
Those folk sure are strange, smithy.

51
00:02:40,170 --> 00:02:45,380
We ain't never seen them kind of
fancy hats in our time, have we?

52
00:02:45,390 --> 00:02:48,180
That guy's wearing a digital watch.

53
00:02:48,190 --> 00:02:50,260
Oh, jeez.

54
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:53,320
- Dammit, chad.
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

55
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:56,600
Howdy, partners. I'm the town gunsmith.

56
00:02:56,610 --> 00:02:59,250
You see, in our time,
it's pretty violent.

57
00:02:59,270 --> 00:03:01,220
See them holes in the walls?

58
00:03:01,230 --> 00:03:05,130
That's so we can put a rifle
through to protect us from indians.

59
00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:06,730
I wanna shoot an indian!

60
00:03:06,740 --> 00:03:09,970
Now some of you might want to meet
abigail at the candle making house.

61
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:13,390
Or you can head over the general store.

62
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:16,980
You see any indians?

63
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:22,140
Nah, it's just the city and a --
oh, my jesus christ monkey balls.

64
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:25,890
Super fun time.

65
00:03:27,370 --> 00:03:30,250
Dude, check it out. We're only
two blocks from a super fun time!

66
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:32,170
They got video games
and rides and everything!

67
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:35,000
Oh, that's cool. Come on, eric,
we need to catch up with everyone.

68
00:03:35,010 --> 00:03:37,410
Dude, screw this place. We
gotta go to super fun time!

69
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:40,570
Oh, no. I'm not sneaking
out. I'll get in trouble.

70
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:41,680
Fine. Then let go of my hand.

71
00:03:41,690 --> 00:03:44,280
Teacher said I can't let go
until we're back on the bus.

72
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:45,500
Well, which is it gonna be, butters?

73
00:03:45,530 --> 00:03:48,490
Are you gonna ditch out with me or are you
gonna disobey the teacher's stupid rule?

74
00:03:48,530 --> 00:03:50,060
I'm not letting go.

75
00:03:50,070 --> 00:03:51,390
Fine. Then you're coming with me.

76
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,340
No, eric!

77
00:03:52,350 --> 00:03:54,420
Butters, let go, god dammit!

78
00:03:54,450 --> 00:03:58,290
No! Teacher! Teacher!

79
00:03:58,300 --> 00:04:00,990
This here is our general store.

80
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,890
It's where I buy all
my supplies and sucH.

81
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:07,900
Howdy, partners. I own
this here general store.

82
00:04:07,910 --> 00:04:10,250
Look, stan, they had
beef jerky back then.

83
00:04:10,270 --> 00:04:12,400
What do you mean back then?

84
00:04:12,470 --> 00:04:15,840
Don't forget it's 1864!

85
00:04:15,850 --> 00:04:17,610
Right. Except for it really isn'T.

86
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:21,220
Sure it is. Just look around you.

87
00:04:23,150 --> 00:04:25,350
What's that? It sounds
like police sirens.

88
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,910
What's a siren?

89
00:04:26,930 --> 00:04:31,660
We ain't never heard
of no siren in 1864.

90
00:04:37,130 --> 00:04:38,360
We lost 'em! We lost 'em!

91
00:04:38,370 --> 00:04:42,050
Damn pig cops. Close that gate!

92
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:45,550
- What's going on?
- I don't know.

93
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:48,100
Everyone down on the ground. Now!

94
00:04:48,110 --> 00:04:51,250
Whoa now! I'm sheriff mclawdog.

95
00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:55,230
I settled here
back in 1850 --

96
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:57,440
Jesus christ!

97
00:04:57,450 --> 00:04:59,820
We got to call the
police! Where's your phone?

98
00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:02,300
A phone? Why, what's a phone?

99
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:04,550
We ain't never heard of such a thing.

100
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:06,710
What? Come on, this is serious!

101
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:10,670
Store hand, you ever heard
of this fancy smancy phone?

102
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:14,700
Uh, no. We ain't got
a phone in our time.

103
00:05:14,710 --> 00:05:17,000
Dude, they just shot a guy in the face.

104
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:18,340
We got to call the cops.

105
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:22,960
If you mean the law, only law round
here is town sheriff, mclawdog.

106
00:05:22,970 --> 00:05:27,070
You see, 1864 is a time of growth
and development in the old west --

107
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:29,750
This is not the time for that!

108
00:05:30,350 --> 00:05:33,120
Oh, man, this is gonna be awesome!

109
00:05:35,190 --> 00:05:38,070
Butters, if you don't let go of my hand
everyone here is going to think we're gay.

110
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:40,440
Well, that's your problem.

111
00:05:40,470 --> 00:05:43,750
All right, butters. I've
seriously had enough!

112
00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:48,900
Jesus christ.

113
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:52,180
- One, please.
- Make that two.

114
00:05:52,190 --> 00:05:54,030
Aw, aren't you two cute holding hands.

115
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:55,670
Are you special little buddies?

116
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:58,000
No!

117
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:04,530
Dude, this place sleds!

118
00:06:04,550 --> 00:06:05,570
What should we do first?

119
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:08,670
We should get back to the pioneer
village. That's what we should do!

120
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:11,570
Butters, we're going to be back before
anybody even notices we were gone.

121
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:13,890
Let's go hit the bumper cars.

122
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:18,340
Over here! This looks like an office.

123
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:21,780
Here! Here's a phone.

124
00:06:21,790 --> 00:06:24,140
Why, what a strange contraption.

125
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:26,190
I can't get a dial tone.

126
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,600
What's the number to dial out?

127
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:28,700
Dial out?

128
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:31,600
Partner, them are some
funny words you're using.

129
00:06:31,610 --> 00:06:33,530
Dude, do you understand
what's going on here?

130
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:36,490
Maybe they're right, brian. I mean
this is a special circumstance.

131
00:06:38,850 --> 00:06:41,060
NEVER BREAK CHARACTER!

132
00:06:41,970 --> 00:06:45,790
Hah, I mean, this here
room sure is strange.

133
00:06:45,810 --> 00:06:48,710
We have nothing like these
fancy devices in our time!

134
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,480
Well, I'll say.

135
00:06:50,490 --> 00:06:52,200
I got through! Hello, police?

136
00:06:52,210 --> 00:06:53,800
911, what's your emergency?

137
00:06:53,810 --> 00:06:56,910
There's some terrorists or bank robbers or
something that've taken our class hostage.

138
00:06:56,930 --> 00:06:58,200
Taken hostage where?

139
00:06:58,210 --> 00:07:00,040
The old pioneer village off of kipling.

140
00:07:00,070 --> 00:07:03,810
You mean that annoying place where
employees won't break character?

141
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:06,220
Sister, you don't know the half of it.

142
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:13,460
Check it out, dude! I'm a spaceman!

143
00:07:13,470 --> 00:07:15,810
Spaceman, yes!

144
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:18,190
* I'm having a super fun time day *

145
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:20,330

146
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:21,850
Yeah, now over here!

147
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:25,340
You got it! Nice!

148
00:07:26,130 --> 00:07:29,130
* Super fun time please don't go away *

149
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:36,250
What are you oogling at?

150
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:40,490
* No more worries or
cares it's super fun time *

151
00:07:41,030 --> 00:07:44,890
* the answer to my
prayers super fun time *

152
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:49,060

153
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:54,310
* I wanna super fun time

154
00:07:55,430 --> 00:07:58,620
* I want you morning, noon

155
00:07:58,630 --> 00:08:00,670
*********

156
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:03,450
* you make my life so
right super fun time *

157
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:05,840
That's it, eric. We
have to be getting back!

158
00:08:05,850 --> 00:08:07,410
Aw, just a few more things.

159
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:12,440
No! If we don't leave right now, we're gonna
miss the bus and then they'll know we left!

160
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:16,290
I guess you're right,
butters. All right. Come on.

161
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:18,070
Set up the satellite relay.

162
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:20,460
Check for alternate
routes out of the area.

163
00:08:20,470 --> 00:08:25,010
Unfortunately, your police department got
wind of our robbery and chased after us.

164
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:26,980
That is unfortunate for you.

165
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,910
Because when I think
it is clear to leave,

166
00:08:28,930 --> 00:08:34,190
we will now need to take hostages with us to
ensure our goods get to their final destination.

167
00:08:34,210 --> 00:08:36,960
Please, if you must take
anyone, don't take me.

168
00:08:36,990 --> 00:08:39,480
These kids are worth more to you.

169
00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:42,430
How did they find us?

170
00:08:42,450 --> 00:08:46,080
Get the loot out of the car
and stash it in that building.

171
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:51,120
All right, men, listen up.

172
00:08:51,150 --> 00:08:53,210
Looks like our thieves
tried to hide out here.

173
00:08:53,230 --> 00:08:56,430
They've got the employees and
some school kids held hostage.

174
00:08:56,460 --> 00:08:58,170
Tucker, dylan, set up a perimeter.

175
00:08:58,180 --> 00:08:59,460
Everyone stay on your toes.

176
00:08:59,470 --> 00:09:01,410
These are professionals
we're dealing with here.

177
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:03,430
What did they rob, sir?

178
00:09:03,450 --> 00:09:05,950
A burger king.

179
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:08,400
All right. Good. Is that all of it?

180
00:09:08,410 --> 00:09:11,330
No, don't forget we got these too.

181
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:14,230
Excellent. Now listen, everyone.
We're going to be all right.

182
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:17,530
This is only a small hitch in our plan.

183
00:09:19,450 --> 00:09:22,560
I'd like to speak with
the chief of police.

184
00:09:22,570 --> 00:09:23,880
Who is this?

185
00:09:23,890 --> 00:09:26,820
This is the man who is going to kill
an entire class of fourth graders

186
00:09:26,830 --> 00:09:30,510
if he doesn't get exactly what he wants.

187
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:37,590
Why aren't the cops coming in?

188
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:38,900
They must be negotiating.

189
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:41,550
Them there bandits sure
look mighty strange.

190
00:09:41,570 --> 00:09:44,320
And them pistols is way
bigger than what we gots.

191
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:45,920
Will you shut up?

192
00:09:45,930 --> 00:09:47,100
Wait, you have guns here?

193
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:49,970
Sure. Sheriff got lots
of rifles in his office.

194
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:52,170
Well, why don't you go get
them and bring them back here.

195
00:09:52,190 --> 00:09:54,070
All righty. Come on, store hand.

196
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:56,030
Yepper!

197
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:58,940
Oh, man, I can't wait to
see the look on kyle's face

198
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:02,880
when we tell him we had super fun time while
he was at the dumb, stupid pioneer village.

199
00:10:02,890 --> 00:10:04,480
We're not telling anybody!

200
00:10:04,490 --> 00:10:05,790
I don't want to get in trouble.

201
00:10:05,830 --> 00:10:08,580
And i didn't have a
super fun time anyways.

202
00:10:08,610 --> 00:10:10,070
Butters, you got to learn to chill.

203
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:11,640
Life goes by pretty fast.

204
00:10:11,650 --> 00:10:13,320
If you don't stop and look
around once in a while,

205
00:10:13,330 --> 00:10:15,760
and do whatever you want all
the time, you could miss it.

206
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:18,230
Yeah, well, I guess that's kinda true.

207
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:22,690
Crap, they called the cops on us.

208
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:24,790
What? They called the caps?

209
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,570
They must have realized we left. Damn!

210
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:28,770
Oh, my god, the police
are looking for us?

211
00:10:28,780 --> 00:10:30,880
- Butters!
- We're gonna get it now.

212
00:10:30,890 --> 00:10:33,030
Butters, butters, calm down.
I know a way out of this.

213
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:36,470
You just got me busted forever!

214
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:38,730
Butters, listen to me. Listen.

215
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:39,680
No.

216
00:10:39,690 --> 00:10:42,580
All we have to do is sneak back
inside without the cops seeing us.

217
00:10:42,590 --> 00:10:44,280
Then we can say we
were inside all along.

218
00:10:44,290 --> 00:10:49,180
You said they wouldn't notice
we were gone. You promised.

219
00:10:52,470 --> 00:10:56,160
If we sneak back inside we can
say we never left. All right?

220
00:10:57,410 --> 00:10:58,850
All right. Now let go of my hand.

221
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:00,210
- No. -
Butters --

222
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:02,660
You made me break one rule.
I'm not breaking the other!

223
00:11:02,670 --> 00:11:05,020
It's all I have now.

224
00:11:05,030 --> 00:11:07,230
All right, come on.

225
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:09,940
Keep the hostages from talking
and search for holdouts.

226
00:11:09,950 --> 00:11:12,950
Everyone check in at
two-minute intervals.

227
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:14,910
I hope you have good news, orlich.

228
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:17,690
The police have us completely
surrounded on all sides.

229
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:20,630
There's no way we're getting out
above ground without being spotted.

230
00:11:20,650 --> 00:11:21,790
Above ground?

231
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:24,870
Look. I found this at
the rear of the park.

232
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:26,260
It's an old mine shaft.

233
00:11:26,270 --> 00:11:28,720
But pioneer village was
sued when a kid died in it,

234
00:11:28,730 --> 00:11:32,680
so they closed it down and protected it
with a huge metal door with a coded lock.

235
00:11:32,710 --> 00:11:37,570
So, if we can get into the shaft, we can
tunnel our way around the police. Excellent.

236
00:11:38,050 --> 00:11:39,810
One more thing, franz.

237
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:42,120
I want my share of the take now.

238
00:11:42,150 --> 00:11:44,990
What's the matter, arlich?
Lose your sense of trust?

239
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,380
I was just thinking maybe
we get through that tunnel,

240
00:11:47,410 --> 00:11:50,400
then you take the loot to
berlin and I never see you again.

241
00:11:50,410 --> 00:11:52,590

***************

246
00:12:18,830 --> 00:12:20,070
You are an employee here.

247
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:23,740
That means you are required to know
the door code for fire code reasons.

248
00:12:23,770 --> 00:12:27,120
Mr. David palmer of colorado springs.

249
00:12:27,130 --> 00:12:30,000
My name ain't palmer. It's ol' smithy.

250
00:12:30,010 --> 00:12:32,070
And we ain't never
heard of no fire code.

251
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:35,670
Why, we got to put fires out ourselves.

252
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:39,300
That's it. Tell me the code or you die.

253
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:44,520
One,
two --

254
00:12:44,530 --> 00:12:46,780
- I -
- Yes?

255
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:49,930
I don't know nothing
about no fancy door code.

256
00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:52,870
I'm just a simple blacksmith.

257
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:59,060
These pioneer village workers
are really committed to their job.

258
00:12:59,070 --> 00:13:01,500
No! Please! Don't hurt me!

259
00:13:01,510 --> 00:13:05,000
Give us the code to that
door and we can leave!

260
00:13:05,550 --> 00:13:08,490
I never heard of something
called a door code.

261
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:10,860
Please, can't you ask some other way?

262
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:12,970
I don't have time for your stupid game!

263
00:13:12,980 --> 00:13:14,740
Tell me or you die right now!

264
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:15,990
All right, all right.

265
00:13:16,010 --> 00:13:19,740
Look, it's just one of those
new jinkins home security locks.

266
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:23,720
You press the top button
and then enter 5, 2 --

267
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:31,570
What he meant to say, kids, is that we
ain't never heard of no fancy door code

268
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:36,000
'cuz in our time we got to
rely on wood locks and such.

269
00:13:36,010 --> 00:13:39,240
God dammit, you people are Insane!

270
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:40,720
I don't believe it.

271
00:13:40,730 --> 00:13:41,940
Domino! Volski!

272
00:13:41,950 --> 00:13:45,410
Find out if there are any other
employees or students wandering about.

273
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:47,760
Bring them here or shoot them.

274
00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:49,950
Oh, crap, we got to hide! Come on.

275
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:55,940
Yeah, we gotta, got, get
the hell outta here fast!

276
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:02,490
Sector bravo, no activity.

277
00:14:02,790 --> 00:14:05,150
Jeez, the cops are
looking for us everywhere.

278
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:07,930
Don't worry. They're not gonna find
us until we're safely back inside.

279
00:14:07,940 --> 00:14:10,530
Look, see that traffic
signal down there?

280
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:13,880
If we can climb across that, we can jump
to the tree branch and then we're home free.

281
00:14:13,890 --> 00:14:15,140
That looks dangerous.

282
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:18,180
Not getting busted always
is, butters. Come on.

283
00:14:23,450 --> 00:14:27,560
Good! That's got it. Good!
All right, now head across.

284
00:14:29,390 --> 00:14:30,770
Go easy. Good.

285
00:14:30,780 --> 00:14:32,050
Oh, gosh in heaven.

286
00:14:32,070 --> 00:14:34,530
It's all right. We got it.

287
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:36,660
- Save me!
- I'm gonna fall!

288
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:46,040
Oh, dude. Lame.

289
00:14:48,330 --> 00:14:50,950
Frolich, check in. Have you
found any other employees?

290
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:52,270
We found somebody.

291
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:55,550
We found this guy in the
jail of the sheriff's office.

292
00:14:56,540 --> 00:14:58,640
You let out murdering murphy!

293
00:14:58,650 --> 00:15:02,090
Y'all are gonna get it for
putting me in that there jail.

294
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:05,340
Stop it! Stop your bad
historical acting right now.

295
00:15:05,350 --> 00:15:08,140
Tarnation, why'd you
let murdering murphy go?

296
00:15:08,150 --> 00:15:09,370
He's a bad man.

297
00:15:09,380 --> 00:15:11,370
I'm the Bad man!

298
00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:12,300
Do you get that?

299
00:15:12,310 --> 00:15:15,600
Knock it off and give me
the mine shaft access code.

300
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:17,490
You're just gonna have
to kill us, mister.

301
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:19,880
'Cuz you ain't making no sense at all.

302
00:15:19,890 --> 00:15:21,610
I won't kill you if you don't tell me.

303
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:23,750
I'll kill one of them!

304
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:27,330
Not me! Not me! Not me! Not me! Not me!

305
00:15:27,990 --> 00:15:30,120
You want to see a child die?

306
00:15:30,130 --> 00:15:32,470
No! They don't want to see a child

307
00:15:40,330 --> 00:15:43,400
I am so disappointed in myself.

308
00:15:43,410 --> 00:15:45,410
Teacher gave me a responsibility.

309
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:49,710
I was just supposed to look
after my partner and I blew it.

310
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:51,270
Don't be too hard on yourself, butters.

311
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:53,650
You can't help being a douche bag.

312
00:15:53,670 --> 00:15:56,220
Wait, butters! Look!

313
00:15:56,940 --> 00:16:00,370
This is it. This is our
chance! Swing over, butters. Go!

314
00:16:04,510 --> 00:16:05,920
Quick, are you ready? We got to jump!

315
00:16:05,930 --> 00:16:08,690
- Let's do it.
- Ready? Go!

316
00:16:16,630 --> 00:16:17,900
What about you?

317
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:21,560
Will you tell us the access code,
or do you want to see this kid die?

318
00:16:21,570 --> 00:16:23,520
I'm sorry. I'm a woman.

319
00:16:23,530 --> 00:16:27,160
And women in our timime ain't allowed to
know the carryings-on of the town proper.

320
00:16:27,170 --> 00:16:29,680
God dammit!

321
00:16:29,690 --> 00:16:32,730
Dude! They're gonna kill kenny!

322
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:34,610
I can't let them do it.

323
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:37,400
I've got to make the ultimate sacrifice.

324
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:40,530
Stan?

325
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:42,640
Where are you going, stan?

326
00:16:42,650 --> 00:16:44,470
Wendy, I have to do something.

327
00:16:44,490 --> 00:16:46,660
Please look away.

328
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:50,880
All right, that does it.

329
00:16:50,890 --> 00:16:52,970
On the count of three this child dies.

330
00:16:52,990 --> 00:16:56,220
- One, two - - Give
them the Door code!

331
00:16:56,230 --> 00:16:59,090
Well, howdy there, strangers!

332
00:17:00,090 --> 00:17:01,460
Sorry to interrupt you.

333
00:17:01,470 --> 00:17:05,910
But i done come from pagosa springs
to buy me some wares and such.

334
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:09,330
- Oh, welcome, partner!
- Howdy!

335
00:17:09,340 --> 00:17:10,630
- Welcome!
- Howdy there!

336
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:11,760
What, what are you doing?

337
00:17:11,770 --> 00:17:15,520
Say, i heard y'all had some difficulty
with a criminal getting out of your jail.

338
00:17:15,530 --> 00:17:17,150
That's right! Murdering murphy!

339
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:19,300
He's crazy 'cuz somebody killed his paw.

340
00:17:19,310 --> 00:17:21,370
They killed my paw!

341
00:17:21,390 --> 00:17:26,420
I reckon that maybe you could make a jail
door that opened with numbers instead of keys.

342
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:29,760
You know like a big safe.

343
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:32,830
Yeah! I understand that!

344
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:36,080
Finally, a feller that talks some sensE.

345
00:17:36,090 --> 00:17:38,630
If y'all was to have such a giant safe,

346
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:43,360
what would you villagers want the number to
be to unlock that there jail door shuck 'em up?

347
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:46,290
Well, i reckon the
easiest number to remember

348
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:51,510
for any big safe door
lock would be 1864.

349
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:55,940
Up! 1864, 'cuz that's what year it is!

350
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:01,380
We'll take the hostages with us.

351
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:03,640
No! You got your door code. Let us go!

352
00:18:03,650 --> 00:18:06,440
Copy that. What's the code, over?

353
00:18:06,450 --> 00:18:07,910
Sweet. There's still cops
looking for us in here.

354
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:10,030
All right. Follow my lead, butters.

355
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:13,110
Oh, man, hasn't this place
been fascinating, butters?

356
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:14,570
Yeah, it sure has.

357
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:16,050
Oh, I just don't know
what I've liked better --

358
00:18:16,060 --> 00:18:18,860
the historical buildings
and artifacts or the, the --

359
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:20,830
Or the witty anecdotes
of the towns people.

360
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:23,190
Witty anecdotes, yes.
That's been awesome.

361
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:24,440
Been a hoot. All right!

362
00:18:24,450 --> 00:18:25,950
Get your hands behind your head.

363
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:27,820
What'd we do? We've
been here the whole time.

364
00:18:27,830 --> 00:18:31,250
Shut up! Put your hands
behind your head. Do it now!

365
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:37,200
Let go of each other!

366
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:39,020
Do what I tell you!

367
00:18:39,030 --> 00:18:42,260
Our teacher said we have to hold
hands the whole time we're here!

368
00:18:42,270 --> 00:18:45,640
Let go or else I'll put a bullet
through your hands and make you let go!

369
00:18:45,650 --> 00:18:46,430
ButterS.

370
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:49,360
- Now!
- No!

371
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:56,400
Jesus christ!

372
00:19:00,950 --> 00:19:04,210
Go! Go take care of it.
I'll stay with the hostages.

373
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:09,310
Hey, murdering murphy.
You see that there feller?

374
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:10,340
Yeah.

375
00:19:10,350 --> 00:19:12,010
He done killed your paw.

376
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:15,110
What? I'll rip his head off!

377
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:20,140
We got a chance! Hostages are clear!

378
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:24,740
They're coming in!

379
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:38,360
Hostages are secure
at the park entrance.

380
00:19:38,370 --> 00:19:40,660
I got you now, pioneer paul.

381
00:19:40,670 --> 00:19:44,050
They should have never let you
out of jail, murdering murphy.

382
00:19:53,430 --> 00:19:56,820
Freeze, scumbag! It's all over!

383
00:19:59,730 --> 00:20:02,250
murdering murphy's
gonna kill pioneer paul.

384
00:20:02,260 --> 00:20:05,180
Stop right now! It's over!

385
00:20:08,730 --> 00:20:11,110
Howdy, partners. It's 5 o'clock.

386
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:13,910
Pioneer village is
now closed for the day.

387
00:20:13,930 --> 00:20:17,010
Head back to your wagons
and have a safe trip home!

388
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:19,840
We made it! We maid it!

389
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:23,080
Oh, god. It can't wait
to get out of this dress!

390
00:20:23,380 --> 00:20:25,680
- That was great!
- Oh, what a day!

391
00:20:25,690 --> 00:20:28,960
Listen, if anyone still wants to know, the
phone is in the administration building.

392
00:20:28,970 --> 00:20:32,550
You dial 9 to get out and there's actually
a back exit behind the horse troughs.

393
00:20:32,570 --> 00:20:35,420
Good night, everybody. Thanks
for coming. We did it, guys!

394
00:20:35,430 --> 00:20:37,880
Let's go to tgi fridays and
get some jalapeno poppers!

395
00:20:37,890 --> 00:20:38,860
Yeah! That'd be great!

396
00:20:38,870 --> 00:20:42,350
All right Let's go!

397
00:20:45,220 --> 00:20:46,990
Stan, you were really brave in there.

398
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,950
But you did kinda sound like a big dork.

399
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:49,860
I know.

400
00:20:49,870 --> 00:20:50,960
Come on, you!

401
00:20:50,980 --> 00:20:53,150
You're hurting my arm! Too bad.

402
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:55,070
You'll be going away a long time.

403
00:20:55,090 --> 00:20:56,490
Was it worth it?

404
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:58,260
In a way, it was.

405
00:20:58,280 --> 00:21:03,160
I might not have gotten away, but at least I
learned a lot about pioneer life in the old west.

406
00:21:03,170 --> 00:21:08,240
Those early settlers didn't have all the
modern conveniences we all take for granted.

407
00:21:08,250 --> 00:21:13,710
To think how difficult it was back those times
to do something as simple as washing your clothes.

408
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:15,920
Pioneer village has
a lot to teach us all.

409
00:21:15,930 --> 00:21:17,960
That's true.

410
00:21:19,530 --> 00:21:21,110
Hey, look!

411
00:21:35,930 --> 00:21:39,490
Teacher, my partner is back on the bus.



9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
