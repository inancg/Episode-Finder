1
00:00:34,981 --> 00:00:40,150
There's anyone here tonight and still doubts that America is a place where all things are possible?

2
00:00:40,394 --> 00:00:44,266
Who still wanders if the dream of our founders is alive in our time?

3
00:00:44,492 --> 00:00:47,048
Who still questions the power of our democracy?

4
00:00:47,218 --> 00:00:48,740
Tonight is your answer.

5
00:00:50,883 --> 00:00:57,387
YEAH! OBAMA! WHOOO! We did it! The effort did it!

6
00:00:57,199 --> 00:01:00,845
It's been long time but tonight because of what we did on this day

7
00:01:00,845 --> 00:01:04,699
in this election in this defining moment, change has come to America.

8
00:01:04,962 --> 00:01:11,315
YEAH! Yeah, Obama! Change! It's-- It's change!

9
00:01:11,390 --> 00:01:14,624
Sasha, Malia Ann, I love you both more than you can imagine.

10
00:01:14,718 --> 00:01:18,063
And you've earned the new puppy that's coming with us to the white house.

11
00:01:18,157 --> 00:01:20,056
We will name him Sparkles.

12
00:01:21,165 --> 00:01:25,789
He's so awesome! He's so perfect and awesome!

13
00:01:26,015 --> 00:01:29,755
Where we are met with citizens are in doubt and those who tell us we can't,

14
00:01:29,793 --> 00:01:33,834
we will respond with timeless creed that sums up the spirit of the people.

15
00:01:33,966 --> 00:01:35,507
Yes, we can.

16
00:01:35,639 --> 00:01:38,214
Yes, we can.

17
00:01:38,289 --> 00:01:39,830
Yes, I can.

18
00:01:40,112 --> 00:01:41,729
Yes, I can.

19
00:01:42,330 --> 00:01:46,390
Here comes the change, everybody. Whooo!

20
00:01:47,086 --> 00:01:49,398
Did you see, our man is in.

21
00:01:49,473 --> 00:01:50,338
We did it.

22
00:01:50,375 --> 00:01:52,763
Everything is gonna be awesome now.

23
00:01:52,875 --> 00:01:55,056
This is the greatest day of our lives.

24
00:01:55,150 --> 00:01:56,597
Yes, we can.

25
00:01:56,672 --> 00:01:58,890
I don't even know what to do now.

26
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:00,890
I know what to do.

27
00:02:01,447 --> 00:02:03,552
Loosers!

28
00:02:03,552 --> 00:02:05,996
Loosers!

29
00:02:05,996 --> 00:02:07,996
Loosers.

30
00:02:08,496 --> 00:02:11,259
- Loosers.
- Ah, shut up!

31
00:02:11,259 --> 00:02:13,259
- Loosers.
- We lost?

32
00:02:13,609 --> 00:02:15,259
It is natural.

33
00:02:15,259 --> 00:02:18,289
It's natural tonight to feel some disappointment.

34
00:02:18,289 --> 00:02:20,289
We fought as hard as we could.

35
00:02:20,289 --> 00:02:23,947
And though we feel short, the failure is mine, not yours.

36
00:02:23,947 --> 00:02:26,710
- Oh, no.
- Uh, no!

37
00:02:26,710 --> 00:02:29,530
Poor old John McCaine. Well, he looks real sad.

38
00:02:29,530 --> 00:02:32,800
No! No, this can't happen! No!

39
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:35,187
- Steven!
- It's all over, Linda.

40
00:02:35,187 --> 00:02:37,575
The country as we know it is about to change.

41
00:02:37,819 --> 00:02:40,056
We're all dead!

42
00:02:40,469 --> 00:02:42,105
You don't know that, Steven.

43
00:02:42,105 --> 00:02:44,887
With an unexperienced man as a president we do know it.

44
00:02:44,887 --> 00:02:47,725
He's right, game over man, m'kay.

45
00:02:47,725 --> 00:02:50,319
We probably be dead by sunrise.

46
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:53,101
Butters. Daddy loves you.

47
00:02:53,101 --> 00:02:56,672
Just remember that, he always loved you.

48
00:02:58,026 --> 00:03:01,315
- Whooo! Obama!
- Get out of here!

49
00:03:05,770 --> 00:03:07,443
Dude, have you seen my parents?

50
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:10,939
No, everyone's out partying in the streets.

51
00:03:12,537 --> 00:03:13,684
What's wrong with your brother?

52
00:03:13,684 --> 00:03:15,037
He was a McCaine supporter.

53
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:18,872
It's ok, Ike, Obama will do fine.

54
00:03:23,233 --> 00:03:29,210
Mr. president, over there. Great job. Great job, mr. president. Great job, Obama.

55
00:03:29,210 --> 00:03:30,864
Thank you all for your support.

56
00:03:30,864 --> 00:03:34,774
If you don't mind, we gonna be spend the rest of the evening getting so much needed rest.

57
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:40,939
Senator McCaine?

58
00:03:41,503 --> 00:03:43,796
President Obama?

59
00:03:50,883 --> 00:03:52,274
Boom, baby!

60
00:03:52,274 --> 00:03:56,334
Ho-ho, man, that was perfect. I almost thought we're gonna tie for a minute there.

61
00:03:56,334 --> 00:03:57,650
That would have screwed us.

62
00:03:57,650 --> 00:03:59,650
You played it perfectly, there was no way.

63
00:03:59,650 --> 00:04:02,631
It's McCaine, we did it. Obama is president.

64
00:04:03,139 --> 00:04:06,823
Yeah, so I've heared. You guys are out of your freaking minds, you know that?

65
00:04:06,823 --> 00:04:10,263
Yes, we do. Assemble the rest of the team, we've only got 10 hours.

66
00:04:10,263 --> 00:04:12,011
Sure, hard part's over, right?

67
00:04:12,011 --> 00:04:14,398
Actually, the hard part's just starting.

68
00:04:24,718 --> 00:04:28,148
O-ba-ma. O-ba-ma.

69
00:04:28,148 --> 00:04:31,447
O-ba-ma. O-ba-ma.

70
00:04:31,447 --> 00:04:35,451
Ce-le-brate good Obama, c'mon.

71
00:04:36,898 --> 00:04:39,172
It's O-bam-o-bama.

72
00:04:46,127 --> 00:04:48,308
Yes, I'd like to make a noise complaint.

73
00:04:55,375 --> 00:04:57,631
Who let the Obama out?

74
00:05:03,082 --> 00:05:06,522
Oh, police are here. Whooo.

75
00:05:06,522 --> 00:05:08,684
Whooo.

76
00:05:08,646 --> 00:05:12,236
Okay people, time to disperse. Party is over.

77
00:05:12,236 --> 00:05:15,563
Pooo-- The party Obama.

78
00:05:15,751 --> 00:05:17,969
Come on, time to go home.

79
00:05:17,969 --> 00:05:20,187
What are you a McCaine voter?

80
00:05:20,187 --> 00:05:21,353
Yeah!

81
00:05:21,347 --> 00:05:24,248
Sorry pal, but Obama's president now.

82
00:05:24,248 --> 00:05:27,387
O-ba-ma. O-ba-ma.

83
00:05:27,387 --> 00:05:30,206
O-ba-ma! O-ba-ma!

84
00:05:30,206 --> 00:05:33,684
Yeah, flip-- Flip the cop car! Flip the cop car!

85
00:05:34,266 --> 00:05:36,409
Hey! Put down my car.

86
00:05:37,011 --> 00:05:38,515
Yes, we can!

87
00:05:39,849 --> 00:05:43,533
No! No, ain't stop it.

88
00:05:43,834 --> 00:05:45,131
Jesus Christ!

89
00:05:45,131 --> 00:05:52,105
Whohoo. O-bama, you so fine, you so fine, you blew my mind. Hey Obama, hey Obama.

90
00:05:54,868 --> 00:05:56,936
Hey, you guys wanna buy a TV?

91
00:06:12,218 --> 00:06:14,266
Bravo, Obama and McCaine.

92
00:06:14,492 --> 00:06:18,796
Ten years you two have been working on this plan and you've finally poured it off.

93
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:23,327
Guys we've all know each other a long time, had many incredible adventures.

94
00:06:23,327 --> 00:06:26,033
But this is going be our greatest feat ever.

95
00:06:26,259 --> 00:06:31,071
I knew it. I knew when you two ran for president you were just working an angle.

96
00:06:31,071 --> 00:06:33,071
Always working the angles.

97
00:06:33,251 --> 00:06:36,898
My friends, while the entire country is busy reacting to elections

98
00:06:37,067 --> 00:06:41,259
we are about to pull of the greatest heist in human history.

99
00:06:42,161 --> 00:06:46,691
So, come on, enlighten us. What are we stealing this time?

100
00:06:52,969 --> 00:06:57,255
The Hope Diamond. Rated No. 4 out of 10 most precious diamonds in the world.

101
00:06:57,255 --> 00:07:01,654
Going street value Middle-Eastern market of course 210 million dollars.

102
00:07:01,654 --> 00:07:03,477
210?

103
00:07:03,834 --> 00:07:05,338
Million.

104
00:07:05,338 --> 00:07:10,037
No, no, no. The Hope Diamond in ungettable, every thief in the world knows that.

105
00:07:10,037 --> 00:07:11,127
Almost ungettable.

106
00:07:12,875 --> 00:07:18,796
The diamond is kept in the Smithsonian Natural History Museum long considered the most thiefproof structure ever built.

107
00:07:19,041 --> 00:07:22,537
The Diamond rings is protected by impenetrable walls of two foot wide steel

108
00:07:22,537 --> 00:07:25,300
on northe-east side - a 75-laser system.

109
00:07:25,676 --> 00:07:29,154
There's simply no side of the Smithsonian that can be breached.

110
00:07:29,229 --> 00:07:31,936
So, you're go in through the roof? Drop to it from the top?

111
00:07:31,936 --> 00:07:35,601
I can't do it from the top. Because the palmer shelf fronts the entire expense.

112
00:07:35,733 --> 00:07:40,864
Okay, you can't get into museum from any side and you can't drop in from above. So you can't get the diamond.

113
00:07:42,763 --> 00:07:45,413
Meet the presidential escape tunnel.

114
00:07:45,413 --> 00:07:50,902
A two mile long underground passage that runs from the white house to location outside the city limits in case of an attack.

115
00:07:50,902 --> 00:07:55,150
The tunnel is only accessible from the Oval Office and just happens to travel--

116
00:07:55,150 --> 00:07:58,327
right underneath the Smithsonian Natural History Museum.

117
00:07:59,586 --> 00:08:00,827
Boom, baby!

118
00:08:01,278 --> 00:08:04,680
You get somebody into that tunnel, they can blast into the museum,

119
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:07,161
let the others in. The heist is on.

120
00:08:07,462 --> 00:08:13,233
So, you both ran for president, because one of you has to win and you've got your access to the tunnel.

121
00:08:13,496 --> 00:08:16,259
And we ran a particulary brutal campaign so

122
00:08:16,259 --> 00:08:20,469
that the nation is as distracted as possible during the next-- 8 hours.

123
00:08:21,184 --> 00:08:23,270
This all sounds very risky.

124
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:25,808
We spent 10 years putting this plan together.

125
00:08:25,808 --> 00:08:28,515
If we indeed the best thief club in the world

126
00:08:28,515 --> 00:08:31,090
And we are. We won't get caught.

127
00:08:33,195 --> 00:08:35,413
Yes, I am trying to locate my parents.

128
00:08:35,413 --> 00:08:37,413
My name is Kyle Broflovsky.

129
00:08:38,233 --> 00:08:39,999
Yes, I know Obama won.

130
00:08:40,357 --> 00:08:42,481
- Kyle, Kyle, you got to get out of here.
- What?

131
00:08:42,481 --> 00:08:45,169
Your little brother's climbed out of the window. I think he's gonna jump.

132
00:08:45,169 --> 00:08:46,484
Oh my god!

133
00:08:50,507 --> 00:08:53,496
Ike, don't do it. There's still so much to live for.

134
00:08:56,917 --> 00:09:00,281
I know you really wanted McCaine to win but-- but it's gonna be OK.

135
00:09:05,375 --> 00:09:09,191
No, that's not true, Ike. The economy could easily stabilize with Obama's plan.

136
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:14,135
Ike, don't jump, you could easily hurt your ankle or something.

137
00:09:16,390 --> 00:09:18,966
Really, Ike, that's like 5 feets off the ground. Don't do it.

138
00:09:22,312 --> 00:09:23,477
No!

139
00:09:26,165 --> 00:09:28,665
Ike! Oh crap, Ike!

140
00:09:32,951 --> 00:09:35,206
Alright, everyone, I'm turning in for the night.

141
00:09:35,206 --> 00:09:37,206
Got a standard security, team three.

142
00:09:37,206 --> 00:09:39,398
Sir! Sir, we have bit of a problem.

143
00:09:39,398 --> 00:09:41,691
- What?
- The new president-elect is here.

144
00:09:41,691 --> 00:09:43,691
He wants enter the Oval Office.

145
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:45,883
Barack Obama?

146
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:54,699
They are-- They are all right through here, sir.

147
00:09:55,695 --> 00:09:59,097
Ah, hello. Is there something we can do for you, mr. Obama?

148
00:09:59,097 --> 00:10:01,973
Just checking out the new digs. How are you guys?

149
00:10:02,913 --> 00:10:04,229
Good, sir.

150
00:10:04,229 --> 00:10:06,616
I'd like to see the Oval Office, please.

151
00:10:07,462 --> 00:10:08,740
Right now?

152
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:12,875
I don't waste time, gentlemen. I've only got two months to figure out how I want to redecorate,

153
00:10:12,913 --> 00:10:16,616
if you know what I mean. You know, change the drapes and stuff.

154
00:10:17,669 --> 00:10:21,259
Sure, right this way mr.-- president.

155
00:10:22,368 --> 00:10:25,507
I will need absolute privacy, is that understood?

156
00:10:25,507 --> 00:10:26,522
Yes, sir.

157
00:10:26,522 --> 00:10:27,875
Thanks.

158
00:10:29,981 --> 00:10:31,804
I've got a hundred dollars.

159
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:34,736
Alright, McCaine, I'm in.

160
00:10:34,736 --> 00:10:39,680
Nicely done, B. We're in position outside the Smithsonian. Wou've found the escape tunnel?

161
00:10:39,924 --> 00:10:41,823
I'm already on it.

162
00:10:43,665 --> 00:10:45,357
Boom, baby.

163
00:10:53,703 --> 00:10:58,364
Whooo-- Change-- Change-- Change!

164
00:10:58,364 --> 00:11:00,056
Dad, dad, we have a problem!

165
00:11:00,056 --> 00:11:02,575
Not any more. We do everything different now.

166
00:11:02,575 --> 00:11:04,868
No, dad, we got to take Kyle's brother to the hospital.

167
00:11:04,868 --> 00:11:09,454
We're not take crap for the rich fat cats anymore.

168
00:11:09,774 --> 00:11:11,146
He seems wasted.

169
00:11:11,146 --> 00:11:13,684
Hey, it's my boss. Hey, boss.

170
00:11:14,248 --> 00:11:15,620
Oh, hello Marsh.

171
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:18,609
Yeah, you know what? Fuck you!

172
00:11:18,609 --> 00:11:22,161
- Huh?
- You heared me, you fucking piece of shit.

173
00:11:22,161 --> 00:11:26,109
I can finally tell you what I think you, fucking asshole.

174
00:11:26,109 --> 00:11:27,387
Dad, what are you doing?

175
00:11:27,387 --> 00:11:29,718
It's okay, Stan, everything changed.

176
00:11:29,718 --> 00:11:33,176
I don't need this stupid fucking job anymore.

177
00:11:33,176 --> 00:11:37,161
You're the fucking assfucking piece of shit.

178
00:11:37,161 --> 00:11:40,281
You know what Obama said? Yes, we can.

179
00:11:40,281 --> 00:11:42,612
Hey, I've voted for Obama.

180
00:11:42,612 --> 00:11:45,018
Obama's not talking about you!

181
00:11:45,018 --> 00:11:48,308
Could somebody help us? My little brother fell out of the window.

182
00:11:50,977 --> 00:11:55,845
I just wanna say to everyone who's disappoited with the election

183
00:11:55,845 --> 00:12:01,090
that there's always next year. Maybe I'll run for vice-president again in 2009.

184
00:12:03,402 --> 00:12:06,842
Uh, mrs. Palin, have seen or heared from John McCaine?

185
00:12:06,842 --> 00:12:14,041
Uh, no. I don't really know where he went, kinda seems a little odd, I guess but--

186
00:12:14,041 --> 00:12:17,105
Oh, my phone is going ringy. Excuse me.

187
00:12:18,909 --> 00:12:22,067
- Hello?
- Hello, Sarah, it's McCaine.

188
00:12:22,462 --> 00:12:26,616
I hope to god you're calling to tell me you're in position below the vault with the L7 charges.

189
00:12:26,616 --> 00:12:29,774
I'm in the tunnel now, Sarah. Should be almost below the museum.

190
00:12:29,774 --> 00:12:34,924
Just make sure you won't blow the transformers along with the tunnel, because it will trigger the 54 laser system.

191
00:12:34,924 --> 00:12:40,206
And don't damage any coupling wires or it'll be worthless when Garak shuts down the grade. I'll be there in 30.

192
00:12:40,695 --> 00:12:42,206
God! She's awesome.

193
00:12:43,007 --> 00:12:46,823
Oh, I guess senator McCaine's gonna fly me back to Alaska now.

194
00:12:46,823 --> 00:12:49,943
He's got a private jet, you know. Ok, bye-bye then.

195
00:12:51,954 --> 00:12:54,003
Bloody idiots.

196
00:13:01,503 --> 00:13:03,045
All right, here we go.

197
00:13:06,033 --> 00:13:09,962
- What's that going?
- It's okay, just some construction outside.

198
00:13:20,958 --> 00:13:24,135
McCaine, we've got a problem.

199
00:13:30,375 --> 00:13:32,312
Hang easier, Ike, we gonna get you help.

200
00:13:34,548 --> 00:13:35,864
There's some people.

201
00:13:39,849 --> 00:13:43,421
Let's stay back-- Stay back! We don't have any more room in the ARk.

202
00:13:43,934 --> 00:13:46,666
You have to let us in. You know the country is doomed.

203
00:13:46,666 --> 00:13:48,245
Who are you to turn us away?

204
00:13:48,245 --> 00:13:52,080
I built this bunker in case McCain lost and there isn't enough room for everyone.

205
00:13:52,355 --> 00:13:54,260
Uh, excuse me but we need some help.

206
00:13:54,260 --> 00:13:57,167
I know you do but there's no more room, I tell ya.

207
00:13:57,167 --> 00:13:58,972
You're going to deny them too?

208
00:13:58,972 --> 00:14:01,177
God sakes, man, they're children.

209
00:14:01,177 --> 00:14:04,185
Look them in the eyes and tell them you won't let them in.

210
00:14:04,185 --> 00:14:06,040
Look at their little cheeks.

211
00:14:06,165 --> 00:14:07,919
Let go my face, asshole.

212
00:14:07,919 --> 00:14:09,919
All right, damn you. The children can come in.

213
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:11,919
No, we don't want in to your stupid shelter.

214
00:14:11,919 --> 00:14:14,085
- All right, then I want their place.
- Me too.

215
00:14:14,085 --> 00:14:16,085
We need to get a ride to the hospital.

216
00:14:16,085 --> 00:14:19,348
Damn it, it's gonna be a hospital, don't you get it?

217
00:14:19,348 --> 00:14:21,127
Let us in now!

218
00:14:24,210 --> 00:14:27,744
Oh, Jesus, it's already happening. Society's breaking down.

219
00:14:27,919 --> 00:14:32,180
Obama hasn't been elected 4 hours and already the country's going to hell.

220
00:14:38,571 --> 00:14:41,704
Mr. Obama? Sir?

221
00:14:41,704 --> 00:14:43,358
All right, give me the keys.

222
00:14:45,864 --> 00:14:48,120
Is there a problem, gentlemen?

223
00:14:48,796 --> 00:14:52,030
Eh, no. No, sir. Everything okay in there?

224
00:14:52,030 --> 00:14:55,864
Why wouldn't it be? I'm sorry but I've asked to be left alone.

225
00:14:55,864 --> 00:14:59,423
Yes, sir it's just that-- your wife is here.

226
00:14:59,423 --> 00:15:04,310
- My wife?
- Barack, everyone's been looking for you. What on earth are you doing?

227
00:15:04,310 --> 00:15:07,543
Uh, come on in, darling. Thank-- thank you boys.

228
00:15:10,726 --> 00:15:13,383
Okay, Barack, tell me what's going on.

229
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:17,167
Michelle, there's something I need to tell you.

230
00:15:17,167 --> 00:15:19,167
What is it?

231
00:15:19,749 --> 00:15:22,005
Barack, what is it?

232
00:15:22,305 --> 00:15:26,641
The laser system guarding the diamond has been replaced by an optical relay three days ago.

233
00:15:28,170 --> 00:15:29,974
You gotta be kidding me.

234
00:15:29,974 --> 00:15:34,360
So the entire down in vault is inaccessible? Is McCaine online?

235
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:36,360
Hi, Michelle.

236
00:15:36,842 --> 00:15:39,724
You guys weren't running an update checks on a security logs?

237
00:15:39,724 --> 00:15:43,208
Michelle, we need you to do a different scanhack to the vault relay.

238
00:15:43,208 --> 00:15:45,964
On a new system in an hour? Are you nuts?

239
00:15:45,964 --> 00:15:50,776
My job was to pretend to be married to this bozo and get you three hacks into a laser system.

240
00:15:50,927 --> 00:15:54,962
Michelle, it's Sarah. They did replaced the laser system but the new system isn't brand new.

241
00:15:54,962 --> 00:15:58,596
It's an old H7 series. You can break this baby in 30 minutes.

242
00:15:58,596 --> 00:16:02,907
Huh. Tell Davis to get me a 4-trans emitter and enough poll strive to make a spark.

243
00:16:02,907 --> 00:16:05,463
- You catched this, Davis?
- I'm on it.

244
00:16:09,047 --> 00:16:11,403
We made it, Ike. You're going to be OK.

245
00:16:18,972 --> 00:16:20,877
There. Just take the seat over there.

246
00:16:20,877 --> 00:16:23,859
Excuse me, my little brother need medical attention.

247
00:16:23,859 --> 00:16:26,315
Was he an Obama supporter or McCaine supporter?

248
00:16:26,315 --> 00:16:27,694
Why does that matter?

249
00:16:27,694 --> 00:16:31,278
Because then I'll know if he partied too hard or if he tried to kill himself.

250
00:16:38,270 --> 00:16:40,877
Mam, please. I think my little brother needs immediate help.

251
00:16:41,127 --> 00:16:44,385
You don't understand, kid. There's only two doctors on call.

252
00:16:44,385 --> 00:16:47,293
And dr. Wilson is out celebrating in the street  somewhere.

253
00:16:47,293 --> 00:16:48,746
So, where's the other doctor?

254
00:16:53,408 --> 00:16:57,593
Hey, c'mon, people. We can keep partying, can we?

255
00:16:57,593 --> 00:17:01,002
Yes, we can. C'mon, let's sing.

256
00:17:01,578 --> 00:17:04,285
Ooo-ba-ma.

257
00:17:04,285 --> 00:17:07,944
Well, you came and you gave without taking.

258
00:17:09,573 --> 00:17:12,531
--your way, O-ba-ma.

259
00:17:12,531 --> 00:17:16,365
When you kissed me it's stopped me from shakeing.

260
00:17:19,498 --> 00:17:23,759
I've almost got it. You only going to have five minutes, do you understand?

261
00:17:23,759 --> 00:17:26,365
Did you really not like pretending to be married?

262
00:17:26,365 --> 00:17:28,596
Oh, Jesus, now it's not the time, B.

263
00:17:28,596 --> 00:17:31,052
C'mon, you have to admin we had some fun.

264
00:17:31,052 --> 00:17:33,959
My girls need somebody better than world-class diamond thief.

265
00:17:33,959 --> 00:17:35,563
W-- Wait. There, I've got it.

266
00:17:35,563 --> 00:17:37,092
Alright, everyone, we're about to go.

267
00:17:37,092 --> 00:17:38,621
So, here's the revised schedule.

268
00:17:38,621 --> 00:17:42,130
4:40AM. The team gathers at the north-west exit to the museum.

269
00:17:42,130 --> 00:17:46,666
4:45AM. Michelle hacks the optical relay allowing me access to the rear doors.

270
00:17:46,666 --> 00:17:47,593
Go!

271
00:17:48,771 --> 00:17:52,355
4:46. From inside I can open the doors and let in the rest of the crew.

272
00:17:53,583 --> 00:17:58,170
5:10AM. At the department of power Quincey shuts down the grade disabling power to the vault room.

273
00:17:58,471 --> 00:18:02,481
5:12. My grandmother who faked death on monday calls on a bomb threat to the museum.

274
00:18:02,481 --> 00:18:05,989
I said I put a bomb in your building. Yes.

275
00:18:05,989 --> 00:18:10,050
5:30. The guards open the south-west door checking the museum for any bombs.

276
00:18:10,526 --> 00:18:15,914
5:40. McCaine dressed as a football player enters security and shuts off the diamond case alarm.

277
00:18:21,829 --> 00:18:23,759
Hey you, stop!

278
00:18:24,210 --> 00:18:27,067
Michelle and I head back into the tunnel and the hole is patched.

279
00:18:28,771 --> 00:18:33,533
5:50AM. I walk out of the Oval Office with the diamond securely hidden in my anus.

280
00:18:33,533 --> 00:18:35,533
All done. Thanks.

281
00:18:47,142 --> 00:18:48,771
Boom, baby.

282
00:18:48,997 --> 00:18:50,526
There just one thing.

283
00:18:50,526 --> 00:18:55,037
Don't you think people are going to be suspicious when you disappear? Go looking for you?

284
00:18:55,037 --> 00:18:57,669
We hired a guy for that a couple months ago.

285
00:19:11,754 --> 00:19:12,957
What the hell?

286
00:19:38,872 --> 00:19:40,225
Ike?

287
00:19:40,576 --> 00:19:42,506
Boom, baby.

288
00:19:59,398 --> 00:20:02,531
Here all the tickets for your group, mr. Sanchez.

289
00:20:02,531 --> 00:20:03,984
Thank you very much.

290
00:20:04,335 --> 00:20:06,340
Well, friends, let us depart.

291
00:20:07,468 --> 00:20:10,325
Hey, eh-- You guys go ahead.

292
00:20:10,651 --> 00:20:12,325
I've just came to say goodbye.

293
00:20:12,731 --> 00:20:13,984
What?

294
00:20:14,260 --> 00:20:17,969
I've decided to hang it up. Maybe give this president thing a shot.

295
00:20:17,969 --> 00:20:19,699
B! You can't be serious.

296
00:20:19,699 --> 00:20:23,007
Besides, you died in a jet in Rocky Mountains, remember?

297
00:20:23,233 --> 00:20:25,213
Could have been I didn't make that flight.

298
00:20:25,964 --> 00:20:29,874
What do you say, Michelle? Would you and your girls like to move into the White House with me?

299
00:20:29,874 --> 00:20:33,659
You know, settle down. Just be president and first lady for a while.

300
00:20:34,060 --> 00:20:35,588
You're serious?

301
00:20:35,588 --> 00:20:39,799
Who knows, maybe we could change a few things. What do you say?

302
00:20:39,799 --> 00:20:42,556
Ah, what the fuck.

303
00:20:46,115 --> 00:20:49,022
I just love happy endings.

304
00:20:56,265 --> 00:20:59,749
It's still here. It's all still here.

305
00:21:00,852 --> 00:21:03,909
Does that mean maybe we overreacted?

306
00:21:03,909 --> 00:21:05,909
No, no, I wouldn't say that.

307
00:21:05,909 --> 00:21:08,546
It's just maybe--

308
00:21:08,546 --> 00:21:11,929
Oh, maybe Obama will be alright.

309
00:21:13,809 --> 00:21:18,646
Oh-- Oh, aw-- Aw--

310
00:21:19,122 --> 00:21:21,278
Hey, where are my pants?
