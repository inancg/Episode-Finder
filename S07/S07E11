1
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:36,995
Dude, I wonder where Kyle is.

2
00:00:36,995 --> 00:00:39,206
Maybe he caught a disease and died. That'd be so awesome.

3
00:00:39,206 --> 00:00:40,916
Dude that's not funny. You shouldn't joke about that.

4
00:00:41,416 --> 00:00:42,709
-(Yeah.)
-Who's joking?

5
00:00:43,919 --> 00:00:45,712
You guys! You guys! I have awesome news!

6
00:00:46,088 --> 00:00:46,797
You have AIDS?

7
00:00:47,005 --> 00:00:51,385
No. This Saturday, for my birthday, my Mom says she's takin' me to Casa Bonita, in Denver,

8
00:00:51,385 --> 00:00:53,011
...and I get to invite three friends!.

9
00:00:53,011 --> 00:00:54,388
Wow! Casa Bonita?!

10
00:00:54,388 --> 00:00:55,013
(Woohoo!)

11
00:00:55,097 --> 00:00:56,098
What's Casa Bonita?

12
00:00:56,098 --> 00:00:57,599
Dude, haven't you ever been there?!

13
00:00:57,808 --> 00:01:02,187
It's a big Mexican restaurant where they have, like, cliff jumpers and Black Bart's Cave and  all kinds of stuff!

14
00:01:02,312 --> 00:01:04,106
It's like the Disneyland of Mexican restaurants.

15
00:01:04,106 --> 00:01:05,691
This Saturday! Awesone!

16
00:01:05,691 --> 00:01:10,696
Casa Bonita! Casa Bonita! Food and fun in a festive atmosphere. Casa Bonita!

17
00:01:10,821 --> 00:01:11,613
Who said I'm inviting you?

18
00:01:13,782 --> 00:01:16,493
You... your Mom said you could take three friends.

19
00:01:16,493 --> 00:01:18,704
Yes. Three friends. You're not my friend.

20
00:01:18,704 --> 00:01:21,999
Wuh ih uh... Weh come on, Kyle, who the hell else are you gonna take besides Stan and Kenny?

21
00:01:22,207 --> 00:01:25,294
I'm gonna take Butters. He invited me to his birthday party last month, so I owe him one.

22
00:01:25,419 --> 00:01:28,088
Butters?! You're gonna take THAT butthole?! Why?!

23
00:01:28,088 --> 00:01:29,798
Because Butters isn't a total dick to me!

24
00:01:29,882 --> 00:01:31,383
I have never been a dick to you.

25
00:01:32,217 --> 00:01:35,095
Oh please! All you ever do is call me names and rip on me for being Jewish!

26
00:01:35,095 --> 00:01:37,514
Kyle, when have I ever ripped on you for being a Jew?

27
00:01:37,514 --> 00:01:39,391
Oh yeah?! Well you're a stupid Jew!

28
00:01:39,516 --> 00:01:40,100
You're a Jew!

29
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:41,393
Shut your God-damned Jew mouth!

30
00:01:41,393 --> 00:01:42,311
Good job, Jew!

31
00:01:42,394 --> 00:01:43,103
Jew...

32
00:01:43,103 --> 00:01:43,896
Shutup Jew!

33
00:01:44,021 --> 00:01:44,813
You're Jewish!!

34
00:01:44,813 --> 00:01:45,397
Dude, he's Jewish!

35
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:45,981
Jew!

36
00:01:45,981 --> 00:01:46,398
Jew!

37
00:01:46,481 --> 00:01:46,815
Jew!

38
00:01:46,815 --> 00:01:47,191
Jew!

39
00:01:47,316 --> 00:01:47,691
Jew!

40
00:01:47,691 --> 00:01:48,108
Jew!

41
00:01:48,108 --> 00:01:48,483
Jew?!

42
00:01:48,483 --> 00:01:50,819
-I told you Jewish people don't have rhythm.
-Fuck off, Cartman

43
00:01:52,779 --> 00:01:54,615
Okay, except maybe for that one time.

44
00:01:54,615 --> 00:01:56,783
You've always been a dick to me, Cartman, and I'm not inviting you.

45
00:01:56,783 --> 00:02:01,079
Kyle, you don't understand! Casa Bonita is my most favorite place in the whole world.

46
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:03,207
I'll just, I'll just die if you don't take me! Please!

47
00:02:03,207 --> 00:02:04,499
Sorry, my mind's made up.

48
00:02:06,084 --> 00:02:09,296
Well fuck you, Kyle!! I don't wanna go to your faggy birthday party anyway!

49
00:02:09,296 --> 00:02:12,382
I'd much rather hang out at home than have to be around you and your Jew mom for a day!

50
00:02:12,382 --> 00:02:14,301
Kiss my ball, asshole!!

51
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:20,015
Dude, I totally didn't mean that, Kyle.

52
00:02:20,015 --> 00:02:22,184
Ah I really really wanna go to Casa Bonita.

53
00:02:22,184 --> 00:02:23,810
I'm sorry we had that fight just now.

54
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:27,689
You know, I mean, I said some things, you said some things, but, I think it was good and we we've moved past it.

55
00:02:27,689 --> 00:02:28,982
I'm not inviting you to Casa Bonita.

56
00:02:29,816 --> 00:02:33,987
Well fuck you, Kyle!! I hope you die! I hope you fucking die!

57
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:45,082
Casa Bonita! Come on, you guys!

58
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:48,085
Oh, awesome!!

59
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:50,879
Come on, you guys! Black Bart's Cave!

60
00:02:52,297 --> 00:02:54,591
Wow, cliff divers!

61
00:02:56,093 --> 00:02:58,095
More sopapillas, please!

62
00:03:01,682 --> 00:03:03,392
I'm not inviting you, Cartman. You can't go.

63
00:03:03,517 --> 00:03:09,606
No! Noooo!  Casa Bonita! Noooo!

64
00:03:11,817 --> 00:03:17,614
Oh... God-damnit, I have to get invited to go! I'm just gonna have to start being nice to Kyle!

65
00:03:21,493 --> 00:03:22,286
Hi Kyle.

66
00:03:23,996 --> 00:03:25,289
That isn't it, Cartman.

67
00:03:25,581 --> 00:03:26,415
What isn't it?

68
00:03:26,498 --> 00:03:29,585
That's not being nice! That's just putting on a nice sweater!

69
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:32,588
...I don't understand the difference.

70
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:34,381
I know you don't.

71
00:03:39,511 --> 00:03:41,096
Jimmy! Hey Jimmy, wait up!

72
00:03:41,388 --> 00:03:43,015
Dude, uh I need your help on something.

73
00:03:43,015 --> 00:03:46,310
Well, sure, Eric. W-w-waht seems to be the p-p-p-prrroblem?

74
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:49,313
Well, everybody likes you, Jimmy, a-and you seem to be really good with people, so,

75
00:03:49,313 --> 00:03:52,191
I was wondering if you could tell me, how "do" you act nice to people?

76
00:03:52,316 --> 00:03:56,486
Well, the best thing is not to act nice, Eric. Uh, the best thing is to be genuinely nice.

77
00:03:56,486 --> 00:03:58,697
Okay, so how do you act genuinely nice to people?

78
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:01,909
Well, Eric, pah part of being nice is just making people smile and laugh.

79
00:04:01,909 --> 00:04:08,707
The best way to do that is by telling a fan-tastic joke or a humorius anti-d- ant'duhh ...antecdote.

80
00:04:08,916 --> 00:04:09,708
Like what?

81
00:04:09,791 --> 00:04:12,294
Well, like, try this one on for size: Knock knock.

82
00:04:12,419 --> 00:04:13,212
Who's there?

83
00:04:13,212 --> 00:04:15,297
Ing-mar ...Bergman.

84
00:04:18,008 --> 00:04:20,385
Now you say, "Ingmar Bergman who?"

85
00:04:21,386 --> 00:04:25,098
Take that, Jimmy!  And that! And don't you ever talk bad about Kyle again!

86
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:28,519
Kyle is my friend! And if you say you had sex with his mom one more time,

87
00:04:28,519 --> 00:04:30,604
I'm gonna really let you have it! You hear me?!

88
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:33,190
Oh, Kyle. Hey.

89
00:04:34,983 --> 00:04:37,319
Do you really think that beating up a handicapped kid is being nice?

90
00:04:41,615 --> 00:04:44,618
Uh...  He-hey Kyle! Knock knock. Knock knock, Kyle!

91
00:04:53,418 --> 00:04:55,087
Yeah, Casa Bonita, this Saturday!

92
00:04:55,087 --> 00:04:56,797
Wow, that's gonna be so fun!

93
00:04:56,797 --> 00:04:58,882
Yeah, it'll be awesome. Just the four of us.

94
00:04:58,882 --> 00:04:59,591
(Yeah!)

95
00:05:07,182 --> 00:05:08,016
Hey Kyle.

96
00:05:08,016 --> 00:05:08,684
Well?

97
00:05:08,684 --> 00:05:09,393
Well what?

98
00:05:09,393 --> 00:05:11,520
How are you going to try to get invited to Casa Bonita this time?

99
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:14,189
I'm not, Kyle. I know you already told Butters he could go.

100
00:05:14,606 --> 00:05:16,692
Oh. Well... yeah. I, I did.

101
00:05:16,692 --> 00:05:21,280
So, fine, Kyle, but honestly, I never meant to make you feel like you didn't matter at all to me.

102
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:26,118
I know we argue all the time and I give you tons of crap, but we've also been through a, a lot together, and...

103
00:05:26,410 --> 00:05:29,913
maybe that alone doesn't make us friends, but it makes us something.

104
00:05:29,913 --> 00:05:34,001
So, ...whatever, you know, just... ah I hope... things will be cool.

105
00:05:37,504 --> 00:05:39,089
I'm still not inviting you to Casa Bonita.

106
00:05:39,214 --> 00:05:41,592
I know, Kyle. I'll see ya later.

107
00:05:44,094 --> 00:05:45,387
Eh... hey, Cartman?

108
00:05:45,387 --> 00:05:48,599
You really don't care that you can't go?

109
00:05:48,599 --> 00:05:52,811
I care, sure, but I hope it doesn't mean you and me and Stan and Kenny can't hang out anymore.

110
00:05:52,895 --> 00:05:55,314
That's exactly what I wanted to hear from you all along.

111
00:05:55,314 --> 00:05:58,483
Ah uh I still have to take Butters, but... I hope things can be cool too.

112
00:05:58,692 --> 00:05:59,401
Good.

113
00:05:59,484 --> 00:06:03,697
And, and hey, if for some reason Butters can't go to Casa Bonita, you can take his place.

114
00:06:03,697 --> 00:06:04,781
Sweet, whatever.

115
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:07,618
Bingo!

116
00:06:09,494 --> 00:06:11,079
What's this all about, Eric?

117
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:12,414
Butters, can you keep a secret?

118
00:06:12,414 --> 00:06:13,498
Well, sure I can!

119
00:06:13,582 --> 00:06:16,710
For the past five days I've been looking out into space for a school project.

120
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:20,714
This morning, at 3:45 a.m. I... caught first sight of something terrible.

121
00:06:20,797 --> 00:06:21,798
Nnn-how terrible?

122
00:06:22,299 --> 00:06:25,886
A meteor. A meteor the size of Wyoming, heading right for earth.

123
00:06:26,011 --> 00:06:26,720
What??

124
00:06:26,803 --> 00:06:29,515
Now look, ah I could be wrong. I ...pray that I'm wrong, but,

125
00:06:29,515 --> 00:06:32,100
I just want you to take a look and... see what you think.

126
00:06:34,019 --> 00:06:35,312
Do you see anything?

127
00:06:35,312 --> 00:06:36,605
I just see stars.

128
00:06:36,605 --> 00:06:39,399
Keep looking. Sometimes it takes your eyes a minute to adjust.

129
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:40,817
Nope, uh I don't see any...

130
00:06:40,817 --> 00:06:45,614
Oh wait. Oh my God! I see it. I see it! It's a meteor! Oh my God!

131
00:06:45,614 --> 00:06:47,783
Oh my God! Does it look like it's getting closer?

132
00:06:49,993 --> 00:06:52,913
It is! It is getting clsoer! Oh my God!

133
00:06:52,913 --> 00:06:56,416
Oh my God! That meteor is the size of Wyoming and it's on a collision course for Earth.

134
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:57,793
When do you think uh it'll get here?

135
00:06:57,793 --> 00:07:00,587
I, I don't know, I, have to do some calculations.

136
00:07:00,587 --> 00:07:06,802
10 to the power of 1 base 9 divided by pi plus 5 minus 3.

137
00:07:07,302 --> 00:07:08,512
-Oh Jesus.
-What??

138
00:07:08,512 --> 00:07:11,682
According to my calculations, that meteor is going to hit Earth in less than four hours.

139
00:07:11,682 --> 00:07:13,100
Oh, you mean we're gonna die?!

140
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:16,395
No! No, Butters, we are going to live! Do you hear me?! We are going to live!

141
00:07:16,395 --> 00:07:18,480
We just... We've gotta find a bomb shelter!

142
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:20,607
Wha...? Where is there a bomb shelter??

143
00:07:20,607 --> 00:07:23,902
Stan's Uncle Jimbo! He has a bomb shelter in his back yard! Come on, Butters! Hurry!

144
00:07:25,988 --> 00:07:29,408
-Here we go! The bomb shelter's down here!
-Oh God! Oh Jesus!

145
00:07:31,118 --> 00:07:32,911
All right, we should be safe in here.

146
00:07:32,911 --> 00:07:34,997
This dried food and water should last us for weeks.

147
00:07:35,581 --> 00:07:38,292
But what about everyone else? I have to tell my parents so they can come here, too.

148
00:07:38,292 --> 00:07:41,420
No! Butters! I can't let you risk it.
I'll go up and get the others.

149
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:42,212
Are you sure?

150
00:07:42,504 --> 00:07:43,881
I'm not sure of anythng anymore.

151
00:07:47,718 --> 00:07:51,597
Now Butters, listen: No matter what happens, no matter what you hear, do not come out!

152
00:07:51,597 --> 00:07:55,893
If I don't make it back in time with the others, then it will be up to you to repopulate the Earth.

153
00:07:55,893 --> 00:07:58,687
But I'm the only one down here. What am I supposed to repopulate with?

154
00:07:58,687 --> 00:08:01,106
Well, you know, with your wiener.

155
00:08:02,691 --> 00:08:04,818
Just stay down here until you hear word from me.

156
00:08:04,818 --> 00:08:07,779
And... pray, Butters... pray for all mankind.

157
00:08:11,992 --> 00:08:13,493
Oh God, oh God!

158
00:08:16,205 --> 00:08:18,582
Where is Butters? We were supposed to leave here forty minutes ago.

159
00:08:18,582 --> 00:08:21,710
Well I think we better just go without him, Kyle. It's getting late.

160
00:08:21,793 --> 00:08:25,297
Yeah, screw him. Let's go.  Oh, finally!

161
00:08:27,299 --> 00:08:30,093
Happy Birthday, Kyle. I just wanted to stop by and give you your present.

162
00:08:30,219 --> 00:08:31,803
Oh. Thanks, dude.

163
00:08:31,803 --> 00:08:33,305
Hope you have a good one. See you later.

164
00:08:34,515 --> 00:08:35,307
Oh wait. Cartman.

165
00:08:35,891 --> 00:08:36,683
Yes?

166
00:08:37,601 --> 00:08:40,020
Uh Butters didn't show. You wanna go to Casa Bonita with us?

167
00:08:40,604 --> 00:08:41,396
Butters didn't show?

168
00:08:41,897 --> 00:08:44,816
I I can't believe it. Uh are you sure you told him the right time and everything?

169
00:08:44,816 --> 00:08:46,693
I told him 5:30 and we gotta get going. You in?

170
00:08:46,693 --> 00:08:48,987
Well I... really would need to go home first and get my...

171
00:08:48,987 --> 00:08:51,406
Weh no no, I guess I have everything I need. Oh, okay, sure.

172
00:08:51,406 --> 00:08:52,282
All right, let's go.

173
00:08:52,282 --> 00:08:53,909
Okay, boys. Get in the car.

174
00:08:53,909 --> 00:08:55,410
Casa Bonita, here we come!

175
00:08:56,286 --> 00:08:57,996
Oh, hello Chris, Linda.

176
00:08:57,996 --> 00:09:01,416
Hello everyone. Have any of you seen our son?

177
00:09:03,001 --> 00:09:04,795
Butters was supposed to go with us to Casa Bonita tonight.

178
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:08,382
We know, but... he hasn't been home since last night.

179
00:09:08,382 --> 00:09:10,592
The police have been looking everywhere, but...

180
00:09:12,219 --> 00:09:16,598
Well, thank you. Uh, please, let us know if you find out anything.

181
00:09:20,102 --> 00:09:20,894
Aw dude, weak.

182
00:09:21,311 --> 00:09:24,314
Yeah. Man, that sucks about Butters.
Well, let's get going, shall we?

183
00:09:24,314 --> 00:09:27,985
Nah. Dude, I c-I can't go to have a birthday party while Butters is missing.

184
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:29,111
Yeah, it's kinda weird.

185
00:09:29,987 --> 00:09:32,990
Ee-yeah yeah. I think you're right, but, on the other hand,

186
00:09:32,990 --> 00:09:35,617
I think Butters would want us to go. You know Butters...

187
00:09:35,701 --> 00:09:37,786
Nah, I can't. We should help look for him.

188
00:09:37,911 --> 00:09:38,495
Yeah.

189
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:42,416
That's very good of you, boys. We can postpone Casa Bonita until next Saturday.

190
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:45,294
Next Saturday?? I'll never be able to keep Butters in the...

191
00:09:46,003 --> 00:09:48,380
In the... depths of my heart for that long.

192
00:09:48,505 --> 00:09:50,716
I sure hope he... turns up before then.

193
00:09:50,716 --> 00:09:52,593
Dude, we should check over at Stark's Pond. Butters always hangs out over there.

194
00:09:52,718 --> 00:09:54,303
Yeah. And then we can try the football field.

195
00:09:54,303 --> 00:09:55,512
I'll drive you boys.

196
00:09:57,598 --> 00:10:01,393
Oh, God-damnit! How am I gonna keep Butters down in that bomb shelter for a whole week?!

197
00:10:06,398 --> 00:10:09,109
All right, folks, this is the little boy we're looking for:

198
00:10:09,109 --> 00:10:12,321
Leopold Stotch, also known as Butters.

199
00:10:12,321 --> 00:10:16,909
He's been missing for two days and was last seen at the school. Let's go find him.

200
00:10:21,914 --> 00:10:25,918
"Dried food rations. Add water to feed flavored square..."

201
00:10:26,793 --> 00:10:29,004
Hello? Hello??

202
00:10:30,797 --> 00:10:31,798
Butters!

203
00:10:32,591 --> 00:10:35,385
Butters! Oh God, it was... It was horrible!

204
00:10:35,385 --> 00:10:37,095
Wuh, wait, well, what happened??

205
00:10:37,095 --> 00:10:42,017
The meteor... struck the Earth sooner than I predicted. There was no time... no time...

206
00:10:42,893 --> 00:10:44,603
What about my parents. Did you see them?

207
00:10:44,686 --> 00:10:46,605
There was mass confusion! Pa... panic!

208
00:10:46,605 --> 00:10:49,191
People were crawling all over each other in the streets! It was... awful!

209
00:10:49,191 --> 00:10:52,319
When it hit, millions were evaporated instantly.

210
00:10:52,319 --> 00:10:55,781
The rest of us... walking around in a... cloud of... toxic... radiation.

211
00:10:56,907 --> 00:10:58,116
Oh my God, let me see!

212
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:00,702
No Butters!! If you come up, you'll get infected too!

213
00:11:00,702 --> 00:11:02,996
You best wait for the radiatino level to go down.

214
00:11:02,996 --> 00:11:06,500
Probably... next week sometime. After Saturday. Ugh...

215
00:11:07,084 --> 00:11:09,419
How many survivors are there? You should all come down here.

216
00:11:09,419 --> 00:11:12,089
We can't come down there, or else, we'll contaminate you, Butters.

217
00:11:12,089 --> 00:11:15,217
No... we just have to survive the best we can.

218
00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:21,014
Wow... Eric, I can never thank you enough for everything you've done for me.

219
00:11:21,515 --> 00:11:25,811
Thank me by living, Butters. Live. And... rebuild.

220
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:31,608
I've got to go. Remember, wait one week for the toxic levels to go down. On Saturday.

221
00:11:31,608 --> 00:11:32,985
G-goodbye!

222
00:11:35,404 --> 00:11:38,282
All right. Just six days, Butters. Sit tight.

223
00:11:39,616 --> 00:11:43,620
Tom, it has now been three days since the Stotch child has gone missing.

224
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:46,790
Townspeople continue to search, but hope... is dwindling.

225
00:11:46,915 --> 00:11:49,585
All right, folks. I wanna thank you for all your efforts.

226
00:11:49,585 --> 00:11:53,505
Three days is a long time, but we've got to keep going if we're gonna find him.

227
00:11:53,505 --> 00:11:59,011
Heh you're not going to find him. Not until after Saturday when I go to Casa Bonita.

228
00:12:05,517 --> 00:12:08,812
Many times in cases like these a child can trap themselves.

229
00:12:08,812 --> 00:12:12,691
It is important that we spread our search to duct pipes, wells, and bomb shelters.

230
00:12:15,194 --> 00:12:16,195
What what what?

231
00:12:17,196 --> 00:12:20,282
I say we need to move the search to ducts, wells, and bomb shelters.

232
00:12:20,282 --> 00:12:23,202
Let's move out, people! Every second counts!

233
00:12:26,914 --> 00:12:31,502
But if you leave me now, you'll take away the biggest part of me.

234
00:12:31,502 --> 00:12:35,714
Oo-oo-ooooo-oo girl, baby please don't go. Eh,

235
00:12:35,797 --> 00:12:37,716
Oo-oo-ooooo-oo girl-

236
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,594
Eric?  Eric, is that you?

237
00:12:40,719 --> 00:12:43,514
Oh God! They're coming! They're coming!

238
00:12:43,514 --> 00:12:45,307
We'be gotta get out of here! They're coming this way!

239
00:12:45,390 --> 00:12:46,183
Who's coming this way?

240
00:12:46,183 --> 00:12:48,101
The cannibals! Don't you know?

241
00:12:48,101 --> 00:12:52,397
The meteor destroyed all of society, Butters. Now Earth is ruled by packs of wild humans gone mad!

242
00:12:52,397 --> 00:12:55,609
Those of us who survived are now being hunted by flesh-starved cannibals!

243
00:12:55,609 --> 00:12:56,985
Oh God! I hate cannibals!

244
00:12:56,985 --> 00:12:59,279
They're coming this way! I can hear them.

245
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:02,699
They'll find you down here for sure. And when they do, they'll eat you alive.

246
00:13:02,699 --> 00:13:03,116
Noooo!

247
00:13:03,116 --> 00:13:04,701
We've gotta get you out of here! Come on!

248
00:13:04,701 --> 00:13:07,412
Oh oh no wait, I forgot! The toxic radiation!

249
00:13:07,412 --> 00:13:10,207
Hey wait! We can use this box!  There we go.

250
00:13:10,207 --> 00:13:12,000
This should keep you protected from the toxins.

251
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,502
But I can't see nothin'.

252
00:13:13,502 --> 00:13:16,004
Believe me, Butters, you don't wanna see what's up there.

253
00:13:16,004 --> 00:13:18,507
Now come on. I'll guide you to a safer location.

254
00:13:19,716 --> 00:13:22,010
There you go. Two more steps and you're at the top.

255
00:13:22,594 --> 00:13:23,387
Good.

256
00:13:23,387 --> 00:13:24,680
Are we out in the destruction?

257
00:13:24,805 --> 00:13:27,683
Yes. There's nothing but smoldering bodies all around you.

258
00:13:27,683 --> 00:13:30,018
Burnt out buildings, and what used to be our town.

259
00:13:30,102 --> 00:13:30,602
Aw man.

260
00:13:30,686 --> 00:13:33,105
All right, this way, Butters. Just follow the sound of my voice.

261
00:13:34,690 --> 00:13:36,817
Right now we're walking by what used to be people's houses,

262
00:13:36,817 --> 00:13:38,610
...now just smoldering burnt piles of rubble.

263
00:13:38,610 --> 00:13:40,612
Huh... Oh, it's terrible.

264
00:13:40,696 --> 00:13:42,781
We're coming now to the crater where the meteor hit.

265
00:13:42,781 --> 00:13:44,783
A hole in the Earth over two miles in diameter.

266
00:13:44,908 --> 00:13:47,995
Whoa!

267
00:13:47,995 --> 00:13:51,290
Here we are at the old gas station. It survived a lot of the impact. We might be safe here.

268
00:13:53,417 --> 00:13:54,293
Oh my God!

269
00:13:54,293 --> 00:13:54,710
Whaaat??

270
00:13:54,710 --> 00:13:57,087
It's a cannibal! Stay back, cannibal!

271
00:14:00,299 --> 00:14:01,216
We've got to fight them off!

272
00:14:02,384 --> 00:14:04,720
Stay away from Butters! He's humanity's last hope!

273
00:14:06,597 --> 00:14:09,099
Awww! He bit me! He bit off my hand!!

274
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:13,604
Aw man, he's eating my hand like a piece of chicken! Can you hear the bones crack?

275
00:14:17,399 --> 00:14:19,902
Wait! Look here! There's a dead body with an axe in the back.

276
00:14:19,902 --> 00:14:22,487
I'll pull out the axe and use it to chop off the cannibal's head. Hunh!

277
00:14:23,906 --> 00:14:25,115
Die!

278
00:14:26,491 --> 00:14:28,285
Ooooh, what happened? What happened?!

279
00:14:29,411 --> 00:14:31,997
The cannibal! The cannibal's dead, Butters!

280
00:14:31,997 --> 00:14:35,209
But he bit me, which means soon I will have a taste for human flesh as well.

281
00:14:35,292 --> 00:14:36,084
Oh no!

282
00:14:36,210 --> 00:14:38,795
We have no choice, Butters! We have to lock you away somewhere where even I can't get to you!

283
00:14:38,795 --> 00:14:39,588
Uh w-where??

284
00:14:40,214 --> 00:14:41,507
Look! There's an old refrigerator!

285
00:14:42,591 --> 00:14:45,219
Get inside, Butters! I'll break off the handle so nobody can get to you!

286
00:14:45,302 --> 00:14:46,220
Aren't you coming?

287
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:49,598
Too late for me. I can already feel my... body start to... change.

288
00:14:49,598 --> 00:14:51,892
No! Must... fight... it...

289
00:14:53,393 --> 00:14:57,981
Don't open this door for anybody, Butters! No matter what you hear, stay inside for four days!

290
00:14:57,981 --> 00:14:59,983
Here's some water and food from the shelter.

291
00:14:59,983 --> 00:15:04,905
Eric, you're the ...best friend in the whole world. I... I love you.

292
00:15:04,905 --> 00:15:06,907
I love you too, man.

293
00:15:07,908 --> 00:15:10,994
I just You look so delicious! Must eat your brains!

294
00:15:32,307 --> 00:15:34,601
It's Wednesday! It's Wednesday!

295
00:15:35,310 --> 00:15:38,313
Only three more days till Casa Bonita.

296
00:15:38,313 --> 00:15:41,984
I'm gonna go through Black Bart's Cave first. No! I'm gonna watch the cliff divers first!

297
00:15:41,984 --> 00:15:45,112
Maybe if I tell them it's my birthday, they'll let me cliff-dive in the pool!

298
00:15:45,112 --> 00:15:46,989
Oh, that would be so bad-ass!

299
00:15:58,917 --> 00:16:00,419
Finally I can breathe a-

300
00:16:00,919 --> 00:16:02,004
Oh my God.

301
00:16:03,297 --> 00:16:05,716
Oh my God, the meteor took out everything!

302
00:16:07,509 --> 00:16:10,012
It's all destroyed. Nothingn left.

303
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:14,892
Hello? Are there any, are there any other survivors?

304
00:16:16,101 --> 00:16:21,481
Hello? Oh. That must have been where the library was. And that was probably the school.

305
00:16:21,481 --> 00:16:22,482
Hello?

306
00:16:23,483 --> 00:16:26,695
Oh. I forgot, I gotta watch out for readioactive cannibals.

307
00:16:28,697 --> 00:16:32,117
Is that a cannibal? Sir? Ma'am?

308
00:16:35,287 --> 00:16:39,791
Oh. Aww, it's a little dog.  Well, hello there, Mr. Dog.

309
00:16:39,791 --> 00:16:44,004
Looks like you and me are the only ones who survive the meteor, heh. We should stick together, huh, Mr. Dog?

310
00:16:44,004 --> 00:16:48,509
Well come on, we gotta start cleanin' up this mess, and rebuild this civilization.

311
00:16:48,509 --> 00:16:51,595
Boy, that meteor sure did make everything stinky.

312
00:16:55,891 --> 00:16:59,394
We're on our way to Casa Bonita! We're gonna be there very soon.

313
00:16:59,394 --> 00:17:01,313
You're gonna love Casa Bonita, Stan.

314
00:17:01,313 --> 00:17:05,692
There, there's this one part where you can dress up in Old Western clothes and get your photo taken in a fake jail.

315
00:17:05,692 --> 00:17:06,693
Really?

316
00:17:06,693 --> 00:17:08,695
-Yeah, it's pretty cool.
-"Pretty cool."

317
00:17:08,695 --> 00:17:11,114
So, um, should we go to Black Bart's Cave first or watch the puppet show?

318
00:17:11,114 --> 00:17:14,409
I think we should go through Black Bart's Cave right away 'cause, we're gonna wanna do it seven or eight times.

319
00:17:14,409 --> 00:17:16,620
And then we'll watch the cliff divers before the puppet show.

320
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:18,497
Dude, it's Kyle's birthday. We should do whatever he wants to do.

321
00:17:18,914 --> 00:17:20,207
What? Fuck Kyle.

322
00:17:23,085 --> 00:17:25,796
Ha ha, j-just kidding, birthday joke.

323
00:17:25,796 --> 00:17:28,799
Of course we'll do whatever Kyle wants, uh. Happy Birthday, Kyle.

324
00:17:28,882 --> 00:17:31,718
Happy Birthday to you. Happy-

325
00:17:31,718 --> 00:17:39,309
Birthday to you. Happy Birthday dear Kyle. Happy Birthday to you. .

326
00:17:44,690 --> 00:17:50,612
You take away the biggest part of me.  Woo-oo-ooooo-oo-oo, uh baby please don't go.

327
00:17:52,406 --> 00:17:56,201
Woo-oo-ooooo-oo-oo, I just had to find my say to you tan...

328
00:17:56,285 --> 00:17:56,618
Hello?

329
00:17:56,618 --> 00:17:59,204
HAAAAGH! Who are you? Are you infected?

330
00:17:59,705 --> 00:18:00,289
With what?

331
00:18:00,414 --> 00:18:01,707
You're not a cannibal, are you?

332
00:18:02,916 --> 00:18:03,500
No

333
00:18:03,584 --> 00:18:06,712
Oh.  Oh good. You're a survivor, like me.

334
00:18:06,712 --> 00:18:09,506
Look, Mr. Dog, another survivor. And it's a lady, too.

335
00:18:09,506 --> 00:18:11,884
That means we can repopulate the earth. Yippee!

336
00:18:13,510 --> 00:18:14,720
Kid, what are you doin' here?

337
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:17,681
I'm rebuilding society. Here, take a look.

338
00:18:18,891 --> 00:18:21,101
This is the library, and over here is the bank.

339
00:18:21,101 --> 00:18:24,479
That over there I'm thinking into a P.F. Chang's or a Bennigan's.

340
00:18:24,479 --> 00:18:29,902
And this  is a memorial to Eric Cartman, the person who gave his life so that I could rebuild society.

341
00:18:29,902 --> 00:18:32,988
Well ma'am, I guess we should start repopulatin' the earth, huh?

342
00:18:35,282 --> 00:18:37,117
I'm ready whenever you are.

343
00:18:37,993 --> 00:18:42,206
Kid, I don't know what you think is going on, but this place is a dump.

344
00:18:42,206 --> 00:18:46,084
Hey, that's not very nice! This is my first society! I'm doin' my best!

345
00:18:46,084 --> 00:18:49,004
No, I mean you're at the garbage dump.

346
00:18:49,004 --> 00:18:54,510
The town is right over there, everybody is fine, and I think they've been looking for you for over a week.

347
00:19:04,019 --> 00:19:06,897
Oh...  Ma'am, can I use your phone?

348
00:19:07,689 --> 00:19:10,317
We're here! We're here! Casa Bonita!

349
00:19:11,401 --> 00:19:13,320
Aw man, this is gonna be so great!

350
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:15,781
Wait up, Eric. We need to stay together.

351
00:19:15,781 --> 00:19:18,116
Uh, hold on boys, that's my cell phone.

352
00:19:19,117 --> 00:19:21,495
Hello? Yes.

353
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:23,497
Oh, that's great!

354
00:19:23,497 --> 00:19:25,791
Boys, they found Butters.  He's okay.

355
00:19:25,791 --> 00:19:26,500
Oh, awesome.

356
00:19:26,792 --> 00:19:27,501
I knew he'd turn up.

357
00:19:27,584 --> 00:19:33,090
Yes, Eric Cartman is with us. Why?  Oh really?

358
00:19:33,090 --> 00:19:34,007
What?

359
00:19:34,007 --> 00:19:36,802
Yes, I will certainly let him know. Thank you.

360
00:19:37,886 --> 00:19:43,392
Well, it appears that Eric here is responsible for Butters missing, because he wanted to go to Casa Bonita.

361
00:19:43,392 --> 00:19:44,101
What?

362
00:19:44,101 --> 00:19:48,188
Eric, the South Park Police are already on their way here to have a little talk with you!

363
00:19:48,188 --> 00:19:49,690
But... Casa Bonita.

364
00:19:49,815 --> 00:19:52,901
I should have known better! You never cared about my birthday at all!

365
00:19:53,110 --> 00:19:54,486
But I...  but...

366
00:19:54,820 --> 00:19:55,821
Stand back!

367
00:19:56,196 --> 00:19:56,780
Cartman, stop it!

368
00:19:56,905 --> 00:20:00,200
I... am going... to Casa... Bonita!

369
00:20:01,285 --> 00:20:03,495
It's too late, fatass. They'll be here in less than a minute.

370
00:20:06,582 --> 00:20:08,083
Less than a minute! Less than a minute!

371
00:20:08,792 --> 00:20:09,293
Cartman!

372
00:20:12,212 --> 00:20:13,589
Oh, awesome!!

373
00:20:13,589 --> 00:20:17,718
Excuse me, excuse me? Can I get to eat some of your- Thank you. Thank you.

374
00:20:19,511 --> 00:20:21,180
Oh, I've got to get to Black Bart's Cave!

375
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:24,016
Ah! Excuse me? Excuse me! Coming through to Black Bart's Cave!

376
00:20:24,016 --> 00:20:27,811
Oh! Oh, scary! Look, a skeleton!  Oh man, I'm so scared!

377
00:20:28,687 --> 00:20:31,899
Oh! Oh! Oh, that was awesome! Oh! Oh! Cliff divers!

378
00:20:36,904 --> 00:20:38,488
Come on! Come on, dive!

379
00:20:39,615 --> 00:20:41,200
Dive, asshole!

380

Oh, awesome! That was cool, huh?

Sopapillas! Can I get some sopapillas please?! Sweeet!

All right, kid! End of the line!

385
00:21:12,105 --> 00:21:14,107
Yeeeesss!

386
00:21:14,107 --> 00:21:14,900
Jesus Christ!

387
00:21:23,992 --> 00:21:30,415
Well kid, you made an entire town panic, you lost all your friends, and now you're going to Juvenile Hall for a week! Huh,

388
00:21:30,415 --> 00:21:32,501
