1
00:00:35,285 --> 00:00:37,955
"Ladies and Gentlemen, give it up for JIMMY!

2
00:00:38,539 --> 00:00:40,666
Thank you! Wow. What a terrific audience.

3
00:00:40,832 --> 00:00:44,211
I know what most of you are thinking.
"Hey, uh-that guy stole my show..."

4
00:00:46,547 --> 00:00:49,675
Wow, what a great audience.
And how about this Michael Jackson guy, huh?

5
00:00:49,842 --> 00:00:56,598
I mean, come on...  Wow, what a great
audience.  Uh... l... lights, please?

6
00:00:59,601 --> 00:01:00,561
Hey Jimmy.

7
00:01:01,186 --> 00:01:03,105
Butters, w-where is everybody?

8
00:01:03,272 --> 00:01:04,940
Oh yeah, well, about that...

9
00:01:05,399 --> 00:01:09,278
Christopher Reeve came to town to do some
kind of show, and everyone went to see him.

10
00:01:09,653 --> 00:01:12,281
Christopher Reeve? Christopher Reeve?!

11
00:01:12,322 --> 00:01:14,241
You know, Christopher Reeve, the guy who played Superman.

12
00:01:14,241 --> 00:01:17,286
I know who he is! But why is everyone
ditching my comedy show to see him?!

13
00:01:17,536 --> 00:01:20,539
Ww-well, because he got crippled,
but now he can move his finger.

14
00:01:20,539 --> 00:01:24,126
He is an inspiration to us all.
That's why everyone ditched on your show.

15
00:01:24,793 --> 00:01:26,086
So then, how come you came?

16
00:01:26,837 --> 00:01:31,091
Well, because I said I would. Oh, I'm a dork, huh?

17
00:01:33,468 --> 00:01:36,054
And so without further ado, here's the most courageous,

18
00:01:36,054 --> 00:01:39,057
most amazing man on the planet, Christopher Reeve.

19
00:01:44,605 --> 00:01:46,857
Thank you, thank you, wow, what a great audience.

20
00:01:49,026 --> 00:01:50,819
I just flew into South Park.

21
00:01:52,821 --> 00:01:54,281
Used to be I didn't need an airplane.

22
00:01:57,075 --> 00:01:58,160
As most of you know,

23
00:02:00,704 --> 00:02:03,081
I am a strong supporter of stem-cell research.

24
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:06,043
Say, fellas! Thanks a lot for goin' to my ...c-comedy show!

25
00:02:06,752 --> 00:02:07,920
We didn't go to your comedy show.

26
00:02:08,045 --> 00:02:11,048
I know that, I was being f-f-f-fa...cetious!

27
00:02:11,632 --> 00:02:13,300
Look, dude. Christopher Reeve, dude.

28
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:15,594
Ooh, Christopher Reeve! Whoop-de-freakin-do!

29
00:02:15,844 --> 00:02:17,930
Dude, that's not cool. You shouldn't
make fun of Christopher Reeve.

30
00:02:18,096 --> 00:02:19,097
Yeah dude, not cool.

31
00:02:19,097 --> 00:02:20,641
Though it is controversial,

32
00:02:22,518 --> 00:02:24,853
...stem cell research is critical...

33
00:02:26,855 --> 00:02:28,524
...in the quest for helping...

34
00:02:30,859 --> 00:02:32,152
...the disabled.

35
00:02:32,444 --> 00:02:34,863
I put together a comedy show and I was crippled from BIRTH!

36
00:02:36,823 --> 00:02:38,992
Uh, hoo. Guys, I think we'd better stay out of this one.

37
00:02:39,034 --> 00:02:41,411
Yeah, this is starting to look like something we shouldn't be any part of.

38
00:02:41,411 --> 00:02:42,788
Let's go play with trucks or something.

39
00:02:43,247 --> 00:02:44,915
Can you believe this asswipe, Timmy?

40
00:02:45,249 --> 00:02:46,124
Timmeh!!

41
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:50,504
Why is a celebrity who became crippled more important than us that were born that way, very much.

42
00:02:50,671 --> 00:02:51,713
Rrruh Timmeh!

43
00:02:52,339 --> 00:02:53,382
In the coming days...

44
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,260
I will prove to the world...

45
00:02:57,177 --> 00:02:59,721
...that stem-cell research is a miracle.

46
00:03:00,681 --> 00:03:05,227
Beep beep beep. Move it, Kenny! Beep.

47
00:03:05,269 --> 00:03:06,019
Hey there fellas.

48
00:03:06,103 --> 00:03:07,062
Oh hey Jimmy, hey Timmy.

49
00:03:07,104 --> 00:03:07,604
Timmih!

50
00:03:07,855 --> 00:03:11,441
Say, would you guys like to join our club?
Oh, I'm sorry. You can't. You aren't crippled.

51
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,444
What?

52
00:03:14,486 --> 00:03:16,321
To be in our club, not only do you have to be c-c-crippled,

53
00:03:16,697 --> 00:03:19,283
but you have to have been born that way.
Do you know what that means?

54
00:03:19,408 --> 00:03:21,869
No butthole Superman asswipe Christopher Reeve!

55
00:03:22,536 --> 00:03:24,413
That's nice, guys. We're just gonna stay out of this one.

56
00:03:25,873 --> 00:03:28,750
Hey, wait a minute!  You guys can't just
start a club and tell me I can't be in it!

57
00:03:28,792 --> 00:03:30,460
Sorry, able-bodied, you can't join.

58
00:03:30,836 --> 00:03:31,461
Can too!

59
00:03:35,174 --> 00:03:36,008
One.

60
00:03:37,885 --> 00:03:40,220
You know what you call an able-bodied
guy on the doorstep?

61
00:03:40,721 --> 00:03:41,972
Whatever his name is.

62
00:03:43,807 --> 00:03:45,142
Oh God-damnit!!

63
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:46,518
Cartman, just stay out of it.

64
00:03:46,518 --> 00:03:47,853
But they say I can't be in their club!!

65
00:03:48,145 --> 00:03:49,980
Cartman, trust me.  We don't want any part in this one.

66
00:03:52,649 --> 00:03:55,360
Hello, Mr. McGillicuuhuhuhh...
Mr. McGillicuddy.

67
00:03:55,569 --> 00:03:57,321
Hello, boys. What can I do for you?

68
00:03:57,696 --> 00:03:59,781
Timmy and I made a ...T-shirt
design for our new club.

69
00:04:00,032 --> 00:04:01,617
We just came up with a name this morning.

70
00:04:04,286 --> 00:04:08,290
Uh... boys, I don't think you wanna wear these shirts

71
00:04:08,874 --> 00:04:09,750
Why not?

72
00:04:09,833 --> 00:04:15,047
Well, because there already is a group
that calls themselves the Crips, and
I don't think they'd like it too much.

73
00:04:16,131 --> 00:04:17,466
...There's already a Crips?!

74
00:04:18,091 --> 00:04:21,845
Well, sure, they're all over at Five Points area
in Denver. You've never heard of them?

75
00:04:21,845 --> 00:04:26,183
No, we never have. Are they crippled
from birth or are they cripple wannabes
like Christopher Reeve?

76
00:04:27,809 --> 00:04:29,686
...Oh, I am stayin' out of this one.

77
00:04:31,146 --> 00:04:35,359
Can you believe it, Timmy? All this time
there was a group for truly crippled people
like ourselves, and we didn't know it.

78
00:04:35,651 --> 00:04:36,360
Timmmeh!

79
00:04:36,777 --> 00:04:39,279
Come on. We have to take the
bus to Five Points in Denver.

80
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:43,784
My guest tonight is the brilliant star of stage
and screen, Mr. Christopher Reeve,

81
00:04:43,784 --> 00:04:47,287
who,. with the help of stem-cell research, is now able to move his arms.

82
00:04:47,663 --> 00:04:49,373
Thanks for having me on again, Larry.

83
00:04:49,373 --> 00:04:53,627
All right. Chris, the whole world is waiting.
Why don't you show us what stem-cell
research has done for you.

84
00:04:57,422 --> 00:04:59,341
Amazing. Isn't that amazing, folks?

85
00:04:59,341 --> 00:05:02,261
Now, Chris, there're some people who say stem-cell research is wrong,

86
00:05:02,261 --> 00:05:05,264
that takling cells from a fetus is... unethical.

87
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:07,850
Well, it just proves that the public needs to be educated

88
00:05:10,185 --> 00:05:14,731
...about stem-cell research.
See, the stem cells from a fetus like this one...

89
00:05:15,107 --> 00:05:17,568
can form into whatever cells
of the body are damaged.

90
00:05:17,693 --> 00:05:20,153
They are the most powerful thing on the planet.

91
00:05:20,153 --> 00:05:23,240
And how does someone like yourself
make use of the stem cells, Chris?

92
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,533
Well, it's very simple.

93
00:05:36,837 --> 00:05:39,590
And now you can see, my arms have better movement.

94
00:05:40,924 --> 00:05:42,759
Wow.  Wow.

95
00:05:50,142 --> 00:05:53,437
Excuse me, sir. We're looking for a
group of people called the Crips.

96
00:05:54,938 --> 00:05:56,148
You are?

97
00:05:56,148 --> 00:05:59,067
Do you know where they meet? We've already
tried the rec center and the library.

98
00:05:59,818 --> 00:06:04,406
The Crips hang out at that old warehouse
down there,  but ...nobody goes in there.

99
00:06:04,823 --> 00:06:07,326
Oh, it's okay. We're Crips ourselves. Come on, Tim-Tim.

100
00:06:07,326 --> 00:06:08,160
Timmmih!

101
00:06:17,211 --> 00:06:18,545
Well hello everyone.

102
00:06:20,172 --> 00:06:22,466
I'm Jim Swanson, and this is my friend Timmy.

103
00:06:22,466 --> 00:06:27,554
Timmmih!  Tih... ti-timmih.

104
00:06:28,847 --> 00:06:30,557
Well, let us tell you a little bit about ourselves.

105
00:06:31,058 --> 00:06:33,185
Timmy and I are both true Crips, born and raised.

106
00:06:33,185 --> 00:06:35,062
We're the only Crips in South Park, where we live,

107
00:06:35,062 --> 00:06:37,940
and we would love to join your fa-fa-fabtasitc Denver chapter.

108
00:06:41,527 --> 00:06:42,653
Is they for real, manh?

109
00:06:42,861 --> 00:06:45,656
We just have one question before we join your c-club.

110
00:06:45,656 --> 00:06:49,117
Do you think it's better to be born a Crip,
or to become a Crip later by accident?

111
00:06:50,077 --> 00:06:52,454
The only real Crips is born Crips, dawg.

112
00:06:52,746 --> 00:06:55,499
Yeah, you can't become a Crip by accident, fool!

113
00:06:55,791 --> 00:06:57,626
I agree. I mean, it's like "come on"!

114
00:06:58,168 --> 00:07:01,630
Why do these people who become crippled later
in life think they're such great pot-potatuhs?"

115
00:07:02,256 --> 00:07:03,048
Timmih!

116
00:07:04,883 --> 00:07:07,636
Well, we're glad you see it our way, fellas.
So can we join your g... group?

117
00:07:08,387 --> 00:07:10,472
All right, you wanna thug with the Five Point Crips?

118
00:07:11,014 --> 00:07:13,267
Bitches, all you gotta do is pop some punk-ass Bloods.

119
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:18,063
Well, sure. Tim and I would love to pop some
punk-ass Bloods. We're terrific at it.

120
00:07:18,605 --> 00:07:19,189
Timmih?

121
00:07:19,481 --> 00:07:20,983
I don't know, Timmy, just play along.

122
00:07:21,692 --> 00:07:22,609
Uh-tu-Timmih!

123
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:24,236
So you sayin' yuh down?

124
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:26,029
Down like a clown, Charlie Br...

125
00:07:26,405 --> 00:07:28,240
Down like a clown, Charlie B-broooowww...

126
00:07:28,824 --> 00:07:32,494
Down like a clown, Charlie Browh... Bro-uh-own.

127
00:07:32,494 --> 00:07:34,955
Down like a clown, Charlie Br-Brown.

128
00:07:49,094 --> 00:07:52,139
Say Timmy, did you notice that all the crippled
people in that club are negros?

129
00:07:52,431 --> 00:07:53,056
Timmih!

130
00:07:53,056 --> 00:07:57,060
That's an amm-mmazing coincidence.
I mean, there's not one crippled
colored person in South Park.

131
00:08:00,564 --> 00:08:01,315
Hey you kids.

132
00:08:02,065 --> 00:08:03,025
Well hello, officers.

133
00:08:04,026 --> 00:08:05,652
What the hell do you think you're doin'?

134
00:08:06,653 --> 00:08:08,447
We're goin' to pop some punk-ass Bloods.

135
00:08:09,198 --> 00:08:10,115
Timmih!

136
00:08:18,707 --> 00:08:20,292
Look, Timmy. There's a convenience store.

137
00:08:20,584 --> 00:08:22,961
That must be what the fellas meant by "pop some punk-ass Bloods."

138
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:25,047
They want us to get them some soda pop and treats.

139
00:08:25,339 --> 00:08:26,089
Oh, Timmih.

140
00:08:29,801 --> 00:08:32,971
Let's buy them ginger ale and marshmallows.
Then they'll let us in the club for sure."

141
00:08:35,432 --> 00:08:36,517
Oh shit!

142
00:08:42,898 --> 00:08:46,026
Suh, suh, suh, suh, Sssunday driver!

143
00:08:48,862 --> 00:08:52,991
Yo yo, listen up y'all! Let me tell you about
my little Gs, Roller and 4 Legs here.

144
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:55,536
They just smoked thirteen Bloods in one night!

145
00:08:55,827 --> 00:08:56,662
One night?

146
00:08:57,871 --> 00:08:59,665
That ain't never been done before!

147
00:09:00,207 --> 00:09:02,209
And they got us marshmallows and ginger ale.

148
00:09:03,043 --> 00:09:04,336
Uh huh. Cool. He's right.

149
00:09:04,586 --> 00:09:06,630
So does that mean we can join the c-c...club?

150
00:09:06,713 --> 00:09:09,883
You're not just in, you're the baddest mofo Crips in town!

151
00:09:10,509 --> 00:09:14,221
Cipac! Turn up the beat so we can celebrate
our new Gs Five-Points style!

152
00:09:14,471 --> 00:09:15,639
All right.

153
00:09:18,016 --> 00:09:19,476
Wow, these guys really are crippled.

154
00:09:23,146 --> 00:09:27,776
Timmy, I have a feeling that this is the start of something b-b-b-b...b-b-brilliant.

155
00:09:27,776 --> 00:09:29,027
Timmih!

156
00:09:36,118 --> 00:09:38,495
Thanks for the ride home, fellas.
We sure had a ...terrific time.

157
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:40,414
Alrighty. Keep it real though, dawg.

158
00:09:40,581 --> 00:09:42,207
You dawgs keep it real, too.

159
00:09:47,796 --> 00:09:48,714
Timmih!

160
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:51,717
Well, that sure was a terrific time.

161
00:09:52,217 --> 00:09:54,511
Let's go all around tomorrow and show everyone our new outfits, Timmy.

162
00:09:54,511 --> 00:09:55,596
Timmih!

163
00:09:57,181 --> 00:09:58,307
There you are, Jimmy!

164
00:09:58,307 --> 00:10:00,309
Whatup, Mazie? Ye-yo, Pops?

165
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:01,810
Jimmy, you rmother was gettin' worried about you.

166
00:10:02,019 --> 00:10:05,814
No need to worry about me. I'm cool like a
fool in a swimming ppp-ppp-pp-pp-pool.

167
00:10:08,817 --> 00:10:12,905
Tom, I'm standing out front of the Stem Cell Research Facility with terrific news.

168
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:17,409
Christopher Reeve, who was once paralyzed, claims that he can now stand.

169
00:10:17,784 --> 00:10:18,619
Thank you everyone.

170
00:10:18,619 --> 00:10:21,496
To most people, this is just an ordinary fetus.

171
00:10:21,496 --> 00:10:24,208
But to people like me, it's hope.

172
00:10:38,096 --> 00:10:39,306
What an inspiration.

173
00:10:40,098 --> 00:10:43,393
Tom, many celebrities have spoken out in protest of stem-cell research,

174
00:10:43,393 --> 00:10:47,105
but, after seeing this, how can they protest now?

175
00:10:50,817 --> 00:10:52,194
Stay clear, guys, stay clear.

176
00:10:52,236 --> 00:10:53,487
Yup. I'm not seeing anything.

177
00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:02,788
Hey  Hey, I don't want no trouber!

178
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:05,916
Hello. We'd like two orders of Kung ...Pao Chicken, please.

179
00:11:05,999 --> 00:11:08,794
I don't want no trouble! You jus... take what you want and reave!

180
00:11:09,086 --> 00:11:09,795
Timmih!

181
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:12,381
OH! Okay, okay!  I opening register

182
00:11:12,589 --> 00:11:13,215
Timmh.

183
00:11:13,215 --> 00:11:15,717
What's that?
Oh, and one medium lemonade, please.

184
00:11:16,218 --> 00:11:19,680
Here. Here one hundred twelve dorrar!
It's all I have. Yeh take!

185
00:11:21,807 --> 00:11:23,684
You take! Uh one hundred twelve dorrar!

186
00:11:25,602 --> 00:11:26,687
Ah- are you sure?

187
00:11:26,728 --> 00:11:28,897
I no want no trouble. Just take it and reave!

188
00:11:29,314 --> 00:11:31,400
Well gee, that's really nice of you, Mr. ...Chinese person.

189
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:32,985
Look Tim-Tim, we got a cash prize.

190
00:11:32,985 --> 00:11:35,612
We must be the ...one hundredth customer or something.

191
00:11:35,696 --> 00:11:38,907
Here! Here two order of Kung Pao Chicken, and small ice tea!

192
00:11:38,991 --> 00:11:40,617
Actually, it was a regular lemonade.

193
00:11:41,118 --> 00:11:47,207
AAAAAGH-agh!! I sorry! I sorry! I no want no
trouble. Here. Remonade. Now go, just go!

194
00:11:47,291 --> 00:11:49,585
Gee, thanks a lot. See you next time.

195
00:11:49,793 --> 00:11:50,502
Timmih!

196
00:11:54,089 --> 00:11:57,885
Hello! Police? I've just been robbed by two gang members!

197
00:11:59,511 --> 00:12:02,514
Jimmy? Jimmy, could you come into the kitchen please?

198
00:12:03,807 --> 00:12:05,309
Yo, Mamsie. What's up, Pops?

199
00:12:05,309 --> 00:12:07,811
Uh have a seat, Jim. Your mother and I need to talk to you.

200
00:12:18,614 --> 00:12:21,909
Son, your mother and I have noticed a change in your behavior.

201
00:12:22,409 --> 00:12:25,913
And... we're worried that you might be involved in a gang.

202
00:12:25,996 --> 00:12:27,497
A what? Oh, you mean the fellas.

203
00:12:27,998 --> 00:12:31,418
Well sure. But I can't talk about the club on account of it's sssuper secret, dawg.

204
00:12:31,418 --> 00:12:33,795
Then it's true! Oh, Ryan, it's true!

205
00:12:35,005 --> 00:12:38,717
Why you be trippin', Mom? I mean come on.
I'm finally a part of something, very much.

206
00:12:39,009 --> 00:12:41,303
Jimmy, those people you're hanging out with are no good.

207
00:12:41,595 --> 00:12:45,098
Yo, don't be dissing my niggaz, dawg. They're my f... friends.

208
00:12:45,390 --> 00:12:49,186
And what about your standup comedy, Jim, huh?
Are you just giving up on that, too?

209
00:12:49,603 --> 00:12:55,192
Nobody cared about my standup comedy!
All that hard work just to be outshined by
C-Christopher Reeve the super b-butthole!

210
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:58,820
Uh Jimmy, we've told you before. God made you the way he did for a reason!

211
00:12:58,987 --> 00:13:01,698
Right. Because you and Mom used to make fun of crippled kids in high school.

212
00:13:02,199 --> 00:13:06,286
That's right. You were sent here through
the vengeful and angry hand of God
to teach your mother and I a lesson.

213
00:13:06,787 --> 00:13:08,497
And that's a big responsibility, son.

214
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:11,500
Look! My gang, which I can't talk about because it's super secret,

215
00:13:11,792 --> 00:13:16,213
is the most important thing to me now! And
if you two don't like it, you can just pass
the blunt to the nigga on your left.

216
00:13:22,302 --> 00:13:25,681
Where's that delivery of new fetuses?!
Feeling weak again.

217
00:13:26,098 --> 00:13:27,307
Here's the new shipment, sir.

218
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:34,690
Hello there, Christopher.

219
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:39,319
Well, well, Gene Hackman, my nemesis
from the movies. How are you?

220
00:13:40,112 --> 00:13:41,405
I'm good. You?

221
00:13:42,114 --> 00:13:45,117
I am better with each passing day.
Stronger and more agile.

222
00:13:47,119 --> 00:13:50,289
Christopher, I've come to ask you to stop what you're doing?

223
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:52,708
What?

224
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:57,087
Using stem cells is like playing God.
You should leave nature alone.

225
00:13:58,088 --> 00:14:01,717
And go back to the way I was? Is that
what you're saying, Hackman?

226
00:14:02,009 --> 00:14:05,804
I'm saying that sometimes you need to just live
with the cards you're dealt, Christopher.

227
00:14:05,804 --> 00:14:09,183
Stop calling me Christopher! That name no longer has meaning to me!

228
00:14:09,183 --> 00:14:13,604
Christopher was someone who lived in a wheelchair!
Always being pushed around by others!

229
00:14:13,604 --> 00:14:15,814
The old Christopher Reeve is dead!

230
00:14:15,814 --> 00:14:18,108
From now on, I am...

231
00:14:19,610 --> 00:14:21,320
Chris!

232
00:14:22,404 --> 00:14:26,116
Sixty-five... bottles of... beer on the wall. Six-

233
00:14:29,786 --> 00:14:31,413
Payback time, mothafucka!

234
00:14:32,789 --> 00:14:33,790
Jesus Christ!

235
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:39,213
Holy G...guacamole!

236
00:14:42,716 --> 00:14:43,800
Freakin' Frijoles!

237
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:50,015
Leapin' L-langosta.

238
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:52,601
East Side Bloods!

239
00:14:56,813 --> 00:14:59,608
We're Detectives Hyde and Richardson
from the Special Gang unit in Denver.

240
00:14:59,608 --> 00:15:01,693
Any word on who shot up me and Timmy's houses, officer?

241
00:15:01,985 --> 00:15:04,488
Word on the street is it was a retaliation hit by the Bloods.

242
00:15:04,988 --> 00:15:06,698
The... B-Bloods?

243
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:08,784
You know, smart-mouth! Your rival gang!

244
00:15:08,784 --> 00:15:12,120
The Bloods are at war with the Crips,
they kill each other all the time!

245
00:15:12,162 --> 00:15:12,788
The-they do??

246
00:15:12,788 --> 00:15:14,581
Don't act like you don't know, you lil punk!

247
00:15:14,998 --> 00:15:17,292
The Crips and Bloods hate each other, and if you stay in that gang,

248
00:15:17,709 --> 00:15:19,002
you're gonna end up dead too.

249
00:15:19,002 --> 00:15:20,295
But... but why do they hate each other?

250
00:15:20,504 --> 00:15:23,507
Look kid, I used to be a Crip myself, but I'm not anymore!

251
00:15:24,591 --> 00:15:26,593
Oh, so you used ssstemm cells like Christopher Reeve?

252
00:15:27,094 --> 00:15:30,597
Come on. The only way these kids are gonna get out of their gang is get killed.

253
00:15:32,015 --> 00:15:33,183
Sarah!

254
00:15:34,017 --> 00:15:37,020
Oh boy, Timmy, we should have never started a gang for people crippled from birth.

255
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:39,189
Now they're at war with the people who are crippled from an accident.

256
00:15:39,398 --> 00:15:40,482
Boy were we wrong.

257
00:15:41,108 --> 00:15:42,401
Tim-mih.

258
00:15:42,693 --> 00:15:43,986
Wow, w-we've got to do something, Timmy.

259
00:15:43,986 --> 00:15:46,613
We've gotta get the Crips and Bloods to sstop fighting.

260
00:15:46,613 --> 00:15:49,116
I bet if we could just get them together... but how?

261
00:15:49,992 --> 00:15:52,494
Wu-wait a minute! I've got it! A lock-in at the rec center!

262
00:15:52,619 --> 00:15:55,914
We did it for our church once. All we do is rent out the rec center overnight.

263
00:15:55,914 --> 00:15:57,207
They lock the doors so nobody can leave,

264
00:15:57,207 --> 00:15:59,710
and then everyone has the whole night to play in the swimming pool and laugh and talk.

265
00:15:59,710 --> 00:16:00,586
Timmih!!

266
00:16:00,711 --> 00:16:02,713
You get all the Crips you can to the rec center tomorrow night, Timmy.

267
00:16:03,088 --> 00:16:04,298
And I'll try to get all the ...Bloods there.

268
00:16:04,298 --> 00:16:05,090
Timmih!!

269
00:16:05,215 --> 00:16:07,301
This is gonna be t-terrific!

270
00:16:09,011 --> 00:16:12,806
Tom, several years ago, actor Christopher Reeve had a horrible accident and was paralyzed.

271
00:16:13,515 --> 00:16:17,019
The irony, of course, is that the man who played Superman could no longer walk.

272
00:16:17,394 --> 00:16:20,981
America watched in wonder as he managed to move one of his fingers, then his arms.

273
00:16:21,315 --> 00:16:26,820
And now, seen for the first time on HBC, Christopher Reeve is going to lift a truck up over his head.

274
00:16:32,784 --> 00:16:33,911
Oh, what a fighter.

275
00:16:33,994 --> 00:16:35,412
That brave, brave man.

276
00:16:35,412 --> 00:16:36,997
He's an imspration to us all.

277
00:16:37,706 --> 00:16:44,004
Tom, the irony is even more irony-y as it appears
that the stem cells have given Christopher Reeve almost superhuman strength.

278
00:16:44,796 --> 00:16:46,089
Chris, that's enough!

279
00:16:47,090 --> 00:16:48,800
Hello, Gene! So good to see you!

280
00:16:49,009 --> 00:16:51,720
You're cured, Chris. It's time to stop using stem cells.

281
00:16:52,012 --> 00:16:55,807
Stem-cell research has made me stronger than I ever thought possible! Why stop now?!

282
00:16:56,016 --> 00:17:00,103
Uh Tom, apparently, Gene Hackman, the man who played Superman's enemy Lex Luthor in the movies,

283
00:17:00,521 --> 00:17:03,398
has now shown up as a celebrity protester of stem-cell research.

284
00:17:03,690 --> 00:17:06,109
If that isn't ironic, Tom, I don't know what is.

285
00:17:06,318 --> 00:17:11,615
They're affecting your mind, Chris. If you won't stop using stem cells, then we'll stop you!

286
00:17:12,199 --> 00:17:14,993
Stop me?! Stop me?! HA!!

287
00:17:21,083 --> 00:17:23,001
You won't stop me, Hack Man!

288
00:17:27,589 --> 00:17:32,219
Tom, if irony were made of strawberries, we'd all be drinking a lot of smoothies right now.

289
00:17:36,014 --> 00:17:38,600
Come on in, everybody. Lots of su-surprises and t-treats inside.

290
00:17:40,018 --> 00:17:41,895
Great to see you all. What a terrific audience.

291
00:17:43,188 --> 00:17:45,482
Are you sure you got everything you need, young man?

292
00:17:45,691 --> 00:17:47,484
We sure do. Thanks, Mr. Apple...b-by.

293
00:17:47,609 --> 00:17:50,988
Just remember to make sure the kids play safe in the pool area.

294
00:17:51,113 --> 00:17:51,905
You bet.

295
00:17:51,989 --> 00:17:55,117
I'll be back at seven to let you out. You kids have a good time.

296
00:17:55,492 --> 00:17:56,410
Oh, we will.

297
00:18:03,208 --> 00:18:03,917
The Bloods!

298
00:18:04,209 --> 00:18:05,586
Oh shit! It's a trap!

299
00:18:05,586 --> 00:18:07,504
Muthafucka Crips tryin' to smoke us all out!

300
00:18:07,713 --> 00:18:09,590
What the hell is goin' on here?

301
00:18:09,882 --> 00:18:11,008
It's called a lock-in at the rec center.

302
00:18:11,717 --> 00:18:13,218
We can use all the rec center facilities.

303
00:18:13,218 --> 00:18:17,389
We can play basketball, go swimming,
or even just kick it in the lounge area
with some games and ...p-puzzles.

304
00:18:17,598 --> 00:18:18,515
Timmih!

305
00:18:18,599 --> 00:18:20,601
But nobody can leave until it's seven a.m.,

306
00:18:20,809 --> 00:18:23,103
so if you wanna have a good time, you're
all just gonna have to learn to get along.

307
00:18:31,987 --> 00:18:33,906
Theeerrre's pizzaaa.

308
00:18:35,282 --> 00:18:39,494
Tom, over five years ago, doctors told Christopher Reeve that he would never walk again,

309
00:18:39,494 --> 00:18:42,289
but the resilient actor fought back, struggled against all odds,

310
00:18:42,289 --> 00:18:45,501
and has now built his very own Legion of Doom!

311
00:18:46,210 --> 00:18:51,215
The once immobile Mr. Reeve's new organization will be commited to world domination and evil.

312
00:18:51,298 --> 00:18:53,300
What an inspirational story, Tom.

313
00:18:54,092 --> 00:18:59,306
I have chosen each member of this elite group of supervillains for their outstanding treachery,

314
00:18:59,306 --> 00:19:03,602
Their desire for world conquest,  and their hatred of all things good!

315
00:19:03,602 --> 00:19:06,480
And I've assembled this group for one purpose!

316
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:09,983
To once and for all find a way to...

317
00:19:10,609 --> 00:19:15,906
...get rid of Hack Man!!

318
00:19:15,989 --> 00:19:18,617
Uhhh, how about domination of the world?

319
00:19:18,992 --> 00:19:21,203
Yeah. Or uh, death to the infidels?

320
00:19:21,411 --> 00:19:26,083
Silence! OUR job is to see to it that Hack Man is put out of commission.

321
00:19:26,416 --> 00:19:29,711
Oh boy, General Disarray, muh maybe we just oughtta stay outta this one.

322
00:19:30,796 --> 00:19:32,005
Not so fast, Chris!

323
00:19:32,381 --> 00:19:33,590
Hack Man!

324
00:19:33,799 --> 00:19:38,595
We just helped pass a ban on stem-cell research. Your fetus-sucking days are over!

325
00:19:38,804 --> 00:19:40,681
No...  NOOOO!

326
00:19:40,806 --> 00:19:44,601
And now we're goingn to put you somewhere
where you can never touch another fetus again!

327
00:19:46,103 --> 00:19:47,688
You stupid mofos are dead!

328
00:19:47,980 --> 00:19:49,189
Make the first shot, punk!

329
00:19:49,398 --> 00:19:56,113
Hold it! Don't you see? It doesn't matter
if we were crippled from birth, or crippled in an accident.
We're all brothers.

330
00:19:56,613 --> 00:19:58,907
Save it, fool! Crips ain't our brothers!

331
00:19:58,991 --> 00:20:02,911
Look: we hve the whole rec room to ourselves.
Can't we all just try having some fun together?

332
00:20:02,911 --> 00:20:04,288
You talkin' crazy, dawg.

333
00:20:04,413 --> 00:20:05,998
Yeah, we ain't playin', sucka!

334
00:20:06,081 --> 00:20:08,917
Why don't we at least give it a chance? I mean,  Come on!

335
00:20:11,211 --> 00:20:13,714
Wait a minute. What did you say?

336
00:20:14,089 --> 00:20:16,091
I said, "I mean,  Come on!"

337
00:20:18,093 --> 00:20:21,680
You know, maybe he's right. I mean,  Come on!

338
00:20:22,181 --> 00:20:23,307
Come on.

339
00:20:23,807 --> 00:20:28,187
I guess we could at least give havin'
fun together a try. It's like  Come on.

340
00:20:28,187 --> 00:20:29,479
Yeah. Come on.

341
00:20:29,813 --> 00:20:30,981
Yeah, that's right. Come on.

342
00:20:30,981 --> 00:20:31,815
Come on.

343
00:20:31,815 --> 00:20:32,399
Come on.

344
00:20:32,399 --> 00:20:34,484
Yeah, that's right. Come on.

345
00:20:43,285 --> 00:20:46,288
I've gotta give you two dawgs props for puttin' an end to all this hate.

346
00:20:46,413 --> 00:20:48,415
I told you, lock-ins at the rec center always work.

347
00:20:48,790 --> 00:20:50,292
And you know, I've learned something, too.

348
00:20:50,417 --> 00:20:53,504
I was player-hatin' Christopher Butthole Reeve because he got more attention than me.

349
00:20:53,795 --> 00:20:57,508
But just like... y-you guys, I need to learn to control my a... anger.

350
00:20:58,091 --> 00:20:58,509
Right on!

351
00:20:59,009 --> 00:21:01,512
Hey little Roller, try some of this chronic shit.

352
00:21:01,595 --> 00:21:02,513
Timmih!

353
00:21:05,307 --> 00:21:08,685
I guess we all learned that trying to get along is way better than p... player hatin'.

354
00:21:09,019 --> 00:21:11,104
The gang wrote a song about it. Why don't we listen in?

355
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:13,398
<b>It used to be that Crips and Bloods didn't get along,</b>

356
00:21:13,607 --> 00:21:15,692
<i>But now we're all a family, so we wrote this song.</i>

357
00:21:16,193 --> 00:21:20,405
<i>Naaa na naaa, Crips and Bloods. Naaa na naaa, hope and love.</i>

358
00:21:20,989 --> 00:21:23,116
<i>Naaa na naaa, friendly thugs.</i>

359
00:21:24,409 --> 00:21:31,291
You haven't seen the last of me, Hack Man! I will be back!!

360
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,002
Dude, I am so glad we stayed out of that one.



9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
