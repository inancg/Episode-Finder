Episode 706 - Lil' Crime Stoppers

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,300
I'm going down to South Park,
gonna have myself a time.

3
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:13,700
Friendly faces everywhere,
humble folks without temptation.

4
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:16,900
Going down to South Park,
gonna leave my woes behind.

5
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:20,400
Ample parking day or night,
people spouting, "Howdy neighbor!"

6
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:23,600
Headin’ on up to South Park,
gonna see if I can't unwind.

7
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:30,100
So, come on down to South Park
and meet some friends of mine.

8
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:36,400
Yes? Oh, hello, boys.

9
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:40,500
Hello, sir. South Park Junior Detectives.
We're wondering if you have any crimes
to be solved, for a dollar.

10
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:45,000
Oooo, little crime stoppers, huh?
Well, I'm afraid I don't have any
crimes I need solved right now.

11
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:46,000
Awww, shit!

12
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:48,200
All right, sir, well, please call us
if you need anything.

13
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:50,000
I'll do that. Have fun, boys.

14
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:53,200
Stupid assholes!
How come nobody has a crime to solve?

15
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:55,400
Yeah, maybe starting a detective club
isn't such a bright idea

16
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:57,400
It's a great idea,
we just have to keep working at it.

17
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,500
Oh, hello there boys.

18
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:04,600
Hello, ma'am, we're detectives
with the South Park Crime Unit.

19
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:06,500
Do you have any crimes you need to be solved,
for a dollar?

20
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:09,200
Ohh, neighborhood detectives, huh?
Well let me thin..

21
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:11,800
Oh yes, there is something!
- Really?

22
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:16,500
Yes. Two days ago I put a fresh baked cherry pie
out on my window sill to cool.

23
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:18,900
And later, when I went to get it, it was gone.

24
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,700
My God...

25
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:22,400
Have you reported this to any other authorities?

26
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:25,300
Noo, but I think it's a perfect case for you kids.

27
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:27,000
Cool! We'll see what we can find, ma'am.

28
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:28,900
We're on the case.

29
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
What have you got, Marsh?

30
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:32,700
Detective McCormick
found something interesting.

31
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:39,600
Jesus, we're too late.

32
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:41,600
I think we can piece this case together now.

33
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:47,900
My pie tin! Oooh,
but what happened to the pie?

34
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:50,600
Well, we've all talked it through
and we've come up with a theory.

35
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:52,900
Well, what do you thnk happened,
little detectives?

36
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,900
You said you set the pie in the window sill,
where it must have sat for some time.

37
00:01:57,250 --> 00:02:00,100
But its sweet smell attracted
the attention of somebody.

38
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:01,900
Your husband.

39
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:06,000
He wanted that pie badly, but he knew
that he was not allowed to eat it yet.

40
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:08,400
Slowly the rage built inside his mind.

41
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:10,000
Why won't she let me eat that pie?

42
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:12,200
Why does she always stop me
from doing what I wanna do?!

43
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:13,700
His only solution became obvious:

44
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,000
Kill her!

45
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:16,600
His plan was to use a hammer.

46
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:19,500
Bash, bash, BASH your skull in,
causing instant death.

47
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:21,500
Then to make it impossible for police
to identify the body,

48
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:23,200
he'd use a shovel to remove your head.

49
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:25,100
Then saw off the arms and legs.

50
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:27,600
The torso he would dump into the lake.

51
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:31,000
The arms and legs he would dissolve
with acid and lye in the bathtub.

52
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:33,500
And then, finally,
he'd be able to eat that pie.

53
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:35,700
But before he could go through
with this entire plan,

54
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:37,500
he discovered that the pie
had already been eaten...

55
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:39,200
...by your dog.

56
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:41,500
Looks like the game is over, old man!

57
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:46,700
Oh my God, what kind of television
have you kids been watching??

58
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:48,200
Just the news.

59
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,900
All right, all right, you you boys run along now.

60
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:52,900
Hey, you owe us a dollar, lady.

61
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:54,700
Fine, here, just go!

62
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:58,100
Wow, look, you guys! Our first dollar!

63
00:02:58,300 --> 00:02:59,900
We're in business!

64
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:06,300
Kenny, you got the f-a-g
on that perp in Washington

65
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:08,700
Boys, you have a little visitor.

66
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:12,000
Is this the South Park Crime Unit?

67
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:14,500
Yes it is!

68
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:16,200
I lost my dollie.

69
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:18,300
Thank you, Ms. Secretary, that will be all.

70
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:22,000
And get some more cookies and coffee!
We're not paying you to sit on your ass!

71
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:23,500
Do you kow where your doll is?

72
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:26,500
If I knew where it was,
it wouldn't be lost.

73
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:28,000
All right, Sarah, come over here.

74
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:30,500
Now, I want you to describe
what the doll looks like to our

75
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:31,600
sketch artist, Kenny.

76
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:34,800
She has curly blonde hair.

77
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:37,300
And a red dress.

78
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:39,400
And a turned-up nose.

79
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:41,900
And a blue bow in her hair.

80
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:44,500
You got it, Ken?

81
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:46,500
All right, let's see.

82
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:49,300
Damnit Kenny, that's not what she said!

83
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:50,800
Put that away, dude!

84
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,800
Don't worry, ma'am. We'll find your doll.

85
00:03:59,150 --> 00:04:00,600
No sign of forced entry.

86
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:02,200
But the window isn't locked.

87
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:04,600
Right, so it's possible that the
theif sat out in that tree.

88
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,300
He would have watched Sarah
with the doll,

89
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,800
possibly while cutting the palms
of his hands with a large knife.

90
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:10,300
The pain gave him sick pleasure.

91
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,400
Disposing of the doll wouldn't be easy.

92
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:14,500
He would have had to have brough
a shovel to decapitate it.

93
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:16,700
We're going to need semen samples
from everything in this room.

94
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:19,500
All right, let's do this by the books!
McDonnell,

95
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,500
give me smears of all the places
the doll used to be!

96
00:04:21,550 --> 00:04:23,200
Mitchell, run a tap on the phone!

97
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:25,100
Hey, kid, what are you doing?

98
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:27,300
Agent Tucker, FBI! And you?

99
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:29,800
Detective Marsh.
I'm in charge of this investigation!

100
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,800
Not anymore, you're not!

101
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:34,200
Hey, this is our case!
You can't come in and take over!

102
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:36,000
Can't we? You guys are playing Detective.

103
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:39,300
We're playing FBI.
That gives us jurisdiction over you!

104
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:40,500
Aw crap!

105
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:42,200
I want choppers on the roof ready to go!

106
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:44,200
Dude, we've been working this case
since two-thirty!

107
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:47,300
Good. Then you can help us
by telling me everything you know.

108
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:49,900
Son of a bitch stupid FBI!

109
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:52,300
Well, I guess we can go back
to playing laundromat.

110
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,200
No! We're not gonna stop playing
detectives!

111
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:56,700
We've just gotta find that doll
before thos FBI guys do.

112
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:57,300
Yeah!

113
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:58,200
Yeah, but how?

114
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:00,500
We're gonna have to just start
bringing in people for questioning.

115
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:02,900
Right. I think I know exactly where to start.

116
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,500
Where were you this morning
at nine o'clock, Butters?!

117
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:08,600
Ah, I was at home.

118
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:10,100
Your story is full of holes
and I'm gonna beat your ass

119
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:11,400
if you don't start tellin' the truth!

120
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:15,000
Awww, don't be so hard.
Maybe he's tellin' the truth, huh?

121
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:17,800
They've gotten really good
at this good cop-bad cop thing.

122
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:19,600
You're going down, Butters!
You hear me?!

123
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:22,400
Aw. Now just be nice.
Poor lil thing.

124
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:24,400
You're worth a two-dollar
criminal and you're lying!

125
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:26,600
Aw, please don't make him confess.

126
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:29,100
Well I don't have nothin'
to confess. Honestly.

127
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:32,100
Fine! Then you won't mind
giving us a semen sample.

128
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:33,800
How do I do that?

129
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:35,200
You just make the semen
come out of your body

130
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:36,300
and fill it in this cup!

131
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:38,200
Well how do I make semen...
come out of my body?

132
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:39,000
Stop playing games!

133
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:40,700
I'm not playing. I really don't know!

134
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,100
That does it! Wait right here!

135
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:46,000
Guys, did you hear that?

136
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:48,300
Butters doesn't know how you
make seme come out of your body.

137
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,600
How... do you make semen come out?

138
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:52,300
I don't know. I was hoping you guys did.

139
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:53,700
It's that thing we learned
about in school

140
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:55,700
where you pull on your weiner
until white stuff comes out.

141
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:56,400
Really?

142
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:59,900
Ohh, right, you're supposed to pull
and mager...venate your weiner really fast.

143
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:00,500
Oh okay.

144
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:04,100
Okay, retard, you really don't know
how to make semen come out?!

145
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:04,700
No-o!

146
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,100
Follow me to the bathroom.

147
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:08,300
Aw, it's okay kid. It's just done in a jiffy

148
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:13,100
Now, go sit on the toilet and pull
and tug on your weiner

149
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:15,100
until white stuff comes out,
and then put it in this cup.

150
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:16,000
My weiner??

151
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:18,700
Yes, retard. Semen comes
from your weiner. Now do it!

152
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Well Butters?!

153
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:28,000
Ah I'm pullin' on my weiner,
but nothin's happening.

154
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:29,200
Well pull harder!

155
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:35,500
It's not workin'

156
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:36,800
Try doin' it faster

157
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:42,100
Naw, nothin'

158
00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:43,700
Butters, do you wanna go to jail
for the rest of your life?!

159
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:44,400
NOOooo!

160
00:06:44,450 --> 00:06:46,500
Then you'd better get that semen
sample no matter how long it takes!

161
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:47,500
Okay!!

162
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,500
Cartman! Cartman! We just got a tip
that a doll was found near Fosse's house!

163
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:52,700
Let's go!

164
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:04,100
Huhuh, Okay Ms., Ms. Jones, heh,
me and Doctor... Flick

165
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:06,000
here just need to... check your vagina.

166
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:07,900
That's gay.

167
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:08,700
Yeah, that's gay.

168
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:12,400
Kyle!

169
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:26,700
Co?

170
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:39,800
Co??

171
00:07:40,350 --> 00:07:42,100
Vidím dva kluky uvnitø.

172
00:07:42,150 --> 00:07:45,000
Mají Sáøinu panenku,
ty pitomej Žide!

173
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:47,300
They've got the doll!

174
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:53,500
Okay, okay. Ready?
Break the door down!

175
00:07:58,300 --> 00:07:59,500
Huh huh who is it?!

176
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:02,500
South Park Junior Detectives!
We know you have Sarah Peterson's doll!

177
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:04,800
They're playing Detective.

178
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:06,000
That's gay.

179
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:07,100
You're gay!

180
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
What do we do now?

181
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:09,700
I don't know.

182
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:13,000
Well if they're not gonna give us
back the doll, then we have no choice.

183
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:14,800
Let's go tell on them.

184
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:17,400
Dude, we just can't tell on them.

185
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:18,200
Why not?

186
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:21,500
Because, dude, we're playing detectives!
Detectives don't just go tell on people.

187
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:22,800
Detectives!

188
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:27,500
If you don't get out of here,
we're gonna rip the doll's head off!

189
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:28,800
Yeah.

190
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:32,400
We were playing gynecologists
and now we're playing criminals

191
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:33,700
That's gay.

192
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:34,900
We're gay.

193
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Jesus! They're gonna kill her!

194
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:37,100
We've got to do something.

195
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,700
Time! Time is what we need,
but time is something we ain't got!

196
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:41,000
Attention! You in the house!

197
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:44,500
This is Agent Tucker with the FBI!
We have you surrounded. Sort of.

198
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,500
Hey, you buttholes can't play FBI here!

199
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,100
Yeah! This was our hot lead!

200
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:52,900
And you did a great job leading us here.
Now you just stay out of our way!

201
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,400
The gig is up, Fosse! Bring out the doll!
Or we'll tell on you!

202
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:58,300
We're gonna charge the front door
and go get it.

203
00:08:58,400 --> 00:08:59,400
No you're not.

204
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:01,400
Damnit man, this is not the time for negotiations!

205
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:03,400
There's a little doll in there about
to have her head twisted off!

206
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:05,500
Time out, kid! We say you can't charge
the front door,

207
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:08,000
and you have to obey what the FBI says!
That's the rules!

208
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:10,100
Just because your parents can afford
better toys than ours

209
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,300
doesn't make you better than us!

210
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:13,300
Yes it does so!

211
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:19,700
What do we do now?

212
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:21,100
We go get the doll ourselves.

213
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,900
But they said we can't charge
the front door.

214
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:27,000
That's right. But they didn't say
anything about going in the back.

215
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:30,000
Come on guys.
You don't wanna hurt that doll.

216
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:32,700
Oh crap, they're coming in the back!

217
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:41,000
That's gay.

218
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,200
I got you, Fosse!

219
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:44,300
No you didn't!

220
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:45,200
Did so!

221
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:47,500
No, 'cause I got... special wizard armor on.

222
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,700
We're not playing Dungeons and Dragons,
assface!

223
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:52,400
All right, that does it!
Cover me! I'm going slo-mo!

224
00:09:58,400 --> 00:09:59,500
Oooh, they got me!

225
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:08,500
We're dead.

226
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:09,900
That's gay

227
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:12,600
We got it.

228
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:20,800
Ms. Peterson, is your daughter home?

229
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:23,000
My dollie!

230
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:26,700
We got her back safe.
We lost a lot of good men in the process.

231
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:28,600
Well you boys are little heroes.

232
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:31,000
I'm going to call the police department
and let them know

233
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:33,200
what brave little detectives you are!

234
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:41,900
Hello there little crime stoppers,
I'm Lieutenant Dawson with the Park County Police.

235
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,500
I heard you did a great job finding
Sarah Peterson's doll.

236
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:46,900
We do what we can, sir.

237
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:51,600
W-hell, that's fantastic, kids.
And for all your terrific sleuth-solving,

238
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:55,000
I'm here by making you all
Jenior Detectives.

239
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:02,500
That means you boys are now
an official part of the department.

240
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:03,300
Kewl!

241
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:05,500
All right, so ready for your first assignment?

242
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:06,300
Sure.

243
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:09,600
Okay. There's a meth lab down at 567 Mala Vista.

244
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:12,500
The operators are probably armed
to the hilt with illegal weapons.

245
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:14,800
I want you to get down there
and see what you can find!

246
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:18,500
Ah... a a a meth lab?

247
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:21,000
I don't want any problems.
Just take them down by the books.

248
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:23,800
Now get over there;
the mayor's all over my ass on this one!

249
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,200
On, and deputies: you screw this up

250
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:31,500
and I'll have you working graveyard
shift behind a desk! Move it!

251
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,700
What is a meth lab, anyway?

252
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:40,300
I don't know. Let's just hurry up.
I wanna get home in time to watch Crime Drama.

253
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,400
Uh police. Open up....

254
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:57,500
Oh crap, did you guys do
your math homework?

255
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,000
Nah. Dude, I totally spaced it.

256
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:01,700
You die, pigs!

257
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:05,000
You want to die, huh?

258
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:15,800
You won't take us alive!

259
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:27,500
So long, coppers!

260
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:36,800
Damn.

261
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,000
One UPS vehicle valued at
twenty-five thousand dollars,

262
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:44,100
one civilian vehicle valued
at sixteen thousand,

263
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:48,200
the second floor of the post office
AND a coffee shop valued at sixteen thousand!

264
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:50,500
The mayor's gonna have my ass!

265
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:52,800
Uh, sir, we just kinda got blind-sided
by the...

266
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:53,900
You got careless!

267
00:12:53,950 --> 00:12:58,500
Now, I don't know how they do things down
at that dog-and-pony show they call
the Fourth Grade,

268
00:12:58,600 --> 00:12:59,600
but here we have rules!

269
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:03,300
Jesus, we don't have guys to
question now, because you killed them all!

270
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:04,600
We're sorry.

271
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:06,700
One more slip-up like that
and I'll have your badges!

272
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:09,200
You hear me?!
Now hit the showers!

273
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:13,700
Well well well, if it isn't the supercops.

274
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:18,500
Hey Murphy, think they'll let me
borrow their G.I. Joes?

275
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,000
Come on, you guys. Leave them alone.

276
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:24,000
Relax, Hopkins! All fun and games, right?

277
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:28,600
Soho, tell us, rookies, you ah...
find yourself a little bonus in that house??

278
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:29,700
Uh bonus?

279
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Come on! We all skim a little off the top.

280
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:34,700
Oh. Or are you too good for that?

281
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:38,700
So you think you're gonna waltz
in here and clean up the system. Is that it?

282
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:40,600
We just wanna be junior detectives.

283
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:44,500
Look, we all work hard! And we deserve
more than the thirty-thousand a year we get paid!

284
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:48,500
So what if we take in a little on the side?
-Yeah! Who the hell are you to change that?!

285
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:50,100
I said, back off Murphy!

286
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:52,400
Why don't you and your rookie friends make us

287
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:54,900
That's right. Come on, bring it!
Yeah, let's go! Come on, bring it!

288
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,500
What the hell is the problem here??

289
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:59,700
No problem, sir. No problem at all.

290
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:02,000
Then hit the showers, all of you!

291
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,500
Dude, I don't wanna play Detective anymore.

292
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:10,700
Me neither.

293
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:11,700
It'll get better, guys.

294
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:12,700
Better how, dude?

295
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:15,800
Look, we said we wanted to form
a club to protect and serve South Park.

296
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:18,100
We put all this time to it, I mean...
What do you guys wanna do, huh?

297
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:20,800
Go back to playing Car Mechanics?
Or Laundromat Owners?

298
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:22,300
We were happy playing Laundromat Owners.

299
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:26,000
I wasn't. We started playing Detective
because we wanted our play time
to mean something.

300
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:27,800
Or have you forgotten why you
joined the force, Kyle?

301
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:29,200
Hey! Broflovski's a good cop!

302
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:32,200
You guys can go back to playing
Laundromat Owners if you want, but...

303
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:35,200
I'm not gonna give those kids playing
the FBI a chance to laugh at us

304
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:36,800
See you guys at school tomorrow.

305
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:47,900
Eric, where have you been? It's ten thirty.

306
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,900
We had to take down a meth lab
on Mala Vista.

307
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,400
Well you should've called Mommy.

308
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:53,900
Will you get off my back?! It's hard enough
I gotta work the beat,

309
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,500
and now I gotta come home to your nagging?!

310
00:14:56,900 --> 00:15:00,300
Look look, I'm I'm sorry. It's just this case,
and... the guys down at the station,

311
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:02,300
I... I'm tired, alright? I'm I'm tired.

312
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:05,200
Well, why don't you get ready for
snoogums' night-night,

313
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:07,000
and I'll bring you some toasty
chocolate nummers?

314
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:09,000
Okay.

315
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:15,700
Butters?

316
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:16,700
Yes?

317
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,400
Are you still trying to give a semen sample?

318
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:20,300
Well I'm tryin', but nothin's comin' out.

319
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:22,700
Well, keep tryin', Butters.

320
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:32,400
And so you can see, children, that the
women's movement of the late fifties

321
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:35,600
and the early sixties had a profound
effect on feminism in America.

322
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:40,300
Uh, boys! Would it trouble you
terribly not to sleep in my class?

323
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,300
Uh wu we weren't sleeping, Mr. Garrison.

324
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:45,000
Oh well, then maybe you can tell me
who was in charge of the feminist

325
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:46,500
movement of the early sixties!

326
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:49,200
A bunch of fat old skanks on their periods?

327
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:52,900
Right, but who was the fattest
oldest skank on her period?!

328
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:57,800
That's what I thought!
Now pay attention!

329
00:15:57,900 --> 00:16:01,200
Okay, children, now, the biggest skank
of all was an old fatass by the name of...

330
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:04,500
Marsh! Broflovski! McCormick! Cartman!
In my office!

331
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:11,600
Looks like that meth lab you took down
was the tip of the iceberg.

332
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:15,500
They found a paper trail leading all the
way to the biggest crime syndicate in Colorado.

333
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:20,450
The operators apparently run their business
out of a sleazy strip joint down in Inglewood.

334
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:23,000
They're all cop killers,
so I'm sending you in undercover.

335
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:27,200
Uh, sir, d'I have a lot of homework
to do tonight and I was...

336
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:30,300
What?! Now you listen to me!
I'm givin' you one last chance!

337
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:32,700
You're good cops, but you let
your emotions get in the way!

338
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:38,100
And your little "shoot first ask questions later"
technique has no place in this century!

339
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:41,900
Now you get down to that strip joint
and you do it by the books, you got it?!

340
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,500
The mayor is on my ass and blablablah!

341
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:52,200
So, what did you boys have to say
to the lieutenant?

342
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:54,300
Nothing, he just told us a bunch of stuff.

343
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:58,100
Maybe you decided you needed
to tell him about our... bonus money.

344
00:16:58,200 --> 00:16:58,900
No.

345
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:01,900
They're lying.

346
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:03,500
They're dead!

347
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:16,300
Dude, if my mom knew I was in here,
I would be in super big trouble.

348
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:24,100
Would you like a dance?

349
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:25,400
No thanks.

350
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:27,800
Dance? Anyone like a dance?

351
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:30,300
Well all right, guests, put your hands together.
Be sure to tip the dancers.

352
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:32,900
And now, come on, let's here it for Candy!

353
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:35,500
Whoa whoa, what the hell are you
kids doin' in here?

354
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,600
This isn't an appropriate place for children

355
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:41,200
Dance? Anyone like a dance?

356
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:43,200
Uh, it's okay. We know the owner.

357
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:45,100
Oh, really? Let's go see.

358
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:48,600
All right, so we'll have to start havin'
the McCormicks make our meth again and...

359
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:50,600
Hey Gino, these kids say they know you.

360
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:52,900
What? Ha-I don't know no kids.

361
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,200
I didn't think so. All right, you kids...

362
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:56,100
Hey wait a minute.

363
00:17:56,200 --> 00:18:00,100
These kids might be just what we need
to get our drugs past the security at DIA.

364
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:01,900
How would you like to join our family?

365
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:06,200
Yo Gino, I know I've seen these kids
before, man. These kids are 5-0!

366
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:07,000
What?

367
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:08,800
These kids are cops, man!

368
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Kenny, it doesn't go "Pakew! Pakew!",
it goes "BANG BANG BANG!!"

369
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:31,600
God damnit! Those junior detectives
and their heroicly reckless ways!

370
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:34,300
Murphy! Jenkins! Hopkins! Get in there!

371
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:45,200
Dance??? Anybody like a dance???

372
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:51,800
Freeze! South Park detectives!
Great job, boys. You found the meth boss!

373
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:56,600
Detective Murphy! Jenkins!
Uh what the hell are you doing?
We had a deal.

374
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:58,000
A deal?

375
00:18:58,300 --> 00:19:00,800
That's right. We're partners
in the drug business.

376
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:04,200
Everything was fine until these
"supercops" joined the force.

377
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:06,900
Now we've gotta kill you all.

378
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:07,800
Boys! Down!

379
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,700
Huh alright guys, put your hands together,
a lot of shootin' and killin' goin' on,

380
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:19,500
but be sure to tip your waitress
let's hear it for Rebecca.

381
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,100
Christ! Those junior detectives
have no regard for the law!

382
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:30,200
Get me a hard line to the phone!
And I want choppers on the roof!

383
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:31,100
Who the hell are you??

384
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:33,400
Agent Fields, FBI!

385
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:35,400
Hey, I'm in charge of this investigation.

386
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:37,000
Not anymore, you're not.

387
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:39,500
But that's not fair!

388
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,500
Is so! Is so!

389
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:52,400
Sorry, Detective Hopkins. We can't
let anybody know about our partnership.

390
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:55,100
That's right. We split it all, fifty-fifty!

391
00:19:55,300 --> 00:20:01,500
That's right. I think we'll take
a hundred percent now.

392
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:04,500
Huhuh yeah. Sorry, Gino,
but in business like this,

393
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:06,300
sometimes partnerships need to end.

394
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:11,400
That's right. Sometimes partnerships
need to end.

395
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:16,300
Well, supercops, looks like I'll be
taking in all the money now.

396
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:21,700
I'm in business alone. And that means
that the only person I can't trust...

397
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:23,200
...is myself.

398
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:32,700
Looks like Murphy and Jenkins
got what they deserved.

399
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:35,700
If it weren't for you boys, we would
have never cleaned up the department

400
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:40,500
All right, detectives, let's get one thing straight!
I do not agree with your methods!

401
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:46,400
You're uncontrolled, and you're negligent!
But by God you get the job done. Congratulations!

402
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:47,800
Thanks.

403
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:52,300
I'm probably going to regret this, but,
well, I'm promoting you to full detectives.

404
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:55,500
There'll be lots of action, and that
big paycheck you've always wanted.

405
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:59,500
I think I have a better idea.

406
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,200
Hello, sir. Welcome to the
Broflovski Laundromat.

407
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:05,800
Yes, I have a suit that needs to be
dry-cleaned. And pressed, please.

408
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:06,800
Certainly.

409
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:09,800
Here you are, Mister McCormick.
Your laundry is all done and folded.

410
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:12,600
That will be nine ninety five.
On your American Express.

411
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:16,200
Fellas! Hehey fellas! I got it!
Ah I got my semen sample!

412
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:17,000
You did?

413
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:20,400
Yeah. I was up there poundin' my weiner
for two days straight, aaand finally,

414
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:23,700
I thought about Stan's Mom's boobs,
and this little timy spooge of...

415
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:24,800
this white stuff came out.

416
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:26,500
That's great, Butters, but we're not
playing Detective anymore.

417
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:27,700
We're playing laundromat owners.

418
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:29,500
Would you like those pants cleaned
for four ninety five?

419
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:53,600
