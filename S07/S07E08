1
00:00:34,441 --> 00:00:37,016
Oh my God, you guys are not gonna believe what happened to me last night.

2
00:00:37,017 --> 00:00:38,238
What? Tell us?

3
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:42,598
So, I'm watching the season premiere of Boy Meets Boy on television, and then Queer Eye for the Straight Guy come on, right?

4
00:00:42,599 --> 00:00:47,924
So I fall asleep in front of the TV, and when I wake up, I see that I've spilled the Coke I was drinking all over my satin pajama top.

5
00:00:48,002 --> 00:00:50,995
Oh my Gosh, are you serious? That was the cutest top ever!

6
00:00:50,996 --> 00:00:51,826
I know!

7
00:00:51,861 --> 00:00:54,760
(I just LOVE this jacket 'cause it's SOOO beautiful!)

8
00:00:54,795 --> 00:00:56,234
Oh, tell me about it, Ken doll.

9
00:00:56,269 --> 00:00:57,178
Hey dudes.

10
00:01:02,124 --> 00:01:03,282
What a dork!

11
00:01:03,317 --> 00:01:03,972
What?

12
00:01:04,007 --> 00:01:07,355
Nice jacket, Kyle! Polyester is really the hot fabric this fall!

13
00:01:08,443 --> 00:01:10,642
Well, but, this is the jacket I always wear.

14
00:01:10,677 --> 00:01:12,300
You've gotta get with the times, girlfriend.

15
00:01:12,335 --> 00:01:14,525
Yeah, that jacket is so September 10th.

16
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:18,032
Oohh my God, you got splotches on your neck. Are you using any exfoliating products at all??

17
00:01:18,067 --> 00:01:20,208
We can't let Kyle out in public like this, you guys.

18
00:01:20,243 --> 00:01:21,326
(That's the truth.)

19
00:01:21,361 --> 00:01:22,859
Come on, Kyle! We're giving you a makeover!

20
00:01:22,894 --> 00:01:28,781
You... came into my life... and my world never looked so bright.

21
00:01:28,816 --> 00:01:32,371
It's true. You bring out the best in me.

22
00:01:32,406 --> 00:01:39,395
When you are around, when you are around, all things just keep getting better.

23
00:01:40,317 --> 00:01:46,877
It keeps getting better. Life keeps getting better and better (All things just keep getting better).

24
00:01:48,131 --> 00:01:52,634
Coming up on HBC, it's Queer Eye for the Staight Guy!

25
00:01:52,669 --> 00:01:55,105
We have got to get you some tighter-fitting shirts!

26
00:01:55,340 --> 00:02:01,933
Then it's Boy Meets Boy, followed by Will and Grace, and then, the Love Boat... with Men.

27
00:02:01,968 --> 00:02:05,910
My goodness, there certainly are a lot of gay shows on television these days.

28
00:02:05,945 --> 00:02:09,341
Yeah. I think it's great that gays are finally being so accepted.

29
00:02:10,023 --> 00:02:11,218
Hi Mom, Hi Dad!

30
00:02:12,945 --> 00:02:14,505
Kyle! What's happened to you??

31
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:17,211
I'm just trying to fit in, Daddy. Don't be such a drama queen!

32
00:02:19,015 --> 00:02:19,999
Oh my God!

33
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,075
Come on, Sheila!  We'd better go tell the other parents what's going on!!

34
00:02:24,844 --> 00:02:26,503
Oh hi Gerald, Sheila.

35
00:02:26,538 --> 00:02:28,745
Hi Sharon. Uh, we need to talk to you about the boys.

36
00:02:29,191 --> 00:02:31,447
Sure. Come on in. The guys are all watching TV.

37
00:02:31,482 --> 00:02:32,959
Oh, is the game on or something?

38
00:02:34,713 --> 00:02:37,681
Heeey Geraaald! How are youuuu!!

39
00:02:37,716 --> 00:02:39,106
Geraaald! Hi Gerald.

40
00:02:39,141 --> 00:02:41,946
Sit down, Jer-Jer! Queer Eye For the Straight Guy is on.

41
00:02:41,981 --> 00:02:44,399
Oh no! Y-you guys all turned gay too??

42
00:02:46,279 --> 00:02:49,118
Not gay, Gerald, metrosexual.

43
00:02:49,153 --> 00:02:49,821
What's that?

44
00:02:49,856 --> 00:02:54,986
Just because a guy cares about how he looks and is in touch with his feminine side doesn't mean he's gay anymore.

45
00:02:55,021 --> 00:02:59,255
Yeah. Metrosexual means you're straight, but you appreciate the gay culture.

46
00:02:59,290 --> 00:03:01,920
It's super-fabulous. Would you like some shirazz?

47
00:03:02,784 --> 00:03:04,129
Don't our men look

48
00:03:04,164 --> 00:03:06,676
Haven't you seen Quuer Eye For the Straight Guy, Sheila?

49
00:03:06,677 --> 00:03:07,677
These five gay men go around and show straight men how to better themselves. It's the best.

50
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,286
It is?

51
00:03:12,321 --> 00:03:14,949
Well sure, Sheila. Our husbands are all so clean and neat.

52
00:03:14,950 --> 00:03:17,668
My Randy irons his clothes and even has pedicures.

53
00:03:17,788 --> 00:03:21,280
And they like to talk about their feeling now and drink wine and decorate the house.

54
00:03:21,315 --> 00:03:25,228
My Steven shaved his chest and his balls. OOOO, I love it!

55
00:03:25,263 --> 00:03:26,690
And how about our boys, huh?

56
00:03:26,691 --> 00:03:31,244
Ever since gay culture became cool, our boys bathe every night and brush their teeth three times a day.

57
00:03:31,245 --> 00:03:33,015
This is the greatest thing ever.

58
00:03:33,021 --> 00:03:36,700
I don't know. Sometimes boys take cultural fads too far...

59
00:03:38,295 --> 00:03:40,654
Dude, I can't wait for Wendy to see how gay I look!

60
00:03:40,689 --> 00:03:41,605
That's true, you guys.

61
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:44,558
When the chicks at school see how gay we are, they're gonna be all over us.

62
00:03:44,798 --> 00:03:45,648
(Woohoo!!)

63
00:03:45,683 --> 00:03:50,268
All right. Let's work it!  What the...?

64
00:03:50,303 --> 00:03:53,115
Tootaloo, Connor. See ya after classies.

65
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:54,025
Okay, sweetums.

66
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:57,322
Oh my God, where is my homework?! I am fr-eaking a-out!

67
00:03:58,121 --> 00:03:59,024
Hey dudes.

68
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:00,929
Hey Craig.

69
00:04:00,964 --> 00:04:02,430
You guys look pretty gay.

70
00:04:02,465 --> 00:04:03,246
Thanks.

71
00:04:03,494 --> 00:04:05,189
Not as gay as us, though.

72
00:04:05,224 --> 00:04:07,693
Oh, please Craig, we're ten times gayer than you!

73
00:04:07,728 --> 00:04:10,022
Oh yeah?! We're superduper triple-dog gay!

74
00:04:10,057 --> 00:04:13,067
Oh yeah?! We're all just super stamp it stamp it no erasies mega gay!

75
00:04:13,102 --> 00:04:14,933
What's all this fightin' about, children?!

76
00:04:14,968 --> 00:04:16,947
These guys are trying to say they're gayer than us!

77
00:04:16,982 --> 00:04:22,485
Aw nah. Don't tell me you children have taken up this whole metrosexual fad, too!

78
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:25,261
Oh My God, this is not a fad, this is who we are!

79
00:04:25,262 --> 00:04:29,575
No it isn't. Last year you children were all trying to be black, and now you're trying to be gay!

80
00:04:30,175 --> 00:04:31,377
We're metrosexual!!

81
00:04:31,412 --> 00:04:34,714
Maybe. But you'll never be as metrosexual as us! Come on, fags!

82
00:04:34,749 --> 00:04:38,259
GOD I HATE CRAIG!!  That son of a... djah!!

83
00:04:39,226 --> 00:04:42,223
Chef, I don't feel very metrosexual.

84
00:04:42,778 --> 00:04:48,206
Well, then, don't buy into this fad, Kyle. Be who you are, not what's cool.

85
00:04:49,836 --> 00:04:52,098
All right children, let's take our seats.

86
00:04:52,728 --> 00:04:54,879
Good morning Mr. Garrison.

87
00:04:57,649 --> 00:05:00,340
Well, uh d-don't you all look nice.

88
00:05:00,375 --> 00:05:01,575
Oooo, Timmy.

89
00:05:04,911 --> 00:05:06,342
Dude! W-what are you doing?

90
00:05:06,377 --> 00:05:09,124
I didn't feel comfortable in that stuff, dude. I'm just being me.

91
00:05:09,159 --> 00:05:11,578
HA! Told you you guys were straight!

92
00:05:11,613 --> 00:05:12,821
We're not straight! You're straight!

93
00:05:12,856 --> 00:05:13,514
You're straight!

94
00:05:13,549 --> 00:05:14,794
You're straight like a freedway!

95
00:05:14,829 --> 00:05:16,343
What the hell is going on??

96
00:05:16,378 --> 00:05:18,805
You wish you were gay, Craig! In you dreams!!

97
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:20,612
I'm not just gay, I'm a catamite.

98
00:05:22,533 --> 00:05:24,537
...So? I'm half bisexual!

99
00:05:24,572 --> 00:05:27,268
Oh, stop it!! You kids don't even know what you're talking about!!

100
00:05:27,269 --> 00:05:29,146
Eric, you're not half-bi!!

101
00:05:29,283 --> 00:05:32,958
I'm like, a quarter-bi. My grandpa was bi, so that makes me quarter-bi.

102
00:05:32,993 --> 00:05:33,901
WHAT??

103
00:05:34,658 --> 00:05:37,857
It was the crazies thing I've ever seen, Mr. Slave. 

104
00:05:37,858 --> 00:05:41,482
All the children were suddenly acting like being gay was cool.

105
00:05:41,483 --> 00:05:45,127
I mean, maybe we're not the only gay couple in town anymore.

106
00:05:45,167 --> 00:05:47,025
Oh, Jethuth Chritht.

107
00:05:49,815 --> 00:05:56,369
Look at that, Mr. Slave.  Our cup runneth over.

108
00:05:56,404 --> 00:05:57,923
Jethuth Chritht.

109
00:05:57,958 --> 00:06:00,140
Mr. Garrison, those are great pants.

110
00:06:00,175 --> 00:06:02,397
Thanks, Jimbo. I really like your outfit, too. 

111
00:06:02,398 --> 00:06:07,059
Soho... so Jimbo, you... wanna come back to my place with me and Mr. Slave?

112
00:06:08,217 --> 00:06:09,668
Uh, for what?

113
00:06:09,703 --> 00:06:11,823
Well, you know...

114
00:06:11,858 --> 00:06:12,824
No.

115
00:06:14,363 --> 00:06:16,265
Mr. Garrison!  Hey doll.

116
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:17,206
Oh hey Randy.

117
00:06:17,241 --> 00:06:19,000
You're looking ultra-fabulous.

118
00:06:19,035 --> 00:06:20,755
Wull thanks. You too.

119
00:06:20,756 --> 00:06:25,803
So uh, Randy, you want me to give you a hand job in the bathroom?

120
00:06:25,958 --> 00:06:28,618
Nuno, thanks, I'm, I'm not like that.

121
00:06:28,653 --> 00:06:30,257
Not, not like that?

122
00:06:30,292 --> 00:06:32,487
How about some shirazz, guys?

123
00:06:32,522 --> 00:06:34,647
Uh-OH, thanks, Mr. Tweek.

124
00:06:34,682 --> 00:06:35,792
My pleasure, silly-buns.

125
00:06:35,827 --> 00:06:40,129
Oh, wuh, welluh, Mr. Tweek, why don't we uh, go back to my place.

126
00:06:40,164 --> 00:06:41,028
Why?

127
00:06:41,063 --> 00:06:43,717
Well, you know, I was just thinking we could... 

128
00:06:43,718 --> 00:06:48,089
put on some music and watch videos and pound Mr. Slave's tight little ass.

129
00:06:48,315 --> 00:06:50,078
Woohoohoohoo, Jethuth Chritht.

130
00:06:50,113 --> 00:06:52,540
Wohohoho, goodness no. I, I'm straight.

131
00:06:52,575 --> 00:06:53,465
Straight?

132
00:06:53,466 --> 00:06:56,915
Bu-uh, Oh what... Jesus, what the hell is goin' on here?!

133
00:06:57,780 --> 00:06:59,709
Why won't anybody pound Mr. Slave's butt?!

134
00:06:59,744 --> 00:07:02,939
Well, we don't "pound butt," Mr. Garrison, we're straight.

135
00:07:02,974 --> 00:07:06,163
Those pants and those shoes say you pound butt!!

136
00:07:06,198 --> 00:07:09,673
Heeey, now that's not true. My shoes don't say I pound butt.

137
00:07:09,708 --> 00:07:11,974
No, your shoes say you take it in the butt!!

138
00:07:12,009 --> 00:07:17,463
Sokay, Mr. Garrison. We learned that gays are totally cool. You're just one of us now.

139
00:07:18,334 --> 00:07:19,605
One of you?!

140
00:07:19,836 --> 00:07:24,133
We've spent our whole lives tryin' NOT to be one of you! You can't do this to us!!

141
00:07:25,818 --> 00:07:26,982
Have you guys seen this?

142
00:07:26,983 --> 00:07:30,298
It's a conditioner that you can leave in, and it detoxifies the scalp.

143
00:07:30,333 --> 00:07:31,714
Wow, is that from Origins?

144
00:07:31,749 --> 00:07:33,536
Yeah. It's a charcoal-based thing that-

145
00:07:33,571 --> 00:07:35,263
Hey guys. You wanna throw the football around?

146
00:07:36,102 --> 00:07:38,109
Guys, can I talk to you over here for a second?

147
00:07:39,951 --> 00:07:42,419
Look, guys, a lot of the kids in school are talking, okay?

148
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:46,583
And they're spreading rumors that we're not metrosexuals because... we hang out with Kyle.

149
00:07:46,694 --> 00:07:48,038
Well, what can we do about it?

150
00:07:48,073 --> 00:07:51,378
We have no choice, you guys. We're just gonna have to kill Kyle.

151
00:07:51,816 --> 00:07:54,229
What?? That's stupid. We wouldn't have to kill Kyle!

152
00:07:54,230 --> 00:07:56,221
We would just to tell him not to hang around us anymore.

153
00:07:56,327 --> 00:08:00,043
Oh, you know, you're right, Stan. We just have to tell Kyle not to hang around us anymore.

154
00:08:00,078 --> 00:08:01,202
Yeah. Wait, what?

155
00:08:01,237 --> 00:08:03,819
You hear that, Kenny? Stan thinks we should tell Kyle not to hang around us anymore. 

156
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:07,200
I think he's right. Good luck telling him, Stan. I... know it won't be easy.

157
00:08:07,344 --> 00:08:10,331
Hey, butch boy. Nice football you got there.

158
00:08:11,861 --> 00:08:14,339
When was the last guy you had a manicure, straight man?

159
00:08:14,909 --> 00:08:16,148
Yeah, let's see that hair.

160
00:08:16,610 --> 00:08:17,149
Look, he's not even using any product!

161
00:08:20,108 --> 00:08:21,283
Hey, what's goin' on?

162
00:08:21,665 --> 00:08:24,657
Oh, here come the butch boys to help their butchy little friend!

163
00:08:26,254 --> 00:08:27,829
He's not our friend.

164
00:08:31,437 --> 00:08:32,471
Stan?

165
00:08:36,162 --> 00:08:38,683
This playground is for metrosexuals, macho man!

166
00:08:38,718 --> 00:08:40,758
Take your non-flaming ass to some other school!

167
00:08:41,568 --> 00:08:43,075
No! Ah!

168
00:08:50,802 --> 00:08:53,190
Kyle! What happened to you?!

169
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,741
I got beat up at school... for being different.

170
00:08:56,776 --> 00:08:59,563
WHAT?? Your classmates beat you up for being a Jew?

171
00:08:59,598 --> 00:09:01,884
No! For not being a metrosexual.

172
00:09:01,919 --> 00:09:04,483
Gerald! Gerald, get down here!

173
00:09:04,518 --> 00:09:06,414
Heeere I come!

174
00:09:14,676 --> 00:09:16,773
Oh no! Dad's metrosexual too?

175
00:09:16,808 --> 00:09:18,922
Kyle! You look terrible!

176
00:09:18,957 --> 00:09:21,106
The boys at school beat him up, Gerald.

177
00:09:21,141 --> 00:09:23,725
Oh, really?! Well, don't you worry, Kyle.

178
00:09:23,726 --> 00:09:26,013
We can cover that black eye up with some cream base,

179
00:09:26,014 --> 00:09:27,014
and the coat and pants we'll bleach with an acid wash for a fun vintage look.

180
00:09:29,588 --> 00:09:31,077
Gah! Just leave me alone!

181
00:09:32,915 --> 00:09:35,400
There you go! Now you look fabulous.

182
00:09:35,435 --> 00:09:38,654
You see that? A spray-on tan does wonders for your look.

183
00:09:39,815 --> 00:09:42,403
Now let's get down to the tango class and learn some new steps.

184
00:09:42,438 --> 00:09:44,752
That does it! I know what I have to do!

185
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,465
Oh, hello, Mr. Garrison.

186
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:51,516
Chef, can I talk to you?

187
00:09:51,551 --> 00:09:53,090
Sure. Come on in.

188
00:09:53,125 --> 00:09:54,921
Thanks. Come, Slave.

189
00:09:58,254 --> 00:10:00,242
Oh, it's just awful, Chef!

190
00:10:00,243 --> 00:10:04,976
I used to feel like an outsider, a totally different person who stood out in this town!

191
00:10:04,977 --> 00:10:08,048
Now every straight guy is acting gayer than me!

192
00:10:08,132 --> 00:10:10,688
Oh Jethuth! Jethuth Chritht!

193
00:10:10,723 --> 00:10:12,191
Well, what do you want me to do about it?

194
00:10:12,226 --> 00:10:15,726
Chef, what did you do when white people stole your culture?

195
00:10:16,181 --> 00:10:19,482
Oh. Well, we black people just always tried to stay out in front of them.

196
00:10:19,517 --> 00:10:21,176
How did you do that?

197
00:10:21,211 --> 00:10:22,374
Well, like with our slang.

198
00:10:22,375 --> 00:10:26,208
Black people always used to say, "I'm in the house" instead of "I'm here."

199
00:10:26,209 --> 00:10:30,012
But then white people all started to say "in the house" so we switched it to "in the hizzouse."

200
00:10:30,013 --> 00:10:34,706
Hizzouse became hizzizzouse, and then white folk started saying that, and we had to change it to hizzie,

201
00:10:34,707 --> 00:10:37,579
...then "in the hizzle" which we had to change to "hizzle fo shizzle,"

202
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:40,109
...and now, because white people say "hizzle fo shizzle,"

203
00:10:40,110 --> 00:10:42,320
...we have to say ""flippity floppity floop."

204
00:10:43,606 --> 00:10:45,911
We don't have time for all that, Chef!

205
00:10:45,912 --> 00:10:50,364
Oh, if only those Queer Eye For the Straight Guy people understood what they were doing. 

206
00:10:50,365 --> 00:10:52,234
Wait. That's it! 

207
00:10:52,235 --> 00:10:54,306
I know exactly what to do!

208
00:10:54,307 --> 00:10:57,392
Come on, Mr. Slave! Let's get back to our flippity floppity floop.

209
00:10:57,771 --> 00:11:00,032
Oh no! Damnit! Don't call it that!

210
00:11:02,139 --> 00:11:03,999
One ticket to New York, please.

211
00:11:04,034 --> 00:11:05,985
You're going to New York alone?

212
00:11:06,020 --> 00:11:08,532
I'm going to see the Queer Eye For the Straight Guy people.

213
00:11:08,567 --> 00:11:11,309
Oooo, great idea! They can help you with those dated clothes.

214
00:11:26,126 --> 00:11:27,494
Mrrh.  Mr. Garrison?

215
00:11:27,529 --> 00:11:28,798
Kyle, what are you doing here?

216
00:11:28,833 --> 00:11:31,517
I'm going to New York to kill the Queer Eye For the Straight Guy people!

217
00:11:31,552 --> 00:11:33,522
What?? That's what I'm doing!

218
00:11:33,557 --> 00:11:36,132
Oh no! They ruined my life! I get to kill them first!

219
00:11:36,167 --> 00:11:39,265
They took gay culture from real gays and their asses are ours!

220
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:40,457
I thoght of it first!

221
00:11:40,492 --> 00:11:41,655
No you didn't! No you didn't!

222
00:11:41,690 --> 00:11:42,528
Did so! Did so!

223
00:11:42,563 --> 00:11:43,479
I thought of it yesterday!

224
00:11:43,514 --> 00:11:44,547
I thought of it two days ago!

225
00:11:44,582 --> 00:11:45,773
I thought of it before you were born!

226
00:11:45,808 --> 00:11:49,798
Stop it, you two! Stop it! Don't you see how crazy this is?

227
00:11:49,833 --> 00:11:54,524
Oh. You're right, Mr. Slave. We can both kill them together.

228
00:11:54,559 --> 00:11:55,384
Cool.

229
00:11:57,699 --> 00:11:58,969
Wow, we look great!

230
00:11:59,004 --> 00:12:01,033
Yeah, and let's see Craig outgay us now.

231
00:12:01,068 --> 00:12:04,334
Boys! Boys! Come on! There's a sale down in Express for Men!

232
00:12:06,142 --> 00:12:08,820
Hey guys! There's a sale in Express for Men!

233
00:12:09,014 --> 00:12:11,340
-Oh my God!
-Let's go! Let's go!

234
00:12:11,489 --> 00:12:13,974
You guys have got to see these shoes I bought!

235
00:12:14,009 --> 00:12:16,497
Hurry, you guys! The mall closes in seven hours!

236
00:12:16,498 --> 00:12:18,786
Oh, why can't we all live at the mall?!

237
00:12:19,898 --> 00:12:24,448
You know, I'm starting to think this whole metrosexual thing isn't so great.

238
00:12:24,483 --> 00:12:25,654
I know what you mean. 

239
00:12:25,655 --> 00:12:28,500
All my husband ever does now is look at himself in the mirror.

240
00:12:28,501 --> 00:12:31,388
He cares more about how he looks than how I look.

241
00:12:31,419 --> 00:12:34,484
I hope something happens soon to put an end to this whole fad.

242
00:12:36,810 --> 00:12:38,548
Guys, you've done a terrific job. 

243
00:12:38,549 --> 00:12:41,241
Queer Eye For the Straight Guy is our number one show!

244
00:12:42,622 --> 00:12:44,836
What can I say? We're fabulous.

245
00:12:44,871 --> 00:12:47,320
You guys are changing the world!

246
00:12:47,321 --> 00:12:52,286
And tomorrow, we're gonna have you make over the President of the United States!

247
00:12:52,308 --> 00:12:53,776
Oh my God, I think I'm gonna faint.

248
00:12:55,888 --> 00:12:57,212
Room service.

249
00:12:57,247 --> 00:12:59,512
What? We didn't order any room service.

250
00:12:59,547 --> 00:13:03,101
Oh, well, the woman at the front desk sent it up.

251
00:13:03,136 --> 00:13:06,180
Carol? Well, I'll have to check on this. Excuse me a minute, fellas.

252
00:13:10,792 --> 00:13:11,723
Clear!

253
00:13:11,758 --> 00:13:13,277
Okay, Mr. Slave!

254
00:13:18,046 --> 00:13:21,154
Unh, Jethuth  Chritht.

255
00:13:21,189 --> 00:13:23,091
Well crap, that didn't work.

256
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,487
You'd better shut up, Craig.

257
00:13:26,522 --> 00:13:27,633
Everyone knows it's true!

258
00:13:27,668 --> 00:13:28,461
It is not!

259
00:13:28,496 --> 00:13:29,098
Is so!

260
00:13:29,133 --> 00:13:30,542
Craig! Behave yourself!

261
00:13:30,577 --> 00:13:32,842
Yeah, Stanley. What are you fighting about?

262
00:13:32,877 --> 00:13:35,284
Dad, Craig is trying to say that his dad can outdress you!

263
00:13:35,319 --> 00:13:38,143
What? Son, that's a silly thing to fight about.

264
00:13:38,178 --> 00:13:41,089
Yeah. Everyone already knows I dress better than Randy.

265
00:13:41,124 --> 00:13:42,282
Oh really?!

266
00:13:42,317 --> 00:13:45,071
I mean, you do have the fashion sense of a Japanese woman.

267
00:13:46,357 --> 00:13:50,205
Please, girlfriend. You look like some kind of Little Orphan Annie nightmare.

268
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:52,237
Oh no, errrr!

269
00:13:52,272 --> 00:13:54,991
Oh, stop it! Will you all just stop it?!

270
00:13:56,202 --> 00:14:00,235
Look, you guys are carrying this fad too far! Will you please stop acting this way?!

271
00:14:01,116 --> 00:14:04,561
You don't... like us being metrosexual?

272
00:14:04,596 --> 00:14:05,387
NO!

273
00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:07,819
Well, you know what I think?

274
00:14:08,529 --> 00:14:10,709
I think you're all metrophobic!

275
00:14:10,744 --> 00:14:11,285
Yeah!!

276
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:11,958
What?

277
00:14:11,993 --> 00:14:16,825
We shouldn't be fighting amongst ourselves, we should be uniting against metrophobes like these!

278
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:17,914
This is crazy!

279
00:14:17,949 --> 00:14:22,237
Crazy? Different? Outcasts? Call us what you want.

280
00:14:22,238 --> 00:14:25,092
But us metros are real people, just like you!

281
00:14:25,183 --> 00:14:28,571
You can metrobash us all you want, but we're here to stay!

282
00:14:28,606 --> 00:14:30,738
Yeah Mom! We're proud of who we are.

283
00:14:30,773 --> 00:14:32,811
That's right. Proud. You know what I think, guys?

284
00:14:32,812 --> 00:14:35,354
I think we should have a metrosexual pride parade.

285
00:14:35,389 --> 00:14:38,373
Great idea, Eric! Raise metrosexual awareness!

286
00:14:38,408 --> 00:14:41,047
We can make floats and decorate them with streamers and flowers!

287
00:14:41,181 --> 00:14:42,047
(Woohoohoo!)

288
00:14:42,082 --> 00:14:45,102
Come on, fellas! Out of the malls and into the streets!

289
00:14:45,137 --> 00:14:47,766
Out of the malls and into the streets!

290
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,290
What the hell did that show do to them?

291
00:14:52,688 --> 00:14:54,902
You sure you don't want to press charges?

292
00:14:54,937 --> 00:14:57,841
That's okay, officer. I think they learned murder is wrong.

293
00:14:57,876 --> 00:14:59,514
Especially in those pants.

294
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:03,195
Look, guys, we're sorry we tried to murder you, but... 

295
00:15:03,196 --> 00:15:05,151
You have to stop what you're doing!

296
00:15:05,186 --> 00:15:07,854
Are you crazy?! We're the hottest thing on TV!

297
00:15:07,889 --> 00:15:11,505
But don't you see the price? You're selling out your own kind.

298
00:15:12,073 --> 00:15:16,514
Look, us gays have created a lifestyle, a, a culture that is uniquely ours. 

299
00:15:16,515 --> 00:15:21,291
If we keep trying to make straight people into us, well, we're gonna have no identity left.

300
00:15:24,576 --> 00:15:26,562
Sorry Charlie, no sale.

301
00:15:27,583 --> 00:15:30,808
Buh... but... this doesn't make sense!

302
00:15:30,809 --> 00:15:33,760
How can gay men do this to their own people??

303
00:15:34,044 --> 00:15:38,172
Unless... you're not gay at all...

304
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,208
You just had to push it, didn't you?!

305
00:15:44,243 --> 00:15:46,395
Just had to keep asking question!

306
00:15:48,177 --> 00:15:50,105
Now you know the truth!

307
00:15:50,140 --> 00:15:53,039
They aren't gay? Then what are they?

308
00:15:53,074 --> 00:15:56,676
We're a thousand years our kind have lived beneath the earth's crust!

309
00:15:56,677 --> 00:15:59,188
Banished by man in the Kindling Wars.

310
00:15:59,272 --> 00:16:00,774
Oh my God.

311
00:16:06,864 --> 00:16:09,725
We are the Crab People!

312
00:16:10,671 --> 00:16:11,969
Jethuth Chritht!

313
00:16:12,004 --> 00:16:18,367
Craaab People! Craaab People!

314
00:16:32,243 --> 00:16:35,881
See now where we have been forced to live for a thousand years! 

315
00:16:35,882 --> 00:16:40,600
But soon we shall rule the land above, and mankind will be gone!

316
00:16:40,909 --> 00:16:41,874
Gone??

317
00:16:46,102 --> 00:16:50,244
Crab people are too small and weak to take over man by force, 

318
00:16:50,245 --> 00:16:53,484
and so we came up with our perfect plan!

319
00:16:57,861 --> 00:17:01,269
If you can't beat man,  change man!

320
00:17:01,641 --> 00:17:02,586
I knew it! 

321
00:17:02,587 --> 00:17:05,259
I knew gay people would never do this to their own kind!

322
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:10,490
When all the world is metrosexual, the crab people shall finally reign supreme!!

323
00:17:11,172 --> 00:17:14,954
Craaab People! Craaab People!

324
00:17:14,989 --> 00:17:18,486
Taste like crab, talk like people.

325
00:17:18,521 --> 00:17:20,344
Craaab People!

326
00:17:21,114 --> 00:17:23,635
You'll never turn ME into a metrosexual!

327
00:17:23,636 --> 00:17:25,953
I like being a dirty, filthy little boy!

328
00:17:26,102 --> 00:17:29,676
Very well. If we can't make you into metrosexuals,

329
00:17:29,677 --> 00:17:33,074
...then we will make you into crab people!

330
00:17:33,075 --> 00:17:34,425
Take them!!

331
00:17:36,426 --> 00:17:39,057
All things just keep getting better

332
00:17:39,092 --> 00:17:40,791
You... came into my life

333
00:17:41,487 --> 00:17:45,475
and my world never looked so bright. Yeah.

334
00:17:45,510 --> 00:17:49,088
It's true. You bring out the best in me.

335
00:17:49,123 --> 00:17:52,096
When you are around, when you are around,

336
00:17:53,905 --> 00:17:56,345
All things just keep getting better.

337
00:17:57,476 --> 00:18:04,099
Tom, I'm standing in South Park, Colorado, where the first Metrosexual Pride Parade is underway!

338
00:18:07,744 --> 00:18:14,302
We're here! We're not queer!
But we're close! Get used to it!

339
00:18:14,303 --> 00:18:16,505
That does it! I can't take it anymore!

340
00:18:16,506 --> 00:18:19,370
I should have never wished for a cleaner, neater husband.

341
00:18:19,371 --> 00:18:22,723
Ladies, get yoru things! I know what we have to do!

342
00:18:26,347 --> 00:18:27,620
Whoa, look out!

343
00:18:30,241 --> 00:18:31,947
Oh my God, it's on fire!

344
00:18:31,982 --> 00:18:33,894
Put it out! Put it out!

345
00:18:33,929 --> 00:18:36,334
I can't do anything! These are brand-new pants!

346
00:18:36,369 --> 00:18:40,052
The heat could really damage our hair. We'd better let the police handle this!

347
00:18:40,087 --> 00:18:42,863
Are you crazy? I just had my uniform pressed!

348
00:18:42,898 --> 00:18:45,610
Oh Jesus, it's burning! Oh my God!

349
00:18:46,584 --> 00:18:48,901
Put it out! Put it out! Fire!

350
00:18:50,267 --> 00:18:53,508
Mr. President, it is such an honor to make you over!

351
00:18:53,543 --> 00:18:55,849
Now, we've got to do something with yoru hair.

352
00:18:55,884 --> 00:18:58,081
And your nails are filthy. Let's get those clean.

353
00:18:58,116 --> 00:18:59,698
This is gay gold!

354
00:19:00,287 --> 00:19:02,565
Stop them! They're crab people!

355
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:05,251
They cannot see or hear us, foolish man.

356
00:19:05,252 --> 00:19:09,193
Now stand by and watch as your pitiful race becomes helplesss!!

357
00:19:09,213 --> 00:19:13,821
That is very good, Mr. President. Now, put on this silk jacket.

358
00:19:13,856 --> 00:19:16,464
No Mr. President!! Don't do it! Help!

359
00:19:16,499 --> 00:19:17,511
You bastards!

360
00:19:17,546 --> 00:19:20,382
That looks great! Now, how about some moisturizer.

361
00:19:22,535 --> 00:19:24,026
There they are! Get 'em!

362
00:19:24,146 --> 00:19:24,970
What?

363
00:19:25,270 --> 00:19:27,807
You turned our husbands into whiny little wusses!!

364
00:19:27,842 --> 00:19:29,809
It's payback time!

365
00:19:33,842 --> 00:19:35,342
Oh my God, what are they doing?!

366
00:19:35,377 --> 00:19:37,204
Oh noooo!!

367
00:19:41,204 --> 00:19:44,172
Wha? What have you done?

368
00:19:44,207 --> 00:19:46,811
We're sorry, but we didn't have a choice.

369
00:19:46,812 --> 00:19:50,692
You see, at first we liked having our men be clean and neat.

370
00:19:50,693 --> 00:19:54,711
We thought that having them use product in their hair and wanting facials would make them sexier.

371
00:19:54,712 --> 00:19:55,942
But it doesn't.

372
00:19:55,970 --> 00:19:59,417
That's right. Event though my Steven sickens me out sometimes,

373
00:19:59,418 --> 00:20:02,283
it's his rugged manly grossness that I'm attracted to.

374
00:20:02,379 --> 00:20:06,970
We're sorry, but we knew that the only answer was tuh kill the Queer Eye guys.

375
00:20:07,005 --> 00:20:08,744
Well you're going to jail for thi-!

376
00:20:09,295 --> 00:20:11,576
Wait a minute.  What is that?

377
00:20:11,669 --> 00:20:15,618
No! Our evil plans! Noooo...

378
00:20:17,831 --> 00:20:20,844
Oh my God. They were crab people.

379
00:20:20,879 --> 00:20:21,816
Yes!

380
00:20:21,817 --> 00:20:26,030
They were tryingn to systematically make men into wusses so they could take over the world!

381
00:20:26,168 --> 00:20:27,964
-Mom!
-Kyle!

382
00:20:27,965 --> 00:20:32,327
I should have known they were crab people. They tried this before with The Jefferson.

383
00:20:32,362 --> 00:20:35,353
So now, can you please change your network's programming?

384
00:20:35,388 --> 00:20:38,523
Yes. Yes, I think this gay fad is over.

385
00:20:38,524 --> 00:20:40,365
Gentlemen, back to Studio 12!

386
00:20:40,366 --> 00:20:42,521
We're gonna bring back the Latin fad.

387
00:20:47,207 --> 00:20:48,392
Hey eses.

388
00:20:48,427 --> 00:20:50,625
Hey Jefey. You want some cerveiza?

389
00:20:53,886 --> 00:20:54,833
Kyle.

390
00:20:54,834 --> 00:20:57,080
Hey, ese. You wanna come play catch with us?

391
00:20:58,056 --> 00:21:00,686
What? Y-you want me to hang out with you?

392
00:21:00,721 --> 00:21:01,931
Yeah. It's cool, holmes.

393
00:21:02,576 --> 00:21:05,925
...No, dude, it really isn't cool. You all turned yoru backs on me. 

394
00:21:05,926 --> 00:21:09,479
You're supposed to be my best friends and you just... treated me like nothing! 

395
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:13,365
And now you all expect me to just forget it all and, and hang out with you again like nothing happened?

396
00:21:14,073 --> 00:21:17,372
Aw Jesus, Kyle, don't be such a whiny little gaywad! Come play catch with us.

397
00:21:17,407 --> 00:21:18,847
Yeah, don't be such a fag, dude!

398
00:21:29,570 --> 00:21:31,195
God-damnit!



9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
