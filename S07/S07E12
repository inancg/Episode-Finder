1
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,102
Okay, children, let's take our seats.

2
00:00:37,103 --> 00:00:41,679
We have a new student joining us today who has just moved here from Utah. 

3
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:45,004
I want you all to say hi to Gary.

4
00:00:46,584 --> 00:00:48,824
Hello, everbody. It's realy great to meet you all.

5
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,501
Gary was state champion in wrestling AND in tennis.

6
00:00:52,502 --> 00:00:56,512
He also maintained a 4.0 grade point average at his old school

7
00:00:56,513 --> 00:00:59,786
...AND has been on two national commercials for toothpaste.

8
00:00:59,821 --> 00:01:03,212
I'm really excited to live in this town and share all kinds of great experiences with you,

9
00:01:03,213 --> 00:01:04,487
...my new friends!

10
00:01:04,947 --> 00:01:06,617
Oh, dude, what a little asshole!

11
00:01:06,652 --> 00:01:07,453
Yeah, screw that kid!

12
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,601
All right, Gary, why don't you take that empty seat and we'll get started with the lesson?

13
00:01:15,156 --> 00:01:16,536
Hey. My name's Gary.

14
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:20,417
Hi. My name's Eura. Eura Fag.

15
00:01:22,004 --> 00:01:23,780
That's funny. You're cool, man.

16
00:01:23,815 --> 00:01:28,260
Okay now, who can tell me what year the first astronauts landed on the moon?

17
00:01:28,295 --> 00:01:30,332
Oh! Oh oh oh! Nineteen sixty nine!

18
00:01:30,367 --> 00:01:32,646
Very good, Gary. 

19
00:01:33,065 --> 00:01:33,647
Wow, looks like I don't have a class full of retards anymore, doesn't it, children?

20
00:01:40,359 --> 00:01:42,239
Dude, that new kid is such a douche!

21
00:01:42,274 --> 00:01:44,097
Yeah. Somebody need sto put him in him place!

22
00:01:44,132 --> 00:01:46,020
He's a peckerface, that's what he is!

23
00:01:46,055 --> 00:01:47,331
Go kick his ass, Stan.

24
00:01:47,366 --> 00:01:48,642
Yeah, go kick his ass.

25
00:01:48,677 --> 00:01:50,514
Wull, maybe he won't fight.

26
00:01:50,549 --> 00:01:52,085
Will he bleed? That's all we care about.

27
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:54,978
Come on, dude, somebody needs to wipe that fuckin' smirk off his face!

28
00:01:55,013 --> 00:01:56,179
Yeah, little bitch!

29
00:01:56,214 --> 00:01:57,725
All right, I'm gonna go kick his ass.

30
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:00,094
Yeah! Go Stan! Go Stan!

31
00:02:00,769 --> 00:02:03,076
All right, I've got five bucks on the other kid. Who wants in?

32
00:02:05,611 --> 00:02:07,756
Oh hey there! You wanna kick the ball around with me?

33
00:02:07,791 --> 00:02:10,788
No. I'm... I'm gonna kick your ass.

34
00:02:10,823 --> 00:02:12,118
Scuse me?

35
00:02:12,153 --> 00:02:14,335
I'm gonna kick your ass...  bitch.

36
00:02:15,676 --> 00:02:17,014
How come you wanna fight me? 

37
00:02:17,015 --> 00:02:19,749
...Oh, I get it. I'm the new kid.

38
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:21,637
Yeah, I guess maybe I deserve it.

39
00:02:22,161 --> 00:02:22,952
Huh?

40
00:02:22,987 --> 00:02:27,133
It's really tough being in a totally new place, but I think all you guys are really cool so... 

41
00:02:27,134 --> 00:02:29,437
I understand if there's initiation rites.

42
00:02:30,496 --> 00:02:31,668
Dude, stop it.

43
00:02:32,275 --> 00:02:34,743
-Let him have it, Stan!
-Shut up, Butters!

44
00:02:35,139 --> 00:02:38,659
The other kids are watching. Look, do what you gotta do. I won't fight back. 

45
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:41,773
I just hope that maybe afterwards we can... try to be friends someday.

46
00:02:42,702 --> 00:02:43,833
What are they doing?

47
00:02:43,868 --> 00:02:45,392
They're just standing there, talking.

48
00:02:48,262 --> 00:02:49,115
What happened?

49
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:52,544
I'm...  going over to his house for dinenr tonight.

50
00:02:53,085 --> 00:02:54,296
What?! How did that happen?

51
00:02:54,331 --> 00:02:56,733
He's a really nice kid.

52
00:02:56,768 --> 00:02:59,417
You were supposed to kick his ass, not lick his butthole!

53
00:02:59,452 --> 00:03:02,966
You're having dinenr with his family?
What kind of family has a kid like that?

54
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,213
Okay, my turn. Ooo, five! One two three four five.

55
00:03:09,214 --> 00:03:13,805
Uh, awww, lost yor mortgage, pay ten thousand dollars! Oh no!

56
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:15,976
Hey, it's Gary!

57
00:03:16,011 --> 00:03:16,708
Gary!

58
00:03:16,743 --> 00:03:17,448
Great to see you!

59
00:03:17,483 --> 00:03:18,099
How are you?

60
00:03:18,134 --> 00:03:21,357
Hey everybody! This is my new friend Stan. Stan, this is my mom and dad.

61
00:03:21,392 --> 00:03:22,221
Hi Stan!

62
00:03:22,256 --> 00:03:24,116
It's so nice to meet you.

63
00:03:24,151 --> 00:03:25,429
And this is my brother Mark.

64
00:03:25,464 --> 00:03:26,026
Hi!

65
00:03:26,061 --> 00:03:27,010
My sister Jenny.

66
00:03:27,045 --> 00:03:27,700
Hey!

67
00:03:27,735 --> 00:03:28,732
My little brother Dave.

68
00:03:28,767 --> 00:03:29,547
Hi!

69
00:03:29,582 --> 00:03:30,905
And my baby sister Amanda.

70
00:03:32,094 --> 00:03:33,285
Hello Stan!

71
00:03:34,621 --> 00:03:36,927
Well, it's great you could join us for Family Home Evening, Stan!

72
00:03:36,962 --> 00:03:37,894
What's that?

73
00:03:37,929 --> 00:03:41,199
That's when we don't allow any TV and just entertain each other with music and stories.

74
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,780
Doesn't your family ever do that?

75
00:03:42,815 --> 00:03:43,508
No.

76
00:03:43,543 --> 00:03:46,683
Hey kids! Why don't you grab your instruments and play a song for Stan!

77
00:03:46,718 --> 00:03:48,639
-Oh yeah!
-All right! Let's play!

78
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,083
<i>Yeah yeah, yeah, I love my family!</i>

79
00:03:52,118 --> 00:03:54,575
<i>My family is the best!</i>

80
00:03:54,610 --> 00:03:57,286
<i>If we ever have to face a challenge.</i>

81
00:03:57,321 --> 00:03:58,185
<i>My family!</i>

82
00:03:58,220 --> 00:03:59,282
<i>can pass the test.</i>

83
00:04:01,113 --> 00:04:04,121
Oh boy! Who is the best Mom in the world??

84
00:04:05,988 --> 00:04:07,380
All right! Go Dave!

85
00:04:08,439 --> 00:04:12,672
Where be your gibes now? Your gambols? Your songs?

86
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,692
That's a great story, Sarah.

87
00:04:17,727 --> 00:04:21,377
All right, kids, now how about we do some Scripture readings!

88
00:04:21,378 --> 00:04:23,324
From the Book of Mormon!

89
00:04:23,359 --> 00:04:24,602
All right!

90
00:04:25,744 --> 00:04:27,187
The... Book of Mormon? What's that?

91
00:04:27,222 --> 00:04:28,978
You know... the book that Joseph Smith found.

92
00:04:29,013 --> 00:04:30,340
Who's Joseph Smith?

93
00:04:31,731 --> 00:04:33,927
Only the most important person in the world.

94
00:04:33,962 --> 00:04:35,087
You've never heard of him?

95
00:04:35,122 --> 00:04:35,858
No!

96
00:04:36,086 --> 00:04:37,644
Tell us the story of Joseph Smith, Dad.

97
00:04:37,679 --> 00:04:39,495
Oh yes, tell us Dad. Yeah Dad. All right.

98
00:04:39,530 --> 00:04:41,785
All right, you rascals. Gather round.

99
00:04:42,085 --> 00:04:47,071
Joseph Smith lived in a little American town in the early 1800s.

100
00:04:51,490 --> 00:04:53,402
<i>Joseph Smith was called a prophet</i>

101
00:04:53,437 --> 00:04:55,358
<i>Dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb</i>

102
00:04:55,393 --> 00:04:57,733
<i>He started the Mormon religion</i>

103
00:04:57,768 --> 00:04:59,818
<i>Dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb</i>

104
00:04:59,853 --> 00:05:01,866
There goes that kooky Joseph Smith

105
00:05:01,901 --> 00:05:04,643
You know, he claims he spoke with God and Jesus.

106
00:05:04,678 --> 00:05:06,642
Well, how do you know he didn't?

107
00:05:06,677 --> 00:05:07,963
<i>Dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb</i>

108
00:05:07,998 --> 00:05:10,263
<i>Joseph Smith was called a prophet-</i>

109
00:05:10,298 --> 00:05:16,062
Hey, Joseph! I told my wife that you spoke with God and Jesus, and she didn't believe it.

110
00:05:16,097 --> 00:05:17,620
Well it's true. I did.

111
00:05:17,655 --> 00:05:18,442
Where?

112
00:05:18,477 --> 00:05:20,788
I was out in the woods, praying.

113
00:05:21,368 --> 00:05:25,300
I was asking God if I should be a Protestant, or a Catholic, or what?

114
00:05:25,301 --> 00:05:27,639
And suddenly God and Jesus appeared before me.

115
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:32,140
And they said I should start my own church, because none of the others had it right.

116
00:05:33,561 --> 00:05:35,819
And that's exactly how it happened.

117
00:05:35,854 --> 00:05:37,412
You see? You believe it now?

118
00:05:37,447 --> 00:05:39,548
Well yeah, sure. Why would he make that up?

119
00:05:39,583 --> 00:05:41,275
<i>Dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb</i>

120
00:05:41,661 --> 00:05:43,692
<i>Many people believed Joseph</i>

121
00:05:43,727 --> 00:05:45,661
<i>Dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb</i>

122
00:05:45,696 --> 00:05:47,825
<i>And that night he-ee saw an angel</i>

123
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:49,900
<i>Dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb</i>

124
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,725
And please bless Mother and Father, 

125
00:05:52,726 --> 00:05:55,781
...and please keep our bellies full of yum-yums and luscious goodies.

126
00:05:59,610 --> 00:06:00,874
Oh my gosh!

127
00:06:00,909 --> 00:06:04,276
I am Moroni. I am a Native American.

128
00:06:04,311 --> 00:06:07,672
A...  Native American?
But your skin is white.

129
00:06:07,707 --> 00:06:10,769
Yes. Long ago all Native American were white. 

130
00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:13,226
We all came to America from Jerusalem.

131
00:06:13,227 --> 00:06:16,288
And while we were here we were visited by Christ.

132
00:06:16,872 --> 00:06:18,966
Jesus live here in America?

133
00:06:19,001 --> 00:06:23,676
Yes. Eventually, my people were all killed by the other tribe of Israel,

134
00:06:23,677 --> 00:06:26,790
...and as punishment, God turned their skin red.

135
00:06:26,791 --> 00:06:29,786
These are the Native Americans you know today.

136
00:06:29,821 --> 00:06:31,725
<i>Dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb</i>

137
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:37,178
There is an ancient book buried near here, written on gold plates that account my people's lives. 

138
00:06:37,179 --> 00:06:41,412
Also buried with the book are two seer stones, the Urim and Thummim, 

139
00:06:41,413 --> 00:06:43,821
...which will allow you to translate the writings.

140
00:06:43,822 --> 00:06:46,694
Find it, and fulfill your destiny.

141

<i>Dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb</i>

<i>Dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb</i>

144
00:06:57,172 --> 00:06:59,612
And we all know what happened then, don't we?

145
00:06:59,647 --> 00:07:01,112
Yeah! I know!

146
00:07:01,147 --> 00:07:02,048
What happened then?

147
00:07:02,850 --> 00:07:04,728
Ooo, the Rice Crispy squares are done!

148
00:07:04,729 --> 00:07:08,403
Rice Crispy squares! Yay! All right! Rice Crispy squares!

149
00:07:08,404 --> 00:07:11,530
Hey gang, let's wrap some more of them up in plastic wrap and hand them out to the poor!

150
00:07:11,565 --> 00:07:12,951
Awesome! I can't wait!

151
00:07:13,427 --> 00:07:14,670
You coming, Stan?

152
00:07:14,705 --> 00:07:16,257
No, I was supposed to be home at eight.

153
00:07:16,292 --> 00:07:20,508
Awww, that's too bad. Well, it was really nice meeting you, Stan.

154
00:07:20,543 --> 00:07:21,187
Bye Stan!

155
00:07:21,222 --> 00:07:22,064
Great to meet you!

156
00:07:22,099 --> 00:07:22,730
Bye!

157
00:07:34,430 --> 00:07:35,374
...Hello?

158
00:07:35,648 --> 00:07:36,741
Oh, hi Stan.

159
00:07:37,857 --> 00:07:40,254
Hey Dad, how come you never told me about Joseph Smith?

160
00:07:40,663 --> 00:07:41,613
Who?

161
00:07:41,648 --> 00:07:43,756
Shut up, turd! We're watching Friends!

162
00:07:43,791 --> 00:07:45,487
The guy who spoke to God and Jesus.

163
00:07:45,522 --> 00:07:48,847
Well, Stan, God and Jesus don't actually speak to people.

164
00:07:48,882 --> 00:07:50,306
That's not what the Harrisons said.

165
00:07:50,341 --> 00:07:51,485
Who are the Harrisons?

166
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,211
The new people that moved in down the street.

167
00:07:53,212 --> 00:07:57,160
Mr. Harrison said that Joseph Smith spoke to God and Jesus and they told him none of the religions were right.

168
00:07:57,282 --> 00:08:00,644
Oh, did he now?! What are they, religious kooks?!

169
00:08:00,679 --> 00:08:01,879
They're not kooks, they're cool.

170
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:05,840
I mean, how come we never have a night where we don't watch any TV and we just... do stuff together and eat and drink?

171
00:08:05,978 --> 00:08:08,456
We have that, Stan. It's called Friday Night Kegger.

172
00:08:08,491 --> 00:08:09,652
But that's just you and your friends.

173
00:08:09,687 --> 00:08:11,215
I said shut up, turd!

174
00:08:11,378 --> 00:08:15,425
Mr. Harrison said that I should be followng Heavenly Father's plan, and I don't even know what that is.

175
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:16,994
All right, that does it!

176
00:08:17,029 --> 00:08:18,170
Where are you going?

177
00:08:18,205 --> 00:08:20,957
I'm gonna go have a talk with this "Mr. Harrison."

178
00:08:20,958 --> 00:08:25,112
If he thinks he can fill my son's head with wacko religious crap, he's wrong!

179
00:08:25,686 --> 00:08:27,291
Randy, don't cause trouble.

180
00:08:27,326 --> 00:08:31,790
Let me handle this, Sharon. You gotta put these cult people in their place or else they never stop!

181
00:08:31,791 --> 00:08:34,166
I'm gonna go kick this Mr. Garrison's ass! 

182
00:08:36,598 --> 00:08:38,718
This, Mr. Garrison is, is a white guy, right?

183
00:08:38,783 --> 00:08:39,423
Yeah.

184
00:08:39,458 --> 00:08:41,000
Jyeah, I'm gonna go kick his ass!

185
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,883
God-damned religious kooks! Tell my son what to believe, will you?!

186
00:08:47,884 --> 00:08:50,534
We'll see how you like my fist in your ass!

187
00:08:52,813 --> 00:08:54,248
Hello!

188
00:08:54,283 --> 00:08:56,059
Yeah, are you Mr. Harrison?

189
00:08:56,094 --> 00:08:58,148
I sure am.  The, the name's Gary.

190
00:08:58,183 --> 00:09:00,968
Well, look, my kid was just over at your house and he a-

191
00:09:01,003 --> 00:09:04,206
Oh, you're Stan's dad! It's so nice to finally meet you!

192
00:09:04,207 --> 00:09:05,207
Karen! Mr. Marsh is here!

193
00:09:06,221 --> 00:09:07,927
Uh, look, I just want to tell you that

194
00:09:07,962 --> 00:09:11,465
Oh, Mr. Marsh! What a treat! It's so nice to meet you!

195
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:13,383
Well, thanks. Uh...

196
00:09:13,418 --> 00:09:17,048
Karen just finished baking the most amazing Rice Crispy squares.

197
00:09:17,083 --> 00:09:18,204
With chocolate frosting

198
00:09:18,239 --> 00:09:21,416
Come on out of the cold. You've gotta try one. Or six.

199
00:09:23,602 --> 00:09:26,465
I cannot tell you how wonderful it is to have you over.

200
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:29,069
I hear you're a geologist. That is so amazing.

201
00:09:29,104 --> 00:09:34,377
Look, uh, I actually came over because I'm a little concerned about some of the things you told my son.

202
00:09:34,412 --> 00:09:35,226
Uh huh?

203
00:09:36,376 --> 00:09:40,111
You know. About... God, and stuff.

204
00:09:40,146 --> 00:09:44,481
Oooh... Oh boy... you think we were trying to convert him.

205
00:09:44,516 --> 00:09:45,442
Well, I-

206
00:09:45,477 --> 00:09:48,278
Oh, Mr. Marsh, I am sooo sorry.

207
00:09:48,313 --> 00:09:51,924
We just moved here from Utah and we're so used to everyone being Mormon that we... 

208
00:09:51,925 --> 00:09:55,823
Oh, we forget not everyuone wants to hear about it. Oh boy, you must be furious!

209
00:09:56,090 --> 00:09:58,377
Well, no, no, I just-

210
00:09:58,412 --> 00:10:02,247
"You just heard your son talking about religious ideals that aren't your own and you said 

211
00:10:02,248 --> 00:10:04,850
"Who the heck do these people think they are?!" 

212
00:10:05,135 --> 00:10:08,337
I I'm really, truly sorry, Mr. Marsh. It won't happen again.

213
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:10,782
Y-you can call me... Randy.

214
00:10:10,817 --> 00:10:14,019
Randy, the last thing we want is for people to think we're pushing our religion.

215
00:10:14,020 --> 00:10:17,003
We know there are a lot of beliefs out there and ours just works for us.

216
00:10:17,333 --> 00:10:18,374
To each his own, right?

217
00:10:21,930 --> 00:10:25,937
You know, to be honist, I've never known any Mormons. I, don't even know what you people believe. 

218
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:28,268
Who was this Joseph Smith guy?

219
00:10:28,269 --> 00:10:32,142
Why did he believe that Native Americans are actually white people from Jerusalem?

220
00:10:32,382 --> 00:10:35,858
Well, because they found ancient books they had written on gold plates,

221
00:10:35,859 --> 00:10:38,695
...right where the angel Moroni said they would be.

222
00:10:43,023 --> 00:10:45,393
I found them! I found them!

223
00:10:46,101 --> 00:10:48,653
You're not gonne believe it, everybody! I found them!

224
00:10:48,691 --> 00:10:50,070
Found what?

225
00:10:50,105 --> 00:10:52,722
Another New Testament of Jesus Christ!

226
00:10:52,757 --> 00:10:56,268
What? What did he say? Are you crazy?

227
00:10:56,303 --> 00:11:00,575
Last night, a Native America angel told me where I could find another testament of Jesus Christ,

228
00:11:00,576 --> 00:11:02,112
so I went out to the woods.

229
00:11:02,530 --> 00:11:05,179
I dug around all morning where the angel had told me to look.

230
00:11:06,031 --> 00:11:07,936
Maybe there isn't anything out here. 

231
00:11:08,926 --> 00:11:10,873
Wait a tick!  What's this?

232
00:11:13,676 --> 00:11:17,549
Inside the stone box, I found the magical seer stones.

233
00:11:17,550 --> 00:11:21,637
Under that, I found four gold plates written in strange writing.

234
00:11:21,822 --> 00:11:24,554
This must be the Gospel that Jesus told the Nephites!

235
00:11:25,096 --> 00:11:27,633
Well, they were the most amazing things I'd ever gazed upon.

236
00:11:27,668 --> 00:11:29,433
Well, so where are they?

237
00:11:29,468 --> 00:11:30,556
Where are what?

238
00:11:30,591 --> 00:11:33,375
The gold plates and the seer stones. Where are they?

239
00:11:33,410 --> 00:11:36,448
Oh. Oh, well, I... was not allowed to take them. 

240
00:11:36,449 --> 00:11:40,755
You see, after I found the plates, the angel Moroni appeared to me again 

241
00:11:40,756 --> 00:11:45,371
...and said that I am not allowed to show the plates, or the seer stones, to anybody.

242
00:11:45,372 --> 00:11:50,298
Because first I must translate what's written on the plates into English, so you can all read it!

243
00:11:50,422 --> 00:11:51,991
<i>Dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb</i>

244
00:11:52,507 --> 00:11:54,341
Wow, amazing!

245
00:11:56,315 --> 00:11:58,479
<i>He found the stones and golden plates</i>

246
00:11:58,514 --> 00:12:00,490
<i>Dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb</i>

247
00:12:00,525 --> 00:12:02,774
<i>Even though nobody else ever saw them</i>

248
00:12:02,809 --> 00:12:04,736
<i>Dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb</i>

249
00:12:10,294 --> 00:12:14,354
So, how'd it go, Clubber Lange?
You kicked Mr. Harrison's ass?

250
00:12:14,389 --> 00:12:19,170
Not exactly. We're uh, having their family over for dinner tomorrow night.

251
00:12:19,205 --> 00:12:20,803
See? That's what happened to me!

252
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:26,816
Sharon, did you know this guy Joseph Smith found a new testament to the Bible buried here in America?

253
00:12:26,851 --> 00:12:28,080
What are you talking about?

254
00:12:28,115 --> 00:12:31,650
Well it's just that... the Harrisons are really nice people and... 

255
00:12:31,651 --> 00:12:34,371
you should see how loving and together their family is. I,

256
00:12:34,372 --> 00:12:36,681
I think there's something to that religion.

257
00:12:36,805 --> 00:12:38,458
That's what they made me think, too!

258
00:12:38,493 --> 00:12:42,641
All right, that does it. From now on, our family is Mormon!

259
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,332
Hey Stan, how was your date last night with the new kid?

260
00:12:47,367 --> 00:12:51,524
Shut up, dude. They're a nice family and... Gary is actually really smart and talented.

261
00:12:51,770 --> 00:12:54,957
Aww, you guys. I think Stan's in love.

262
00:12:54,992 --> 00:12:56,564
Yeah. Did you make out with him, too?

263
00:12:56,599 --> 00:12:58,223
What's the big deal? Can't I have other friends?

264
00:12:58,224 --> 00:12:59,850
You guys should give Gary a chance.

265
00:13:00,075 --> 00:13:00,855
Hey Stan.

266
00:13:00,890 --> 00:13:02,811
Ohhh, here's Stan's little girlfriend now.

267
00:13:02,846 --> 00:13:07,022
Hey guys. Stan, I remember you said last night that you'd lost your wallet, so I made you a new one.

268
00:13:07,575 --> 00:13:09,913
I carved a picture of John Elway into the leather on the front.

269
00:13:10,255 --> 00:13:11,952
Wow, you made this?

270
00:13:11,987 --> 00:13:14,552
Awww, look at them. Aren't they so cute together?

271
00:13:14,587 --> 00:13:17,823
Hey! My family's on their way over to the fire station to donate blood.

272
00:13:17,824 --> 00:13:19,058
You wanna come along?

273
00:13:19,724 --> 00:13:22,414
Un, I don't think so, Gary. I have to uh...

274
00:13:22,449 --> 00:13:23,529
Oh here comes my family now!

275
00:13:25,093 --> 00:13:26,110
Hey you guys!

276
00:13:26,145 --> 00:13:28,669
Look, we painted our faces!

277
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,077
I'm a lion.

278
00:13:31,112 --> 00:13:32,154
I'm an alien.

279
00:13:32,189 --> 00:13:35,172
Hey, just what the heck am I supposed to be?

280
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,050
Oh my God...

281
00:13:38,085 --> 00:13:40,143
You gonna come with us to the fire station, Stan?

282
00:13:40,178 --> 00:13:42,145
Uh, no. I've got a lot to do.

283
00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:45,159
Well... Gary, you wanna just hang out with your friend Stan?

284
00:13:45,194 --> 00:13:48,942
Oh. Well, I'd like to, but... Oh man, I would miss you guys so much!

285
00:13:48,977 --> 00:13:50,604
We'd miss you too, Gary. Heh.

286
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:53,882
Aw, we'll all see each other tonight when we go to Stan's house for dinner. 

287
00:13:53,883 --> 00:13:55,708
Stay and play with your friend, Gary.

288
00:13:55,743 --> 00:13:57,283
Yeah. Have a good time, boys.

289
00:13:59,146 --> 00:14:00,120
Let's go.

290
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,674
Our faces are painted.

291
00:14:04,839 --> 00:14:05,693
Wow!

292
00:14:06,339 --> 00:14:07,609
So what do you guys wanna do?

293
00:14:07,644 --> 00:14:10,077
Uh, that's cool. We're gonna leave you two lovebirds alone.

294
00:14:10,078 --> 00:14:13,205
The three of us have to go put in some volunteer work at the homeless shelter.

295
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:15,077
Oh cool! I'm gonna do that tomorrow.

296
00:14:15,112 --> 00:14:17,233
Eeheehee, Jesus Christ.

297
00:14:20,279 --> 00:14:23,493
So hey, I heard your dad came over last night and he and my dad talked about Joseph Smith.

298
00:14:23,494 --> 00:14:24,365
That's great!

299
00:14:25,471 --> 00:14:27,701
Yyeah. I had a question about that Joseph Smith guy.

300
00:14:27,736 --> 00:14:28,400
Sure.

301
00:14:28,435 --> 00:14:30,887
What happened after he found the golden plates buried in the ground?

302
00:14:30,922 --> 00:14:33,042
Well, he kept them hidden from everyone like he was told. 

303
00:14:33,043 --> 00:14:36,322
And then he translated what was written on the plates into the Book of Mormon.

304
00:14:36,604 --> 00:14:37,521
Yeah, but... how?

305
00:14:40,227 --> 00:14:41,839
<i>Dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb</i>

306
00:14:41,874 --> 00:14:44,101
What's this all about, Mr. Smith?

307
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:46,808
Mr. Harris, can you keep a secret?

308
00:14:46,843 --> 00:14:47,798
Well, sure I can.

309
00:14:47,833 --> 00:14:54,853
I have, in my possession, an ancient book written on gold plates that tells of Jesus Christ's second coming.

310
00:14:54,854 --> 00:14:56,463
Here, in America.

311
00:14:56,791 --> 00:15:00,515
In America? Really? That sounds kind of...

312
00:15:01,034 --> 00:15:02,945
<i>Dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb</i>

313
00:15:03,386 --> 00:15:08,556
It's true. And I'm going to translate the plates and publish it into a book for the whole world to read. 

314
00:15:08,557 --> 00:15:11,519
Now, ahah-I know you have a lot of money, Mr. Harris,

315
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:14,720
...and I'm just gonna need a little bit to pay for the publishing costs.

316
00:15:14,753 --> 00:15:17,831
Mmm, I don't know. Uh, how do you expect to translate it?

317
00:15:18,125 --> 00:15:19,584
With these.

318
00:15:20,070 --> 00:15:20,931
Rocks?

319
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,559
They're not rocks. They're seer stones, given to me by an angel.

320
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:28,135
With them, God allowed me to translate the plates into English.

321
00:15:28,136 --> 00:15:31,762
Watch. You take this quill and paper and write down what I say.

322
00:15:31,763 --> 00:15:34,411
Sit here. I have the golden plates here in this hat.

323
00:15:34,412 --> 00:15:37,189
I need to have them somewhere dark so I can read the spiritual light.

324
00:15:37,237 --> 00:15:38,503
Really?

325
00:15:38,538 --> 00:15:40,394
Now, when I put the seer stones into the hat,

326
00:15:40,395 --> 00:15:44,302
...the ancient letter light up and change into English, which I can then read to you.

327
00:15:44,665 --> 00:15:45,681
Wow!

328
00:15:48,689 --> 00:15:50,047
"Ooo, I'm seeing the light.

329
00:15:50,048 --> 00:15:51,978
Oh, okay. Write this down.

330
00:15:51,979 --> 00:16:00,885
"And... so... it... was... that... Christ... appeared before... the... Nephites."

331
00:16:01,420 --> 00:16:03,742
<i>And that's how the Book of Mormon was written</i>

332
00:16:03,777 --> 00:16:05,606
<i>Dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb</i>

333
00:16:05,641 --> 00:16:07,737
<i>Dumb dadumb dumb dumb dumb dumb</i>

334
00:16:07,772 --> 00:16:09,647

<i>Dumb dumb dumb dumb duuumb, duuumb.</i>

337
00:16:16,306 --> 00:16:19,937
One two three four. "Pay one thousand dollars property tax."

338
00:16:20,682 --> 00:16:24,083
Isn't this great, you guys? Our first Family Home Evening.

339
00:16:24,144 --> 00:16:25,848
I wanna watch TV.

340
00:16:26,075 --> 00:16:30,236
We're not watching TV! We're Mormons now and we're having Family Home Evening!

341
00:16:30,271 --> 00:16:33,462
Dad, did you know that that Joseph Smith guy read the Book of Mormon out of a hat?

342
00:16:33,497 --> 00:16:35,099
And? Your turn, Sharon.

343
00:16:35,134 --> 00:16:37,796
It's just that... the Book of Mormon says a lot of strange stuff,

344
00:16:37,797 --> 00:16:40,573
...like that Adam and Eve lived in Jackson County, Missouri.

345
00:16:40,626 --> 00:16:41,402
Yes.

346
00:16:41,437 --> 00:16:44,156
But school taught me that the first man and woman lived in Africa.

347
00:16:44,191 --> 00:16:46,581
Well you can't believe everything school tells you, Stan.

348
00:16:46,582 --> 00:16:47,905
Your turn, Shelley.

349
00:16:48,616 --> 00:16:50,487
Oooo, that must be the Harrisons!

350
00:16:52,556 --> 00:16:53,895
Hey everybody.

351
00:16:54,504 --> 00:16:56,309
Wow, what a great house!

352
00:16:56,344 --> 00:17:00,075
You must be Mrs. Marsh; it's so nice to meet youuu!

353
00:17:00,110 --> 00:17:03,169
And you must be Stan's sister. Oh, I think your brother's the greatest.

354
00:17:03,204 --> 00:17:05,549
My brother is a stupid turd.

355
00:17:05,584 --> 00:17:06,816
Hey Stan.

356
00:17:06,851 --> 00:17:07,544
Hey Gary.

357
00:17:07,579 --> 00:17:10,587
Well, come on in and sit down, everybody. You're here just in time.

358
00:17:10,588 --> 00:17:13,686
My son was having a little problem with our new religion.

359
00:17:13,776 --> 00:17:14,469
Dad!

360
00:17:14,504 --> 00:17:20,260
Ohohoho, really? Wel, that's just because he hasn't heard the best part about the Joseph Smith story! 

361
00:17:20,261 --> 00:17:22,923
The one that proves he was for real!

362
00:17:22,999 --> 00:17:24,203
Yeah! Woohoo!

363
00:17:24,238 --> 00:17:25,230
Ooo, what's that?

364
00:17:25,265 --> 00:17:30,985
Well, you remember Martin Harris, the rich man who wrote down what Joseph Smith read out of the hat?

365
00:17:31,030 --> 00:17:31,786
Yeah.

366
00:17:31,821 --> 00:17:37,336
See, after he was done, he took some of the pages of what would become the Book of Mormon home.

367
00:17:37,639 --> 00:17:39,516
<i>Martin went home to his wife</i>

368
00:17:39,551 --> 00:17:41,287
<i>Dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb</i>

369
00:17:41,322 --> 00:17:43,671
<i>And showed her pages from the Book of Mormon</i>

370
00:17:43,706 --> 00:17:45,685
<i>Dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb</i>

371
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:51,362
A-and so Joseph Smith put his head into a hat, a-and read to me what the golden plates said.

372
00:17:51,363 --> 00:17:54,114
I wrote it all down and we're gonna publish it into a book.

373
00:17:54,688 --> 00:18:00,609
Martin, how do you know he isn't just making stuff up and pretending he's translating off golden plates?

374
00:18:00,644 --> 00:18:02,865
<i>Lucy Harris smart smart smart</i>

375
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:04,788
<i>Smart smart smart smart smart</i>

376
00:18:05,222 --> 00:18:06,720
Why would he make it up?

377
00:18:06,755 --> 00:18:09,264
<i>Martin Harris dumb dadumb-</i>

378
00:18:09,299 --> 00:18:11,762
All right, here. I'm gonna hide these pages. 

379
00:18:11,763 --> 00:18:16,108
If Joseph Smith really is translating off of golden plates, then he'll be able to do it again.

380
00:18:16,109 --> 00:18:20,405
But if Joseph Smith is making it all up, then the new translations will be different from these.

381
00:18:20,699 --> 00:18:24,003
Okay, fine. I bet he'll have no problem.

382
00:18:24,038 --> 00:18:26,096
<i>Lucy Harris smart smart smart</i>

383
00:18:26,131 --> 00:18:28,011
<i>Martin Harris dumb.</i>

384
00:18:28,046 --> 00:18:30,207
<i>So Martin went on back to Smith</i>

385
00:18:30,242 --> 00:18:32,127
<i>Said the pages had gone away</i>

386
00:18:32,162 --> 00:18:34,512
<i>Smith got mad and told Martin</i>

387
00:18:34,547 --> 00:18:36,381
<i>He needed to go pray</i>

388
00:18:36,416 --> 00:18:38,595
<i>Dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb</i>

389
00:18:39,689 --> 00:18:42,585
Look, ah I'm sorry about losin' the pages we worked on, Joe, 

390
00:18:42,586 --> 00:18:46,039
but I'm ready to write it all down again if you translate from the plates.

391
00:18:46,071 --> 00:18:49,991
I would love to, Martin, except, I just had a vision. 

392
00:18:49,992 --> 00:18:53,643
And the Lord said he's very angry with me for letting you take those pages.

393
00:18:54,234 --> 00:18:55,078
He is??

394
00:18:55,547 --> 00:18:57,229
<i>Dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb</i>

395
00:18:57,264 --> 00:19:02,060
Yes. He is so mad that he will never let me translate from the plate of Lehi again.

396
00:19:02,061 --> 00:19:05,470
He's... we must now translate from the plate of Nephi.

397
00:19:05,471 --> 00:19:09,175
So it will be the same basic story, but written a little differently.

398
00:19:10,147 --> 00:19:15,053
Wow! If God got angry with you, then you must be tellin' the truth.

399
00:19:15,088 --> 00:19:17,161
<i>Dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb.</i>

400
00:19:17,196 --> 00:19:19,022
All right, Martin. Let's get to work!

401
00:19:23,202 --> 00:19:24,912
And that's how it happened.

402
00:19:24,947 --> 00:19:26,511
Yeah! All right!

403
00:19:29,373 --> 00:19:33,999
...Wait. Mormons actually know this story and they still believe Joseph Smith was a prophet?

404
00:19:34,034 --> 00:19:36,105
Well sure. The story proves it, doesn't it?

405
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:39,116
No, it proves he DID make it all up. Are you blind?

406
00:19:39,151 --> 00:19:41,127
Well, Stan, it's all a matter of faith.

407
00:19:41,162 --> 00:19:42,536
No, it's a matter of logic!

408
00:19:42,537 --> 00:19:46,279
If you're gonna say things that have been proven wrong, like that the first man and woman lived in Missouri,

409
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:49,817
...and that Native Americans came from Jerusalem, then you'd better have something to back it up.

410
00:19:49,818 --> 00:19:53,706
All you've got are a bunch of stories about some asswipe who read plates nobody ever saw out of a hat,

411
00:19:53,707 --> 00:19:56,266
...and then couldn't do it again when the translatios were hidden!

412
00:19:56,301 --> 00:19:58,761
Hey, Stan, don't denounce our religion.

413
00:19:58,796 --> 00:20:00,801
I don't wanna be Mormon, Dad!

414
00:20:00,836 --> 00:20:01,802
Me neither.

415
00:20:02,330 --> 00:20:04,834
Hey, that's only cool, guys. You can believe whatever you want!

416
00:20:04,869 --> 00:20:07,177
Yeah, it's great you have your own beliefs.

417
00:20:07,212 --> 00:20:08,988
Yeah! Hooray for the Marshes!

418
00:20:09,261 --> 00:20:10,383
Oh, stop it!

419
00:20:10,384 --> 00:20:13,981
That's another thing! Why do you have to be so freakin' nice all the time?! It isn't normal!

420
00:20:13,982 --> 00:20:17,581
You just weasel people into your way of thinking by acting like the happiest family in the world

421
00:20:17,582 --> 00:20:21,062
...and being so nice to everyone that you just blindside dumb people like my Dad!

422
00:20:21,508 --> 00:20:22,324
Yeah!

423
00:20:27,944 --> 00:20:29,309
Well kids... 

424
00:20:29,925 --> 00:20:32,046
Who's up for a water balloon fight?!

425
00:20:32,081 --> 00:20:33,941
Yeah! All right!

426
00:20:38,285 --> 00:20:40,607
Oh, hey Stan. Where's your best buddy, Gary?

427
00:20:40,642 --> 00:20:42,062
I'm not hanging around that kid anymore.

428
00:20:42,380 --> 00:20:43,909
Oh no! You guys broke up?

429
00:20:44,285 --> 00:20:45,980
You guys were right, okay? The new kid's a douche.

430
00:20:45,981 --> 00:20:48,286
Now I just gotta find a way to keep him away from me.

431
00:20:49,117 --> 00:20:50,134
Hey Stan.

432
00:20:50,169 --> 00:20:50,987
Oh brother.

433
00:20:51,022 --> 00:20:52,656
Uh oh, the jilted lover returns.

434
00:20:52,691 --> 00:20:56,090
Listen, I just wanted to let you know you don't have to worry about me tryin' to be your friend anymore.

435
00:20:56,125 --> 00:20:57,121
I don't?

436
00:20:57,156 --> 00:21:00,761
Look, maybe us Mormons do believe in crazy stories that make absolutely no sense,

437
00:21:00,762 --> 00:21:04,116
and maybe Joseph Smith did make it all up, but I have a great life.

438
00:21:04,117 --> 00:21:07,202
and a great family, and I have the Book of Mormon to thank for that. 

439
00:21:07,203 --> 00:21:09,913
The truth is, I don't care if Joseph Smith made it all up,

440
00:21:09,914 --> 00:21:14,175
because what the church teaches now is loving your family, being nice and helping people.

441
00:21:14,176 --> 00:21:18,192
And even though people in this town might think that's stupid, I still choose to believe in it.

442
00:21:18,588 --> 00:21:20,430
All I ever did was try to be your friend, Stan,

443
00:21:20,431 --> 00:21:23,550
but you're so high and mighty you couldn't look past my religion and just be my friend back.

444
00:21:23,551 --> 00:21:25,203
You've got a lot of growing up to do, buddy.

445
00:21:25,204 --> 00:21:26,738
Suck my balls.

446
00:21:31,007 --> 00:21:34,201
Damn, that kid is cool, huh
