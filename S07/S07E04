00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:22,360
Okay, children, let's take our seats.

3
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:23,840
Did you take attendance, Mr. Slave?

4
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:24,720
All donesy wunsy.

5
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:25,200
Okay, let's all take out

6
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:26,440
our math homework and go 
over the problems.

7
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:28,240
Mmmath homework, Mmmath homework.

8
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:29,160
Where did I file that?

9
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:30,400
Oh, and by the way, children,

10
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:31,000
there's a walkout scheduled

11
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:32,000
today to protest the war in Iraq.

12
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:32,840
So, uh, if you're against

13
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:33,480
the war, run along outside,

14
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:34,320
and if you're for the war, uh,

15
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:35,440
stay here and we'll do math problems.

16
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:38,680
We got out of schoo-l!

17
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:40,200
No more school toda-ay!

18
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:41,000
What should we do?

19
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:41,560
Let's go see a movie!

20
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:42,120
No war! No war!

21
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:42,600
No war! No war!

22
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:43,120
No war! No war!

23
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:43,840
No war! No war!

24
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:44,880
No war!

25
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:48,520
No war, m'kay?!

26
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:49,440
No war, m'kay?!

27
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:50,960
Oh uh, here you go,boys.

28
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:51,720
These will help you protest.

29
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:52,720
It's good to see that you care

30
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:53,720
about peace, boys, m'kay?

31
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:54,440
No war, m'kay?!

32
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:55,720
Excuse me, boys.

33
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:56,560
Tom Stansel, HBC news.

34
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:57,000
Can you kids tell me

35
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:58,240
why you marched out of school today?

36
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,440
Uh... war?

37
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:01,760
Right. What about the war?

38
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:03,080
Ih ih ih-t's g-gay?

39
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:04,440
Uh huh, and what aspect of it

40
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:05,400
do you think is most gay?

41
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:06,840
Uuuh, n-no blood for oil.

42
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:07,400
Yeah.

43
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:08,360
War is not my voice.

44
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:09,520
Bush is a Naizi

45
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:11,120
Hey all you unAmerican bastards!

46
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:11,920
If you don't like America,

47
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:12,880
why don't you git out?!

48
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:14,760
Don't you call us unAmerican!

49
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:15,520
This country was

50
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:16,400
founded on the right to protest!

51
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:17,160
M'kay?

52
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:17,960
Yeah! Right!

53
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,320
If the Founding Fathers saw you 
burning your flag

54
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:20,280
an' callin' the President a Nazi,

55
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:21,240
they'd roll over in their grave!

56
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:22,320
Yeah! Right!

57
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:24,160
The Founding Fathers would agree 
with our right to protest!

58
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:25,840
Foundin' Fathers would kick all your asses!

59
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:27,520
Boys, what do you think the 
Founding Fathers would say?

60
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:29,400
...Eh the... Founding who?

61
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:33,840
Well, I hope you little Commies 
are pretty pleased with yourselves!

62
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:35,160
Going out there and protesting America,

63
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:36,400
and then saying on national television

64
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:37,680
that you don't even know who 
the Founding Fathers are!

65
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:39,200
You kids don't know squat 
about America, do you?!

66
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:41,520
Mmuh well, not really, no.

67
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:42,520
Well that's just jingles!

68
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:43,800
Because I'm assigning all you 
little flag-burners

69
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:45,040
a full report on seventeen seventy-siyix,

70
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:46,160
and the Founding Fathers!

71
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:46,840
Awwwwww!

72
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:47,400
SHUT UP!

73
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:48,360
I want you all in your study groups of four,

74
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:49,160
and if you can't give an outstanding report

75
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,160
on what the Founding Fathers 
would have to say

76
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:50,920
about all this protesting,

77
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:51,840
then it's Fs for you!

78
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:58,080
Ugh. UGHuh.

79
00:01:59,040 --> 00:01:59,560
I can't do it!

80
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:00,560
This is waaay too much material 
for a nine-year-old!

81
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:02,960
Oh no you don't, Cartman!

82
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:03,880
Every time we get put in a study group,

83
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:04,880
you sit on your ass while 
the rest of us do all the work!

84
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:06,040
But you guys are such better 
studiers than me.

85
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:06,840
I know you can pull it off.

86
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:07,920
You're gonna read this stuff 
and study like the rest of us!

87
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:10,160
Maaaa. M-maaaa.

88
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:10,960
Shut up and study!

89
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,560
Maaaa. Mah mah mh.

90
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:23,320
Hmmm, 1776.

91
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,080
When our Founding Fathers created America.

92
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:25,560
I wonder what it used to be 
like in those days?

93
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:27,480
In those days? In those days? 
In those days?

94
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:28,600
What are you doing?

95
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:29,560
I'm trying to have a flashback.

96
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:30,120
(A what?)

97
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,080
You know. If I have a flashback,

98
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,200
then I can see what 1776 was 
like first-hand!

99
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:33,120
No, you just have to study.

100
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:33,880
Nonono. I've seen this work before.

101
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:34,560
Just give me a second.

102
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:35,280
Oh okay, okay.

103
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:37,160
How about this: Say guys, 
1776 was so long ago.

104
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,360
I wonder what life would 
have been like back then?

105
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,360
Back then? Back then? Back then?

106
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:44,800
Um... Oh waitwait, I know, I know!

107
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:45,840
Heheh, you know guys,

108
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:47,040
I don't even care about 1776.

109
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:48,760
It was so long ago, that 
I don't think it has anything to do with me.

110
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:51,760
With me. With... anything 
to do with me. With me.

111
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:52,640
That isn't gonna work, dumbass!

112
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:54,040
Kids, let's keep it down for study group,

113
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,640
or else Mr. Garrison is 
going to punish me.

114
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:56,560
Just face it, Cartman.

115
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:57,200
You're gonna have to study!

116
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:59,000
Maaaaa. Meh mameh, Maaaaa!

117
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:01,680
There! All finished.

118
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:03,360
From now on, this is 
the pro-war side of town,

119
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:05,000
and that's the unpatriotic side.

120
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:07,480
How about we call this 
the rational side of town,

121
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:08,520
and that the redneck side?!

122
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:09,560
Hahahaha, yeah.

123
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:11,120
You just keep all your flag burnin'

124
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:12,360
and your hippie-rock protest 
songs on YOUR side o' the town!

125
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:13,480
Hey wait a minute,

126
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:14,760
your side of town has the post office.

127
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:15,880
Well your side has the grocery store.

128
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:17,280
Well you can come to our side 
of town to use the post office

129
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:18,640
and we can go to your side 
to use the grocery store.

130
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:20,160
Aaah, can we cross the line 
to take our kids to school?

131
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,480
W-hell, naturally you could 
cross the line for that.

132
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:22,520
Just like ...we could cross 
the line for hardware,

133
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:23,480
supplies, gas, and pharmaceutical needs.

134
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:25,040
Yup, yes sir, yeah, right, uh huh.

135
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,720
Hey everybody, this is 
never going to work.

136
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:27,360
Don't you see?

137
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:28,400
All this dividin' up the town,

138
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:29,400
it's just ridiculous.

139
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:30,400
What we really should be doing,

140
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:31,280
is just beatin' the hell out of

141
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:32,080
each other like we were.

142
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:33,280
He's right.

143
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:35,280
Boy, do I feel like a fool.

144
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:37,480
Cartman, what the hell are you doing?!

145
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:38,120
You're suppsoed to be studying!

146
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:38,840
That's what I'm doing.

147
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:39,400
I'm about to find out all

148
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:40,080
about what happened back in 1776.

149
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:40,880
How?!

150
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:42,080
All I have to do is be thinking 
about American history

151
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:43,000
when I walk through this doorway.

152
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:44,040
I'll trip the rope, causing 
the rock to fall on my head.

153
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,480
And then I will have a flashback 
to the times of our Founding Fathers!

154
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:47,120
Cartman, you are hereby declared 
a full-fledged retard!

155
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:48,320
Haha, make fun of me all you want, Kyle!

156
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:49,320
But I will have the last laugh.

157
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:51,240
Gentlemen, if you will clear 
the doorway, please?

158
00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:01,320
Cartman? Cartman??

159
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:02,800
Benjamin Franklin?

160
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:03,760
No, turdpants, it's Kyle!

161
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:06,920
Kyle! Get out of my flashback 
you goddamn Jew

162
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:08,800
Rabble! Rabble! Rabble!

163
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:09,560
Rabble! Rabble! Rabble!

164
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,040
Rabble! Rabble! Rabble!

165
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,520
Okay, people. What are we 
rabbling about now?

166
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:12,680
Mayor, our peace rally has always been

167
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:13,680
set for this Saturday!

168
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:14,520
Now, these pro-war bastards are

169
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,000
suddenly trying to say 
they get the town square.

170
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:16,920
That's bullcrap, Mayor!

171
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:18,400
Our rally to support the war 
was set up months ago!

172
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:19,800
There was no war months ago!

173
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:21,520
Hey, if you don't like America, 
then you can git out!

174
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:22,240
Look, nobody wants to hear

175
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:24,080
a bunch of twangy country music 
prowar proopaganda!

176
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:25,760
Well nobody wants to hear 
a bunch o' rock protest songs!

177
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,560
Well up yours, rednecks!

178
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,000
Rabble! Rabble! Rabble!

179
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:28,680
Rabble! Rabble! Rabble!

180
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:29,080
Rabble! Rabble! Rabble!

181
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:29,440
Quiet people!

182
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:30,680
The town square is public space.

183
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:31,560
That means if neither group 
will nicely and maturely

184
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:32,440
move the day of its rally,

185
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,960
I'll just have have to give 
the town square to both groups.

186
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
All right, that's fine!

187
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,680
Because our war support songs 
will be a thousand times better!

188
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:37,440
Oh, you think so?

189
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:38,360
Bring the shizzle!

190
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:39,240
We'll trizzle the shizzle 
all over the hizzle!

191
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:40,600
Yeah?! See you Saturday,

192
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:42,040
makizzer shanna sharilla shaz iuznatch gazizzah!

193
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:43,360
Cartman?

194
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:44,600
Cartman? You'd better be 
studying, God-damnit!

195
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,520
Ah, Stan, Kyle, Kenny, 
you're just in time.

196
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:47,040
Oh no...

197
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:47,440
Oh yes!

198
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:48,760
I am just about to flash 
back to the days of our Foundig Fathers!

199
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:49,880
Cartman, you're supposed 
to be studying!

200
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:50,760
What the hell is all this?!

201
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:51,520
I have programmed TiVo to record

202
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:52,320
over fifty hours of the 
History channel.

203
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:52,840
When TiVo is full,

204
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:53,720
both TiVo and I will be 
dropped into the water,

205
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:54,480
combining our 
electrowhatever fields

206
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:55,240
and sending me into 
a flashback of history!

207
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:56,600
Uh Cartman, I think that's 
a really bad idea.

208
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:57,800
Or a really sweet one.

209
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:58,480
Your TiVo is full.

210
00:04:58,520 --> 00:04:59,520
Whoa, here it goes!

211
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:05,640
Cartman?

212
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:06,680
Cartman??

213
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:07,600
Aww crap.

214
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:12,240
Ohhh awesome!!!

215
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:14,280
Worthy young lad, are you all right?

216
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:14,840
Yeah yeah.

217
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:15,360
Can you tell me what year it is?

218
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:15,960
This year?

219
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:16,960
Why it's 1776, it is.

220
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:17,600
Oho yes!

221
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:18,520
I did it I did it!

222
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:19,440
Would you like a ride into town?

223
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:20,120
I'm on my way to Master 
Thomas Jefferson's hosue

224
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,160
to get a very important document, I am.

225
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:22,400
Oho kick fucking ass, dude!

226
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:24,400
Never seen you around here, friend.

227
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:25,200
Might you be from up North?

228
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:26,000
No, I'm not from here at all.

229
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:26,560
I'm having a flashback.

230
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:27,280
A flashback?

231
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:27,840
Why, what is that?

232
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:28,680
Well you know, it's a...

233
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:29,640
H-ho,awesome!

234
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,600
Look at me, I'm back in time, in 1776.

235
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:32,320
With gaslight corners,

236
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:33,000
cobblestone streets,

237
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:34,080
and humble houses made of bricks.

238
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:35,240
What a special magic time,

239
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:36,600
and it's all alive for me

240
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:37,680
I'm so glad Stan and Kyle aren't here.

241
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:39,880
I hate those guys, seriously.

242
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:41,440
Seriuosly hate those guys.

243
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:43,520
Hate Stan and Kyle.

244
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:46,600
Is he going to be all right, doctor??

245
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:47,520
Your son tried to kill himself

246
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:48,760
in a ritualistic fashion 
I've never seen before.

247
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,040
His chances of surviving are very slim.

248
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:51,400
I'm so sorry.

249
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:52,520
Oh baby baby, you can't die.

250
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:52,960
Yeah.

251
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:53,760
We have a report to do, asshole!

252
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:54,680
Get up! Get up!!

253
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:55,280
Whoa. Easy, Kyle.

254
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:56,040
But it's not fair!

255
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,000
We have to do a full report 
on the Founding Fathers,

256
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:58,200
and Cartman got out of helping us again!

257
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,320
I gues we're just gonna have 
to do it with the three of us!

258
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:00,000
Come on, guys!

259
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:01,840
I know you're in a very dark 
place now, sweetie.

260
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:02,840
But you must come toward the light!

261
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:04,160
Come toward the light!

262
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:05,320
Here we are, then.

263
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,480
The current residence of 
Master Thomas Jefferson.

264
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:07,320
Super neato!

265
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:09,080
I'm afraid you'll have to wait here.

266
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,480
But, I need to talk to the 
Founding Fathers to do my report.

267
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:11,240
Sorry.

268
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:12,040
Only the official messenger boy

269
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:12,960
is allowed to talk to Mister Jefferson

270
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:13,680
Oh, okay.

271
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:14,760
I guess I understand.

272
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:17,160
I don't wanna wait for our life to be over...

273
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:21,760
I don't wanna wait for our life to be over...

274
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:24,720
Hello. I am Thomas Jefferson.

275
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:26,240
And I am the official messenger boy, I am.

276
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:26,960
Very well.

277
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,400
Take this document 
to the Continental Congress.

278
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:30,160
Wow, the Declaration 
of Independence Day.

279
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:31,280
Some favir going to war with England

280
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:32,520
and others want to avoid war at all cost.

281
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:33,400
It's a bitch, ain't it?

282
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:35,280
Perhaps this document will 
make the reasons for war obvious to all.

283
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:36,640
Good luck, young messenger!

284
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:37,560
Now make haste!

285
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:40,120
Okay, so Thomas Jefferson wrote 
the Declaration of Independence,

286
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:40,920
then the Continental Congress-

287
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:42,600
No war! No war! No war!

288
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:42,920
Oh, Jesus...

289
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,400
Uh, boys, would you mind clearing 
the living room.

290
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:45,760
We have to practice our 
big war protest song.

291
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:46,440
Dad, we have to study.

292
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:47,320
Mr. Garrison is making 
us do a presentation

293
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:48,400
on what the Founding Fathers 
would say about the war.

294
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:50,080
Hey... That's a terrific idea!

295
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:51,440
Yeah! We could have the boys 
do their presentation

296
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:52,720
as part of our peace rally on Saturday!

297
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:53,600
Oh, no, nononono.

298
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:54,320
Support our troops!

299
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:55,120
Support our troops!

300
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:56,040
Support our troops!

301
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:56,920
See? I told you they had your son.

302
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:57,480
Kenny.

303
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:58,840
What are you doing over 
here with all these unAmerican traitors?!

304
00:06:58,880 --> 00:06:59,400
(I'm doing my homework.)

305
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:00,840
The boys are going to give 
a presentation at our rally

306
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:02,040
about how the Founding Fathers would agree

307
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:03,240
with our right to protest!

308
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:04,960
Actually, we hadn't really 
come to a decision-

309
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,560
Look! My son is a patriot 
and LOVES his country!

310
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:07,400
Come on, Kenny!

311
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:07,920
(But Dad, I-)

312
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:08,560
NOW!

313
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:08,880
Yeah!

314
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:09,360
Support our troops!

315
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:09,800
Support our troops!

316
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:10,240
Support our troops!

317
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:10,480
Support our troops!

318
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:11,080
Kenny, no- ohhh!

319
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:11,320
Awww.

320
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,680
Awww, now we lost two 
in our study group!

321
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:13,080
God damnit!

322
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,360
Can you believe those 
hick sons of bitches?

323
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:15,560
Manipulating those kids 
to be on their side.

324
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:16,760
Disgraceful! Stan and Kyle,

325
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:17,760
it's up to you to show 
all those war-mongerers

326
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:18,760
that the Founding Fathers 
agree with us!

327
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,000
Yeah, that's right!

328
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:20,520
Come on, guys!

329
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:20,960
Get back to work!

330
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:21,520
Do you think kids in every town

331
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:22,560
have to deal with this crap?

332
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:26,760
Enter, young messenger.

333
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:32,120
I am John Hancock, 
President of the Congress.

334
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:32,760
Wow.

335
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:33,520
Mr. John Adams?

336
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:34,160
Aye.

337
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:35,280
Will you do the honors of reading

338
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:36,160
the document to Congress, please?

339
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:38,520
WHEN in the Course of human Events,

340
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:39,960
it becomes necessary for one People to-

341
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:41,600
-we mutually pledge 
to each other our Lives,

342
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:42,840
our Fortunes, and our sacred Honor.

343
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:46,160
P.S. - Every Thursday 
should be Free Ice Cream Day.

344
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:48,640
Excuse me,

345
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:50,080
but does this Declaration actually suggest

346
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:51,280
that we should go to go war with England?

347
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:52,480
We have no choice, Mr. Dickinson.

348
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:55,080
All right everyone,

349
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:57,200
thank you all for comin' 
out to protest the war, m'kay?

350
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:58,960
Don't kid yourselves.

351
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,800
These people have come 
out to support our troops, right?!

352
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:03,080
And now, Randy Marsh is gonna sing

353
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,600
a protest song he wrote about the war.

354
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:05,720
Oh no you don't!

355
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:06,840
We're doing our pro-war song first!

356
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:07,600
Yeah!

357
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:08,360
The last thing these people want

358
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:09,520
is a bleedin'-heart rock protest song!

359
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:10,640
People, I told you,

360
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:11,400
you have to share the stage.

361
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,640
Nobody wants to here another 
pro-war country song!

362
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:14,960
Well excuse me if...

363
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,040
I'm a little bit country.

364
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:19,040
Well I'm a little bit rock-n-roll!

365
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:20,760
I'm a little for supportin' our troops.

366
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:23,160
And I'm a little for bringin' them home.

367
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:24,520
I believe freedom isn't free.

368
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:25,680
No, but war shouldn't be our goal.

369
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:27,400
We must defend our country.

370
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:28,960
If it means war, then we say NO!

371
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,040
Yeehaw!

372
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:33,160
Did you forget them towers in New York?

373
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,440
Did you forget how it made you feel

374
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:37,160
To see them towers come down?

375
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,360
Were you like me?

376
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:40,280
Did you think it weren't real?

377
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,280
I like to rock,

378
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:43,880
but I don't wanna rock Iraq!

379
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:45,400
The only kind of rockin' America

380
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,760
should do is the kind that 
we can all dance to, yeah!

381
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:51,240
We got GPS, ICBMs, and good 
old-fashioned lead.

382
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:53,000
We're gonna show Saddam 
what America means;

383
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:54,760
that son of a bitch will be dead.

384
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,760
Why are we fightin' this war?

385
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,480
There's a man in the office 
we didn't vote for.

386
00:08:58,520 --> 00:08:59,840
They didn't give me a choice.

387
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:01,360
War is not my voice!

388
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:02,280
Yeaaaaahhhh!

389
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:05,600
We must go to war!

390
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:06,480
But what about the violence?!

391
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:07,160
The lives lost?!

392
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:07,920
If we found a country,

393
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:09,280
it should be founded on 
peace and diplomacy.

394
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:10,680
England will only understand one thing:

395
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:11,400
Force.

396
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:12,640
I must state again for the record that

397
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:13,160
South Carolina, North Carolina,

398
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,080
Pennsylvania, Maryland,

399
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:15,360
and Georgia are against war!

400
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:16,440
Yeah, because you don't 
care about the fate

401
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:17,480
of the Colonies like we do!

402
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:18,560
You're all unpatriotic!

403
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:19,400
And if you don't like the Colonies,

404
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:20,520
then you can git out!

405
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:21,480
Don't you call us unpatriotic!

406
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:22,360
We're protesting this war

407
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:23,160
because we care so deeply

408
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,040
for the fate of our Colonies!

409
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:24,840
You are all unpatriotic

410
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:25,560
for leading the Colonies into a war

411
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:26,320
that half of them don't want!

412
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:28,240
Whoa, how very very relevant.

413
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,680
Tom, I'm standing in the town square

414
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:32,440
where the war rally has been going on

415
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:33,600
for an incredible eighty-seven hours.

416
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:34,720
The crowd still appears to be split

417
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:35,600
right down the middle

418
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:36,360
- half of them support country music,

419
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:37,120
and the other half rock-n-roll.

420
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:37,920
Let's listen in.

421
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:38,760
And now we'd like to bring out

422
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:39,840
a couple of very special 
South Park students

423
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:40,640
who did a report

424
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:41,320
on what the Founding Fathers

425
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:42,560
would have to say about the war.

426
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:45,640
Booooo!!

427
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:46,120
For you people

428
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:47,040
who still think war is the answer,

429
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:48,280
perhaps you can listen to the voices ...

430
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:50,120
of the children.

431
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,240
Uh, we didn't do it.

432
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:54,160
What?

433
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:55,240
We didn't do our homework.

434
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:55,800
Boys!

435
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:56,760
You were supposed to come out here

436
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:57,880
and tell everyone 
about the Founding Fathers!

437
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:58,960
Well, first we lost one study partner

438
00:09:59,000 --> 00:09:59,720
when Cartman put himself in the hospital,

439
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:00,320
and then they took Kenny away,

440
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:01,200
and then Kyle forgot to set his clock

441
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:01,680
ahead for Dalight Saving,

442
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:02,640
so we couldn't find anything 
in the history books

443
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:03,280
about Iraq and then-

444
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:03,960
That's because the Founding Fathers

445
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:04,960
would have supported the war!

446
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,080
The Founding Fathers would 
have protested like us!

447
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:07,120
Support!

448
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:07,800
Protest!

449
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:08,520
Country!

450
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:09,440
Rock-n-roll!

451
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:16,240
Rabble Rabble Rabble

452
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:16,560
Rabble Rabble Rabble

453
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:16,960
Rabble Rabble Rabble

454
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:17,360
Rabble Rabble Rabble!

455
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:19,520
We cannot found a country based on war!

456
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:21,120
We cannot found a country 
that is afraid to fight!

457
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:21,680
Rabble!

458
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:22,360
Rabble Rabble Rabble

459
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:22,760
Rabble Rabble Rabble

460
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:23,200
Rabble!

461
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:24,840
Oh my, it's Benjamin Franklin.

462
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:25,160
It's Benjamin Franklin.

463
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,000
It's Benjamin Franklin.

464
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:27,080
Oh, it's Benjamin Franklin.

465
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:27,480
It's Benjamin Franklin.

466
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:27,960
It's Benjamin Franklin.

467
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,520
Mr. Franklin,

468
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:30,200
where do you stand on the war issue?

469
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:32,760
I believe that if we are to 
form a new country,

470
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,560
we cannot be a country 
that appears war-hungry

471
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:35,720
and violent to the rest of the world.

472
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,600
However, we also cannot be a country

473
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:38,720
that appears weak and unwilling to fight

474
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:39,720
to the rest of the world.

475
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:41,560
So, what if we form a country

476
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,120
that appears to want both?

477
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:45,520
Yes. Yes of course.

478
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:46,560
We go to war,

479
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,160
and protest going to war 
at the same time.

480
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:49,080
Right.

481
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:49,800
If the people of our new country

482
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:50,720
are allowed to do whatever they wish,

483
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:51,440
then some will support the war

484
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:52,520
and some will protest it.

485
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:53,720
And that means that as a nation,

486
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:54,960
we could go to war with 
whomever we wished,

487
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:55,920
but at the same time,

488
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:56,760
act like we didn't want to.

489
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,320
If we allow the people to protest

490
00:10:58,360 --> 00:10:59,360
what the government does,

491
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:00,520
then the country 
will be forever blameless.

492
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:02,280
It's like having your cake,

493
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:03,520
and eating it, too.

494
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:04,240
Think of it:

495
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:05,560
an entire nation founded 
on saying one thing

496
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:06,440
and doing another.

497
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:07,560
And we will call that country

498
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,040
the United States of America.

499
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:11,120
Wow, I get it now!

500
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:12,040
I get it!

501
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:12,960
Whoa, here it goes.

502
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:13,840
I wish I could go back to my time.

503
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:14,920
To my time, to, to my time.

504
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:16,800
Wow!

505
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:25,560
Everyone, stop!

506
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:26,320
Please!

507
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:27,720
The-the child!

508
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:28,760
The child, from the hospital.

509
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:29,600
If you all don't mind,

510
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:30,600
I would like to do my report now.

511
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:32,080
I know what the founding 
fathers would say.

512
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:33,080
He does?

513
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:33,520
He does?

514
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:34,400
learned somethin' today.

515
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:35,880
This country was founded

516
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:36,560
by some of the smartest 
thinkers the world has ever seen.

517
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:37,360
And they knew one thing:

518
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:38,320
that a truely great country

519
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:39,320
can go to war, and at the same time,

520
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:40,120
act like it doesn't want to.

521
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:41,280
You people who are for the war,

522
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:42,120
you need the protesters.

523
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:42,800
Because they make the country look

524
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:43,920
like it's made of sane, 
caring individuals.

525
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:44,800
And you people who are anti-war,

526
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:45,720
you need these flag-wavers,

527
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:46,600
because, if our whole 
country was made up

528
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:47,480
of nothing but soft pussy protesters,

529
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:48,680
we'd get taken down in a second.

530
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:49,600
That's why the founding fathers decided

531
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:50,400
we should have both.

532
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:52,040
It's called "having your 
cake and eating it too."

533
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:53,080
He's right.

534
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:54,080
The strength of this 
country is the ability

535
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:55,240
to do one thing and say another.

536
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:56,000
Yeah, but...

537
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:57,040
if it weren't for 
all you guys protesting,

538
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:57,840
why everyone around the world

539
00:11:57,880 --> 00:11:58,800
would hate the American people

540
00:11:58,840 --> 00:11:59,960
instead of just the President.

541
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,160
And if it weren't for you 
people flexing your arms,

542
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,240
America could easily get 
taken over by terrorists or

543
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:03,400
... or China.

544
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:04,640
I guess we... owe you an apology.

545
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:05,880
Eh-ah, I guess we owe you one.

546
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:07,760
Awww.

547
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:10,120
Cartman?

548
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:11,000
Cartman saved the day?

549
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:11,560
Can't be

550
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:12,560
The Founding Fathers 
want you all to know

551
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:13,360
that we can disagree all we want,

552
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:14,640
as long as we agree 
that America kicks ass.

553
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:16,680
Hey I'm a little bit country

554
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:18,480
And I'm a little bit rock-n-roll-eh

555
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:20,040
I'll be the muscle of America

556
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:21,600
And me, I'll be the caring soul.

557
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:23,360
When you put us together

558
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:24,480
you get a nation with one goal

559
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:25,960
To thrive and prosper,

560
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,200
with a little country and rock and roll.

561
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:28,360
Come on up here, everybody!

562
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:31,280
We're a little bit country,

563
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:32,640
and we're a little bit rock-n-roll

564
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:34,000
We can be a nation that believe in war,

565
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:35,720
And still tells the world that we don't.

566
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:37,040
Let the flag for hyprocisy

567
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:38,120
fly high from every pole

568
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:39,680
We're a little bit country,

569
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:40,960
and we're a little bit rock-n-roll

570
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:42,400
Well, goodnight everybody.

571
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:43,080
It sure has been great

572
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:44,000
bringing you a hundred episodes.

573
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:44,880
We want to thank our guests,

574
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:46,240
the pro-war people.

575
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:47,840
And the anti-war people.

576
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:48,680
What the hell are they doing now?

577
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:49,560
Ah I don't know.

578
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:50,360
For the war, against,

579
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:51,200
the war, WHO CARES??

580
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:53,280
One hundred episodes!

581
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:55,320
I hate this town.

582
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:56,480
Ah I really really do.

583
00:12:56,520 --> 00:13:00,600
