1
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,400
Chanukah, Chanukah, sivivon, sov, sov

2
00:00:39,807 --> 00:00:40,653
I gotta go tinkle.

3
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:41,868
No Ike! Shh!

4
00:00:42,347 --> 00:00:43,930
Sov, sov, sov! Sov, sov, sov! Ma nayim vi-tov.

5
00:00:44,884 --> 00:00:47,377
We thank God for our blessings this Chanukah.

6
00:00:47,378 --> 00:00:52,602
Our little family is so loving, and perfect, and nothing will ever tear us apart.

7
00:00:54,377 --> 00:00:55,732
I'll get it.

8
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:59,113
Gerald Broflovski?

9
00:00:59,114 --> 00:00:59,926
Yes?

10
00:00:59,961 --> 00:01:03,737
My name is Harry Gints and this is my wife Elise. We're from Canada.

11
00:01:04,264 --> 00:01:06,292
Yes, I can tell.

12
00:01:06,327 --> 00:01:11,679
My wife and I had a child a few years back, and, we weren't ready to have a child, so we put him up for adoption.

13
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,253
We were told that you might be the-

14
00:01:13,254 --> 00:01:17,819
Peter!  Oh God, Harry! It's our son! Peter, it's Mommy.

15
00:01:18,499 --> 00:01:20,116
Gerald, what the hell is going on?

16
00:01:20,151 --> 00:01:21,504
I I'm not sure.

17
00:01:22,445 --> 00:01:25,915
It was a tough time for us. It was a tough time for all of Canada.

18
00:01:25,916 --> 00:01:28,677
The whole country was devastated by the cola wars.

19
00:01:28,678 --> 00:01:30,904
It just seemed we couldn't take care of a baby.

20
00:01:31,082 --> 00:01:33,762
So we put him up for adoption. But as the years passed, I,

21
00:01:33,763 --> 00:01:37,501
I just felt an emptiness in my heart. Oh it's so good to see him.

22
00:01:37,693 --> 00:01:41,724
Well we wish you all the best, Mr. and Mrs. Gints, but to be honest,

23
00:01:41,725 --> 00:01:45,593
I think it would be best for Ike if you didn't come around again.

24
00:01:45,730 --> 00:01:49,197
I don't think you understand. We didn't come to visit Peter,

25
00:01:49,198 --> 00:01:50,198
...we came to take him back.

26
00:01:51,197 --> 00:01:51,947
What?

27
00:01:51,982 --> 00:01:54,018
We want to take Peter home, to Canada.

28
00:01:54,304 --> 00:01:55,501
Are you crazy?!

29
00:01:55,536 --> 00:01:58,847
Look, you gave Ike up. You can't just change your mind.

30
00:01:58,882 --> 00:02:01,445
Changing your mind is a Canadian custom that we hold quite dear.

31
00:02:01,446 --> 00:02:07,188
And besides, the new Canadian Prime Minister has issued a decree that all adopted Canadians must be returned home.

32
00:02:07,396 --> 00:02:09,570
The new Canadian Prime Minister?

33
00:02:09,605 --> 00:02:11,270
Look, Ike is our son now!

34
00:02:11,305 --> 00:02:15,159
He doesn't belong here. He belongs in Canada with his own kind.

35
00:02:15,194 --> 00:02:16,828
I think you'd better leave.

36
00:02:16,863 --> 00:02:18,669
Please, don't make things any harder for Peter.

37
00:02:18,704 --> 00:02:24,814
Harder for Peter?! Now you two just blow in here and say you're gonna haul him back to Canada, and we're being hard on Peter?!

38
00:02:24,849 --> 00:02:27,130
We're prepared to go to court! We had hoped it wouldn't come to that!

39
00:02:27,165 --> 00:02:28,995
Well you bet your ass it'll come to that!

40
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:33,363
I'm sorry to say that my hands are tied. 

41
00:02:33,364 --> 00:02:37,195
The new Prime Minister of Canada has authority this court cannot override.

42
00:02:37,196 --> 00:02:41,434
By Canadian law I must award custody of the child to his birth parents.

43
00:02:41,455 --> 00:02:42,381
Yes!

44
00:02:42,416 --> 00:02:43,271
Yes!

45
00:02:43,306 --> 00:02:44,016
No!

46
00:02:44,051 --> 00:02:45,919
Ike's not my little brother anymore?

47
00:02:46,248 --> 00:02:47,733
Gerald, do something!

48
00:02:47,768 --> 00:02:48,955
There's nothing I can do.

49
00:02:52,568 --> 00:02:56,636
Good-bye, Ike. You...  be a good bye, huh? 

50
00:02:56,637 --> 00:02:59,298
You... remember all the things we taught you.

51
00:03:01,781 --> 00:03:04,983
Ike, you'll always be my little brother, okay?

52
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:06,396
Come on, Peter, we should get going.

53
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:07,746
No!

54
00:03:08,621 --> 00:03:10,528
Peter, you must come with Mommy and Daddy.

55
00:03:10,563 --> 00:03:12,151
No no no no no!

56
00:03:13,009 --> 00:03:14,289
I have some chocolate.

57
00:03:14,686 --> 00:03:15,951
Chocolate!

58
00:03:17,785 --> 00:03:19,530
We're going to take good care of him.

59
00:03:19,565 --> 00:03:20,684
You'd better! 

60
00:03:32,264 --> 00:03:35,165
Dad, can't we talk to this new Canadian Prime Minister?

61
00:03:35,166 --> 00:03:36,892
if he knew the situation, he might e-

62
00:03:36,893 --> 00:03:42,406
Oh! Kyle, appealing to the Prime Minister of Canada would take... time and money we don't have.

63
00:03:47,298 --> 00:03:51,252
Dude, look at that. Sprinkle Time Make Your Own Marshmallow Factory.

64
00:03:51,744 --> 00:03:52,253
I'm definitely asking for that for Christmas.

65
00:03:53,935 --> 00:03:57,576
Dude, I'm gonna tell my parents to get me that John Elway doll with the karate-chop action.

66
00:03:58,873 --> 00:04:00,544
Guys. Guys, I need your help.

67
00:04:00,579 --> 00:04:01,402
Sure dude.

68
00:04:01,437 --> 00:04:04,844
It's been a week since Ike's been gone, and every day my parents seem worse.

69
00:04:04,845 --> 00:04:09,164
I have to try to go to Canada and speak with the new Canadian Prime Minister, but I can't do it alone.

70
00:04:09,324 --> 00:04:11,405
We can't go to Canada, dumbass! It's Christmas!

71
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:14,018
Yeah, dude. What if we miss out on some great Christmas adventure?

72
00:04:14,053 --> 00:04:17,508
Please, you guys, you don't understand. My family is devastated.

73
00:04:17,509 --> 00:04:20,624
My mom just walks around the house like a zombie, and my dad can't stop crying.

74
00:04:20,701 --> 00:04:22,858
Well, I didn't wanna say anything, Kyle,

75
00:04:22,859 --> 00:04:23,859
...but I think this is what your family gets for being Jewish at Christmastime.

76
00:04:26,506 --> 00:04:27,258
Dude, Cartman.

77
00:04:27,293 --> 00:04:30,358
I'm just saying, maybe Jesus is having a little revenge, that's all.

78
00:04:30,393 --> 00:04:34,056
I found the number for a really cheap airline to Canada. If we go as soon as possible, then-

79
00:04:34,091 --> 00:04:35,992
Dude, we just can't up and go to Canada. 

80
00:04:35,993 --> 00:04:37,783
Look, they're about to light the Christmas tree. 

81
00:04:37,784 --> 00:04:39,665
Maybe you can get your brother back some other way.

82
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:46,989
Kyle, I just want you to know, if it were any other time of the year,

83
00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:48,524
...I still wouldn't help you.

84
00:04:51,907 --> 00:04:57,433
Three! Two! One!  Yaaaaay!

85
00:04:57,468 --> 00:05:01,315
As we celebrate this glorious time, we can't forget those families who are suffering.

86
00:05:01,316 --> 00:05:06,067
As many of you know, the Broflovski family has recently had their child torn away from them. 

87
00:05:06,068 --> 00:05:09,166
As a community, we must do all we can to ease their pain.

88
00:05:09,167 --> 00:05:11,784
Are there any suggestions how we might help?

89
00:05:13,431 --> 00:05:15,931
How about, we get rid of all the Mexicans?

90
00:05:18,281 --> 00:05:21,275
Mr. Garrison, every Christmas you suggest we get rid of all the Mexicans,

91
00:05:21,276 --> 00:05:23,327
...and every Christmas we tell you "NO!"

92
00:05:23,510 --> 00:05:24,301
Rats!

93
00:05:24,861 --> 00:05:28,688
The Broflovskis need money to appeal that case to the new Canadian Prime Minister.

94
00:05:28,689 --> 00:05:33,960
What if this Christmas, instead of buyin' presents, we all use that money to give to the Broflovskis?

95
00:05:34,087 --> 00:05:38,290
HA! Yeah, right! Like our parents aren't gonna buy us presents for Christmas!

96
00:05:38,325 --> 00:05:40,217
That's a great idea, Chef.

97
00:05:40,252 --> 00:05:40,904
What?

98
00:05:40,939 --> 00:05:42,798
Yeah. Who needs more stuff, anyway?

99
00:05:42,799 --> 00:05:43,799
This Christmas we can do somethin' that really matters!

100
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,051
Dad, don't get carried away.

101
00:05:47,086 --> 00:05:50,833
Then it's settled: This year we'll give all our Christmas money to the Broflovskis,

102
00:05:50,834 --> 00:05:53,821
...in hopes that they may someday have their child returned to them.

103
00:05:55,906 --> 00:05:57,497
No! No, this can't be happening!

104
00:06:04,594 --> 00:06:07,607
You fucking asshole!! This is all your fault!!

105
00:06:07,649 --> 00:06:08,348
What?

106
00:06:08,383 --> 00:06:12,560
Everyone's gonna be charitable and give money to your family instead of buying Christmas presents!!  

107
00:06:12,561 --> 00:06:13,561
You fucking Jews ruined Christmas again!!

108
00:06:16,087 --> 00:06:16,909
Whoa whoa, Cartman.

109
00:06:16,944 --> 00:06:21,242
It wasn't enough for you people to kill Jesus, now you have to kill Christmas too, huh?!

110
00:06:21,277 --> 00:06:22,245
Cartman, calm down!

111
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:23,229
Is that true?

112
00:06:23,264 --> 00:06:24,936
It's true, dude. Christmas is ruined.

113
00:06:25,763 --> 00:06:26,781
This is it, Kyle. 

114
00:06:26,782 --> 00:06:29,308
You and me. We're throwin' down. Right now.

115
00:06:29,343 --> 00:06:31,602
I'm sorry you guys, but there is something we can do.

116
00:06:31,603 --> 00:06:34,211
We can go to Canada and see the Prime Minister like I said.

117
00:06:34,212 --> 00:06:38,292
If we can change his mind before Christmas, then your parents won't have to give my family money.

118
00:06:38,369 --> 00:06:40,895
You really think if we go to Canada we might still get Christmas presents?

119
00:06:40,930 --> 00:06:43,647
It's worth a shot. Come on, you guys, we can do this.

120
00:06:44,144 --> 00:06:47,346
Oh all right, but we'd better not miss out on great Christmas adventures.

121
00:06:47,381 --> 00:06:48,923
We'll get back in time for a Christmas adventure.

122
00:06:49,317 --> 00:06:53,569
Fine. But if it doesn't work, you and me are gonna have it out, Kyle. Once and for all.

123
00:06:58,285 --> 00:07:03,892
No business... Christmastime come anda nobody wanna eata Chinese food.

124
00:07:05,598 --> 00:07:08,008
Looks like I might as well close.

125
00:07:09,716 --> 00:07:12,528
Oh boy! Some business! Finally!

126
00:07:12,529 --> 00:07:16,166
Herro? Shitty Wok, take ur orda prease!

127
00:07:16,201 --> 00:07:19,141
Uh, I must have the wrong number.

128
00:07:19,176 --> 00:07:21,148
Oh, oh yes, just a moment prease.

129
00:07:23,081 --> 00:07:26,066
Herro, Shitty Airrines. Can I help you take ur orda prease?

130
00:07:26,221 --> 00:07:28,879
Uh, we need to go to Canada. As soon as possible.

131
00:07:28,914 --> 00:07:31,760
Oooh, Canada. Okay, that's uh pretty far.

132
00:07:31,761 --> 00:07:35,207
Gonna cost ya a rot of money... hmlet's she. How many people?

133
00:07:35,372 --> 00:07:36,169
Four.

134
00:07:36,204 --> 00:07:42,613
Okay. Four people, Canada, cost a rot of money, that uh gonna be about ah six thousand five hundred daura.

135
00:07:43,336 --> 00:07:44,722
How about fifty daura?

136
00:07:45,756 --> 00:07:50,565
Fifty daura?! You flighn to Canada cost at reast three thousand daura!

137
00:07:51,158 --> 00:07:52,335
Fifty-five daura.

138
00:07:52,856 --> 00:07:55,816
Hey! Stop wasting my time wa fifty-five daura! 

139
00:07:55,817 --> 00:07:59,335
No way I take my plane to Canada for less than a thousand daura!

140
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:01,959
Okay. Sixty daura.

141
00:08:01,994 --> 00:08:03,567
Sixty-two daura.

142
00:08:03,602 --> 00:08:04,503
Okay.

143
00:08:04,538 --> 00:08:08,849
Okay. Meet me Park County Airfield, yellow Cessna, tail number 432G.

144
00:08:08,850 --> 00:08:09,882
Got it.

145
00:08:09,917 --> 00:08:13,196
Hehehehe, never try to barter with a Chinese man.

146
00:08:15,834 --> 00:08:18,532
We have exactly fifty-two hours before Christmas.

147
00:08:18,533 --> 00:08:22,953
That means we have to be back in twenty-eight hours to still give our patents twenty-four hours to buy us presents.

148
00:08:22,954 --> 00:08:25,227
Synchronize watches on my mark.
Mark!

149
00:08:26,241 --> 00:08:28,300
Herro, welcome Shitty Airrine.

150
00:08:29,190 --> 00:08:31,866
Oh no, no no nono, I am NOT flying in that thing!

151
00:08:31,901 --> 00:08:32,494
(Me neither!)

152
00:08:32,495 --> 00:08:33,553
Why not?

153
00:08:33,588 --> 00:08:34,551
('Cause, dude, I'll fuckin' die!)

154
00:08:34,586 --> 00:08:36,557
You're not gonna die, Kenny. Don't be stupid.

155
00:08:36,947 --> 00:08:39,604
You guys go get Ike. Kenny and I will stay here and watch the fort.

156
00:08:39,897 --> 00:08:42,173
No, you're both coming. Do you care about Christmas or not?

157
00:08:42,208 --> 00:08:45,163
Of course I care about Christmas- Doh, Christ on a stick!

158
00:08:47,925 --> 00:08:50,088
Aw dude, it smells like Kung Pao chicken in here!

159
00:08:50,123 --> 00:08:53,690
Okay, welcome aboard Shitty Airrines. This is your captain speaking.

160
00:08:53,691 --> 00:08:57,358
Rooking about a two hour fright. I'll be turning on the seatbelt sign now.

161
00:08:57,359 --> 00:09:00,240
If your seats have seatbelts, this is the time you will fasten them.

162
00:09:00,241 --> 00:09:03,493
Please sit back, relax, and enjoy your Shitty fright.

163
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,048
All right! We're going to Canada!

164
00:09:13,083 --> 00:09:14,544
Sweet.

165
00:09:29,701 --> 00:09:31,491
Hey, turn off the right. ...Wha- oh!

166
00:09:33,969 --> 00:09:34,833
What's going on??

167
00:09:35,521 --> 00:09:38,327
Herro from the cockpit, this is your captain speaking.

168
00:09:38,328 --> 00:09:40,804
As you can see, it appears that we are goin' down.

169
00:09:40,805 --> 00:09:45,510
Now would be a good time to refrect on your rife, and pray to whatever deity you bereive in.

170
00:09:45,511 --> 00:09:49,048
Thank you for flying Shitty Airlines. We know you have a choice in airlines,

171
00:09:49,049 --> 00:09:50,705
...and it looks like you made the wrong one.

172
00:09:51,597 --> 00:09:53,442
Hey, where the hell are you going??

173
00:09:54,913 --> 00:09:55,836
Do something, Kyle!

174
00:09:55,871 --> 00:09:56,781
I'm trying!

175
00:09:57,299 --> 00:09:58,571
Look out!

176
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:14,103
You guys, I don't think we're in America anymore.

177
00:10:18,102 --> 00:10:21,152
Eh-xcuse me?  Uh, is this an invasion?

178
00:10:21,838 --> 00:10:22,751
No.

179
00:10:22,786 --> 00:10:26,461
Oh thank heavens! It's okay. Everyone, it's not an invasion!

180
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:33,390
Hey! We're in Canada!

181
00:10:33,391 --> 00:10:37,020
Well of course you are! And Canada Friends welcomes you!

182
00:10:38,447 --> 00:10:41,307
<i>Welcome, friend, to Canada! Canada Friends loves you!</i>

183
00:10:41,342 --> 00:10:44,491
<i>We're just like any other country without the big tattoo!</i>

184
00:10:44,526 --> 00:10:47,882
<i>We greet thee with pleasure, but one question, if we may?</i>

185
00:10:47,917 --> 00:10:50,873
<i>What brings you folks to Canada? Why are you here today?</i>

186
00:10:52,849 --> 00:10:55,671
Uh. My adopted brother got taken back here to Canada?

187
00:10:55,965 --> 00:10:59,591
So, we want to talk to the new Canadian Prime Minister about getting him back?

188
00:10:59,711 --> 00:11:02,930
<i>His brother is our quest. The question is, is what?</i>

189
00:11:02,931 --> 00:11:06,301
<i>You must talk to the new Prime Minister if you think his brother's home's back there.</i>

190
00:11:06,305 --> 00:11:07,853
Oh Jesus Christ.

191
00:11:08,242 --> 00:11:09,958
Hey! What the hell is going on?!

192
00:11:09,993 --> 00:11:11,533
It's Scott!

193
00:11:15,001 --> 00:11:17,098
Who damaged our beloved Canadian land?!

194
00:11:17,133 --> 00:11:18,003
Who's that?

195
00:11:18,038 --> 00:11:19,288
That's Scott! He's a dick!

196
00:11:20,686 --> 00:11:23,258
A-ha! Americans! I should've known!

197
00:11:23,259 --> 00:11:25,804
You think you're the police of the world! You think you own Canada!

198
00:11:25,805 --> 00:11:28,139
Well, you aren't welcome here! Get out now!

199
00:11:28,302 --> 00:11:30,502
Oh no you don't, Scott! Leave these boys alone!

200
00:11:30,956 --> 00:11:34,261
This isn't over, you American scum! I swear to God: you'll rue this day!!

201
00:11:36,524 --> 00:11:37,607
God, what a dick!

202
00:11:38,204 --> 00:11:40,161
Look, we don't have a lot of time here, okay?

203
00:11:40,162 --> 00:11:41,162
Can you just tell us where the new Prime Minister is?

204
00:11:42,365 --> 00:11:45,596
The new Prime Minister doesn't live in this part of Canada. He's in Ottawa.

205
00:11:47,946 --> 00:11:49,062
So how do we get to Ottawa?

206
00:11:49,097 --> 00:11:51,661
Oh that's easy. You just have to follow the road.

207
00:11:51,696 --> 00:11:52,875
Which road?!

208
00:11:52,910 --> 00:11:55,361
This is Canada. We only have one road.

209
00:11:55,987 --> 00:11:57,442
<i>Follow the only road.</i>

210
00:11:57,477 --> 00:11:59,277
<i>Follow the only road.</i>

211
00:11:59,312 --> 00:12:02,842
<i>To go anywhere in Canada, you just follow the only road.</i>

212
00:12:02,877 --> 00:12:04,771
<i>There's only one road in Canada.</i>

213
00:12:04,772 --> 00:12:06,567
<i>We call it the Road, the only road.</i>

214
00:12:06,602 --> 00:12:09,742
<i>Hip-hip, hooray, let's hear it for our Road.</i>

215
00:12:09,777 --> 00:12:12,042
<i>And it's paved and wide and up to code.</i>

216
00:12:12,913 --> 00:12:14,288
All right dude, let's get the hell out of here!

217
00:12:14,323 --> 00:12:14,984
Word!

218
00:12:15,019 --> 00:12:16,268
<i>You're off to see the Prime Minister,</i>

219
00:12:16,269 --> 00:12:18,178
<i>the Prime Minister of Canada!</i>

220
00:12:18,213 --> 00:12:21,015
Good-bye, friends! Good luck with the new Prime Minister!

221
00:12:21,016 --> 00:12:23,556
And remember to watch out for Scott! He's a dick!

222
00:12:23,633 --> 00:12:25,558
Good-bye, good-bye, see ya, good luck.

223
00:12:28,995 --> 00:12:30,257
Twenty hours until Christmas.

224
00:12:30,258 --> 00:12:32,810
Our parents still have time to buy us presents IF we hurry.

225
00:12:33,558 --> 00:12:35,069
Ahoy there, travelers.

226
00:12:35,417 --> 00:12:36,333
Who are you?

227
00:12:36,368 --> 00:12:39,491
I am Rick, the proud Canadian Mountie.

228
00:12:42,425 --> 00:12:44,158
I thought mounties were supposed to ride horses.

229
00:12:45,154 --> 00:12:46,936
Yes. Yes, we are.

230
00:12:46,937 --> 00:12:49,793
But our funding has been cut and now we're forced to ride...

231
00:12:51,773 --> 00:12:53,927
But if you don't mind, we're in a rush to see the new Prime Minister.

232
00:12:53,962 --> 00:12:55,741
You're going to see the new Prime Minister.

233
00:12:55,742 --> 00:12:57,983
Oh, I would so like to meet him myself. 

234
00:12:57,984 --> 00:13:01,640
It's his strange new laws that took our horses away. Perhaps I will go with you.

235
00:13:01,758 --> 00:13:03,467
That's okay, we'd rather just go by ourselves.

236
00:13:03,502 --> 00:13:08,111
Follow me this way! We're going to see the Prime Minister, the Prime Minister of Canada!

237
00:13:08,702 --> 00:13:11,329
Power-hungry Americans! I'll fix you!

238
00:13:15,019 --> 00:13:17,919
Oh Jesus, eighteen hours. We're running out of time!

239
00:13:17,954 --> 00:13:21,432
All right boys, prepare yourselves. We're about to enter... French Canada.

240
00:13:21,467 --> 00:13:22,228
French Canada?

241
00:13:22,263 --> 00:13:25,498
<i>There'z no Canada like French Canada,</i>

242
00:13:25,499 --> 00:13:27,624
<i>...it'z za bezt Canada in ze land.</i>

243
00:13:27,659 --> 00:13:30,339
<i>Ze ozer Canada is hardly Canada.</i>

244
00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:31,340
<i>If you lived here for a day, you'd understand.</i>

245
00:13:33,882 --> 00:13:36,253
Welcome to French Canada.

246
00:13:36,288 --> 00:13:38,278
We have everyzing your heart could desire.

247
00:13:38,279 --> 00:13:41,553
Trapezes. Trampolines. And lots and lots of cheese.

248
00:13:41,787 --> 00:13:43,189
Would you like a moustache?

249
00:13:43,757 --> 00:13:46,622
Just stay calm, boys. French Canadians are a little... odd.

250
00:13:46,657 --> 00:13:49,253
Ah, we're just passing through to see the new Prime Minister.

251
00:13:49,288 --> 00:13:52,136
Well first you must answer that phone.

252
00:13:52,137 --> 00:13:53,720
Ring-ring. Ring-ring.

253
00:13:54,736 --> 00:13:56,106
We don't have time for this.

254
00:13:56,141 --> 00:13:59,656
You cannot pass through French Canada unless you take zat phone call!

255
00:13:59,657 --> 00:14:01,356
Ring-ring. Ring-ring.

256
00:14:03,277 --> 00:14:04,320
Hello?

257
00:14:04,355 --> 00:14:08,654
Allo. If you are going to see za new Prime Minister, then I want to go with you. 

258
00:14:08,655 --> 00:14:12,421
He has passed a new law forbidding us French Canadians to drink wine.

259
00:14:12,457 --> 00:14:15,317
How can ze French not drink wine?? Travestie!

260
00:14:15,352 --> 00:14:16,895
Okay, you can come with us.

261
00:14:17,419 --> 00:14:19,386
Very good! Let us make haste!

262
00:14:20,522 --> 00:14:22,964
<i>There'z no Canada like French Canada,</i>

263
00:14:22,965 --> 00:14:24,931
<i>...it'z za bezt Canada in ze land.</i>

264
00:14:25,409 --> 00:14:26,678
<i>And ze ozer Canada.</i>

265
00:14:26,713 --> 00:14:27,739
<i>Is a bullshit Canada</i>

266
00:14:27,774 --> 00:14:29,649
<i>If you lived here for a day, you'd understand.</i>

267
00:14:30,875 --> 00:14:32,639
<i>I think you'd understand. </i>

268
00:14:33,548 --> 00:14:35,134
<i>...You understand.</i>

269
00:14:41,126 --> 00:14:44,050
Oh my! This certainly is a desolate place!

270
00:14:44,085 --> 00:14:46,161
It reminds me of death and fear.

271
00:14:46,504 --> 00:14:49,311
How much further to Ottawa! Christmas is only twelve hours away.

272
00:14:49,346 --> 00:14:51,059
We must be very close now.

273
00:14:51,094 --> 00:14:52,829
Ey! What are you doing?!

274
00:14:53,949 --> 00:14:55,359
Oh no. It's Scott.

275
00:14:55,394 --> 00:14:57,277
What are you two doing helping these Americans?!

276
00:14:57,278 --> 00:15:00,603
Don't you know America thinks it owns Canada along with the rest of the world?!

277
00:15:00,652 --> 00:15:02,003
You're a dick, Scott!

278
00:15:02,038 --> 00:15:05,309
You're a dick! And by helping Americans, you're just as smelly as they are!

279
00:15:05,310 --> 00:15:06,921
Now I'm going to get you!

280
00:15:06,978 --> 00:15:08,027
Not a-hire, Scott!

281
00:15:08,062 --> 00:15:09,108
Who the hell are you?!

282
00:15:09,143 --> 00:15:10,632
I'm Steve the Newfoudlander.

283
00:15:10,633 --> 00:15:12,340
And you'er on Newfoundland property now!

284
00:15:12,341 --> 00:15:14,143
Get off before I have you arrested!

285
00:15:14,178 --> 00:15:18,507
Ugh! This isn't over! Not by a long shot! I'll fix you. I'll fix all of you!!

286
00:15:19,695 --> 00:15:22,405
Woo, that was a close call. Thank you, kind Newfie!

287
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:25,501
God-damnit, we need to get to the new Prime Minister! NOW!

288
00:15:25,536 --> 00:15:26,841
Oh yeah, the Prime Minister, eh?

289
00:15:26,842 --> 00:15:28,570
He sure has screwed up things for Newfoundland.

290
00:15:28,571 --> 00:15:31,168
Life just hasn't been the same since he made sodomy illegal.

291
00:15:31,259 --> 00:15:35,079
Well, come with us! Maybe you can ask him to take his sodomy ban away.

292
00:15:35,114 --> 00:15:36,716
Can we just get going, please?

293
00:15:36,751 --> 00:15:38,442
Yeah, sure, except there's just one problem.

294
00:15:38,477 --> 00:15:39,431
What?

295
00:15:39,466 --> 00:15:40,744
You folks are goin' the wrong way.

296
00:15:41,345 --> 00:15:43,729
What?? But I thought there was one road in Canada.

297
00:15:43,764 --> 00:15:45,776
Yeah. And you all went the wrong direction on it.

298
00:15:45,811 --> 00:15:48,516
Ohh, that's right. Ottawa is that way.

299
00:15:48,551 --> 00:15:51,442
Of course. Ottawa left, Newfoundland right!

300
00:15:51,905 --> 00:15:53,025
Oh no!

301
00:15:53,060 --> 00:15:54,582
How could you be so stupid!

302
00:15:55,038 --> 00:15:57,870
There's no way we can go all the way back. We'll never make it now!

303
00:15:57,905 --> 00:16:03,198
It's okay, boys. The power is inside us to get to Ottawa! We can wish ourselves there!

304
00:16:03,233 --> 00:16:05,154
Ah yes, let's wish ourselves there.

305
00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:13,709
Is it working?

306
00:16:13,744 --> 00:16:17,855
Oh, God-damnit! Well I warned you Kyle! I told you if I missed Christmas we were gonna throw down!  

307
00:16:17,856 --> 00:16:20,682
Well it's on! We're gonna have it our RIGHT NOW!

308
00:16:21,427 --> 00:16:23,561
Of course, we could always take my boat, eh?

309
00:16:24,347 --> 00:16:27,288
Oh yes! On the river we could travel to Ottawa in no time!

310
00:16:27,775 --> 00:16:28,720
Well come on!

311
00:16:30,526 --> 00:16:32,536
Okay, next stop, the new Prime Minister.

312
00:16:33,828 --> 00:16:35,620
Do you think we can still make it in time?

313
00:16:35,655 --> 00:16:37,766
We'd better, Kyle. Or you're dead.

314
00:16:43,983 --> 00:16:45,479
Here we are at the Parliament buildin'.

315
00:16:45,514 --> 00:16:47,149
Ze Prime Minister is inside.

316
00:16:47,362 --> 00:16:49,188
Well come on, let's hurry! It's almost Christmas!

317
00:16:53,684 --> 00:16:54,795
Yes?

318
00:16:55,243 --> 00:16:56,835
We need to see the new Prime Minister.

319
00:16:56,870 --> 00:17:00,434
Ha! Impossible! The new Prime Minister isn't seeing anybody!

320
00:17:01,466 --> 00:17:03,178
Oh well, zo much for zat.

321
00:17:03,213 --> 00:17:05,872
Yeah, we gave it our best, but our best wasn't good enough, eh?

322
00:17:05,907 --> 00:17:07,828
No. No!!

323
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:10,327
Yes?

324
00:17:10,362 --> 00:17:14,165
Please, sir. I traveled a long way to get here. He's the only person who can help me.

325
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:17,753
The Prime Minister isn't here. He's in China on official business.

326
00:17:17,754 --> 00:17:20,124
So you might as well go home. Good-bye!

327
00:17:20,159 --> 00:17:25,075
Then that's it. I'm... I'm never going to get my brother back.

328
00:17:25,786 --> 00:17:29,428
And... I'm not going to get any Christmas presents.

329
00:17:29,913 --> 00:17:31,939
And... I'm not gonna have a Christmas adventure.

330
00:17:31,974 --> 00:17:33,352
(And I'm not gonna have a ...)

331
00:17:39,184 --> 00:17:41,472
Oh please! Please stop crying.

332
00:17:42,269 --> 00:17:43,108
I'm gonna kill you, Kyle.

333
00:17:43,947 --> 00:17:47,465
All right all right, I was lying. The Prime Minister IS here.

334
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:48,251
Really?

335
00:17:48,286 --> 00:17:49,261
Yes yes. Come in.

336
00:17:56,661 --> 00:18:01,048
I am the Prime Minister of Canada. What do you guys want?

337
00:18:03,006 --> 00:18:08,009
Sir, you recently passed a new law allowing parents who have given their children up for adoption to change their minds. 

338
00:18:08,010 --> 00:18:09,379
My little brother was-

339
00:18:09,415 --> 00:18:10,284
Not so fast!

340
00:18:11,423 --> 00:18:11,974
Ike!

341
00:18:12,009 --> 00:18:12,690
Kyle!

342
00:18:13,488 --> 00:18:15,699
Prime Minister, these are the child's Canadian parents!

343
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:17,870
Their Canadian blood pumps through his veins!

344
00:18:17,871 --> 00:18:21,099
Would you send him back to America with those world-hungry scum?!

345
00:18:21,155 --> 00:18:22,446
Please, sir.

346
00:18:22,447 --> 00:18:24,772
I came because I don't think Ike belongs here.

347
00:18:24,773 --> 00:18:30,098
Family isn't about whose blood you have in you, family is about the people who cared about you and took care of you.

348
00:18:30,099 --> 00:18:32,794
We're not the same blood, but I love my little brother.

349
00:18:32,795 --> 00:18:38,267
We've taken care of him because he needed us to, and that makes us more family than anything.

350
00:18:40,541 --> 00:18:42,629
That is a great speech, guy. 

351
00:18:42,630 --> 00:18:47,971
But the answer is no! All of my new laws will stay in effect forever!

352
00:18:48,580 --> 00:18:50,333
Haha, you lose, Americans!

353
00:18:50,368 --> 00:18:53,379
Then, I suppose us mounties will never get our horses.

354
00:18:53,414 --> 00:18:55,133
And we won't get our wine.

355
00:18:55,168 --> 00:18:57,204
And we can't perform sodomy, eh?

356
00:18:57,239 --> 00:18:59,294
But why are you making such strange laws??

357
00:18:59,329 --> 00:19:00,827
I SAID GO!

358
00:19:03,807 --> 00:19:05,982
Oh my God, they've killed Kenny!

359
00:19:06,017 --> 00:19:08,115
You... bastards!

360
00:19:08,116 --> 00:19:10,130
Wha, what the hell is wrong with you?? 

361
00:19:10,131 --> 00:19:12,877
What kind of Prime Minister bases his decisions on hatred?

362
00:19:12,878 --> 00:19:15,909
And, and takes away mounties' horses?  And French people's wine?

363
00:19:15,910 --> 00:19:18,309
What the hell kind of Prime Minister are you, anyway?!

364
00:19:18,344 --> 00:19:20,931
I am the Prime Minister of Canada.

365
00:19:20,932 --> 00:19:23,036
I can do whatever I-

366
00:19:24,974 --> 00:19:28,817
Uh oh. Uh, don't mind that guy hiding in the spider hole, he's just my friend.

367
00:19:28,849 --> 00:19:29,632
What the hell??

368
00:19:29,954 --> 00:19:31,743
Hey, that looks like Saddam Hussein!

369
00:19:31,778 --> 00:19:35,522
Saddam Hussein?? Naw, relax, baby. I'm not him.

370
00:19:35,943 --> 00:19:39,309
Zat explains everything! Za new Prime Minister was Saddam Hussein,

371
00:19:39,310 --> 00:19:42,470
...once again trying to take over our beloved Canada like he did before.

372
00:19:42,583 --> 00:19:43,616
Saddam Hussein?

373
00:19:43,651 --> 00:19:44,913
He was fooling us?

374
00:19:44,948 --> 00:19:45,835
Get him!

375
00:19:45,870 --> 00:19:50,341
Ahh, don't shoot. I want to negotiate. Hey, relax!  Gah!

376
00:19:51,076 --> 00:19:55,105
Wait a minute. This means all the Prime Minister's new laws are null and void.

377
00:19:55,106 --> 00:19:56,625
We can have our horses back!

378
00:19:56,904 --> 00:19:58,253
And we can drink our wine.

379
00:19:58,288 --> 00:20:00,113
And I can sodomize me boys again

380
00:20:00,570 --> 00:20:04,583
Young man, you... must really care for Peter to have come all this way.

381
00:20:04,618 --> 00:20:06,944
Perhaps we were wrong to try and take Peter back.

382
00:20:06,945 --> 00:20:09,811
He doesn't belong here. He belongs with his family.

383
00:20:09,897 --> 00:20:12,858
Peter, would you like to go back to your home in Colorado?

384
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:21,960
What is that?

385
00:20:21,995 --> 00:20:24,969
It's Christmas. We officially missed it.

386
00:20:24,970 --> 00:20:28,263
It's Christmas Day and ... I'm in Canada.

387
00:20:28,402 --> 00:20:30,365
Wull yeah, but ah-I got my brother back.

388
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:33,592
Yeah! You got your brother back, but I didn't get any presents!

389
00:20:33,593 --> 00:20:35,089
And what did I tell you, Kyle?!

390
00:20:35,090 --> 00:20:38,859
I told you that if we didn't make it back in time for Christmas I was gonna whup your ass, didn't I?!

391
00:20:38,860 --> 00:20:39,843
Dude, come on.

392
00:20:39,878 --> 00:20:41,020
Well now you're gonna get it, motherfucker!

393
00:20:41,021 --> 00:20:43,843
That's right! You and me! Right now!  We're havin' it out!

394
00:20:43,844 --> 00:20:46,679
Let's go! Come on! Come on!!

395
00:20:56,893 --> 00:21:01,385
Mooooooom! Moooooooom!

396
00:21:01,578 --> 00:21:04,959
Ey, come on, boys! You can spend Christmas with us, Canada style!

397
00:21:09,074 --> 00:21:10,730
<i>Ding dong, they caught Saddam!</i>

398
00:21:10,731 --> 00:21:11,731
<i>Merry Christmas to the world!</i>

399
00:21:12,380 --> 00:21:15,330
<i>Ding dong, the Americans caught Saddam!</i>

400
00:21:15,964 --> 00:21:19,018
<i>Now Canada is free for you and you and me</i>

401
00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:21,982
<i>It's the best Christmas presents we ever got</i>

402
00:21:22,016 --> 00:21:23,720
<i>Canadian Christmas, it's the best!</i>

403
00:21:23,721 --> 00:21:25,347
<i>We drink and dance and show our breasts!</i>

404
00:21:25,382 --> 00:21:28,729
<i>Let's celebrate! Saddam Hussein's been caught!</i>

405
00:21:29,690 --> 00:21:32,702
Oh well. Maybe we'll get to have a Christmas adventure next year.
