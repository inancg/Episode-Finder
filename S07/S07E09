1
00:00:41,723 --> 00:00:42,840
God damnit!

2
00:00:42,841 --> 00:00:46,145
Stan, are you okay?

3
00:00:46,146 --> 00:00:47,860
Yeah, dad. We're just rehearsing our band.

4
00:00:47,861 --> 00:00:53,172
Ooohhh, I thought a group of Vietnamese people were having their intestines pulled out through their mouths.

5
00:00:57,939 --> 00:01:01,250
He's right, dude. We have to define our style if we're ever going to make a platinum album.

6
00:01:01,251 --> 00:01:04,464
I mean, ah I'm a fusion guy, but Kenny's background is more Latin Jazz.

7
00:01:04,464 --> 00:01:05,397
(What? Is it?)

8
00:01:05,432 --> 00:01:07,573
Yeah, and I'm more hip-hop and R-and-B oriented.

9
00:01:07,608 --> 00:01:11,252
I think out band better buy a whole bunch of music CDs to listen to for inspiration.

10
00:01:12,047 --> 00:01:13,113
Inspiration.

11
00:01:13,583 --> 00:01:14,114
Wait a minute, that's it. Inspiration, you guys. Don't you see?

12
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:18,255
See what?

13
00:01:18,290 --> 00:01:21,044
Our band should play Christian rock!

14
00:01:22,831 --> 00:01:23,908
Christian rock?!

15
00:01:23,943 --> 00:01:26,260
Think about it! It's the easiest crappiest music in the world, right?

16
00:01:26,261 --> 00:01:30,470
If we just play songs about how much we love Jesus, all the Christiand will buy our crap!

17
00:01:30,598 --> 00:01:32,273
That's a retarded idea, Cartman!

18
00:01:32,308 --> 00:01:33,250
It worked for Creed!

19
00:01:33,285 --> 00:01:35,272
I don't wanna be in a stupid Christian rock band!

20
00:01:35,307 --> 00:01:38,169
You just start that way, Stan, then you cross over. It's genious!

21
00:01:38,204 --> 00:01:41,805
Just get the hell out of here, Cartman! You're not serious and you're a detriment to the band!

22
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:47,157
Oh yeah?! I will bet you ten bucks that if I start a Christian rock band that I can get a platinum album before you guys do!

23
00:01:47,192 --> 00:01:48,415
You're on, fat boy!

24
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:49,872
Okay, fine! Ready?!

25
00:01:49,873 --> 00:01:50,247
First one to have a platinum album wins! Go!

26
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,377
What a stupid asshole!

27
00:01:59,773 --> 00:02:01,292
Platinum album! Platinum album!

28
00:02:01,293 --> 00:02:02,874
Gotta make a platinum album before Kyle!

29
00:02:04,937 --> 00:02:05,913
Oh, hi Eric.

30
00:02:05,948 --> 00:02:07,719
Butters! Get your drum set and meet me at my house!

31
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:09,479
We have to make a platinum album! Hurry, Butters!

32
00:02:11,277 --> 00:02:12,355
...Ohhh!

33
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:15,675
No time to waste! Platinum album! Must beat Kyle!

34
00:02:16,448 --> 00:02:19,746
Token! Get the bass guitar out of your basement and meet me over at my house!

35
00:02:20,245 --> 00:02:22,247
What?! We don't have a bass guitar.

36
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:26,479
Your family's black, Token! There's bound to be a bass guitar in your basement somewhere!

37
00:02:31,222 --> 00:02:34,797
Whoa, you sure seem with it, Eric. You must have some... ih-inspiration.

38
00:02:34,832 --> 00:02:37,989
Yes, the tears of Kyle Broflovski when he loses his ten dollars to me.

39
00:02:38,136 --> 00:02:40,363
Hey, there was a bass guitar in my basement.

40
00:02:40,398 --> 00:02:41,460
I told you, Token.

41
00:02:41,755 --> 00:02:42,917
So, what are we doing?

42
00:02:42,952 --> 00:02:45,071
Gentlemen, we are about to embark on the most amazing,

43
00:02:45,072 --> 00:02:47,992
...life-affirming, financially-windfalling experiences of our young lives.

44
00:02:48,206 --> 00:02:49,032
Wow!

45
00:02:49,067 --> 00:02:51,716
We are going to start... a Christian rock band.

46
00:02:52,382 --> 00:02:53,855
Awww.

47
00:02:53,890 --> 00:02:55,038
I'm out.

48
00:02:56,091 --> 00:02:58,517
Wait! Walk out that door, Token, and you'll regret it the rest of your life!

49
00:02:58,518 --> 00:03:01,788
Christians have a built-in audience of over one hundred and eighty million Americans!

50
00:03:01,789 --> 00:03:05,196
If each one of them buys just one of our albums at twelve dollars and ninety-five cents that would be-

51
00:03:05,474 --> 00:03:08,297
Two billion, three hundred and thirty one million dollars.

52
00:03:08,332 --> 00:03:09,689
Still want to leave, Token?

53
00:03:11,605 --> 00:03:12,782
Thank you.

54
00:03:14,438 --> 00:03:16,058
Dad, can I borrow three hundred dollars?

55
00:03:16,721 --> 00:03:18,668
Three hundred dollars?? What in the world for??

56
00:03:18,703 --> 00:03:20,842
Our band can't find a stylistic direction to go in.

57
00:03:20,843 --> 00:03:24,115
We need to go down to the mall to buy hundreds of CDs to listen to so we can define our sound.

58
00:03:24,814 --> 00:03:27,134
Sorry Kyle, we gave you your allowance already.

59
00:03:27,169 --> 00:03:30,582
Ugh. Can't you see this is my dream?? Music is my life!

60
00:03:30,964 --> 00:03:32,327
It wasn't your life yesterday.

61
00:03:32,362 --> 00:03:35,812
Hold it. Pops, I've got the music inside me. It's in my soul.

62
00:03:35,813 --> 00:03:38,038
And I know my place is up on that stage.

63
00:03:38,039 --> 00:03:40,689
I'm gonna make it to the top. And I just want your blessing, Pops.

64
00:03:41,070 --> 00:03:42,126
The answer is no, Kyle.

65
00:03:42,161 --> 00:03:44,164
Aw, come on Dad, don't be such a Jew!

66
00:03:44,199 --> 00:03:46,254
Kyle, don't belittle your own people!

67
00:03:48,259 --> 00:03:49,062
Hey dude.

68
00:03:49,097 --> 00:03:52,249
It didn't work! My stupid Jew dad won't lend me money for CDs!

69
00:03:52,284 --> 00:03:55,984
No, dude, it's cool. Kenny says you can download music for free on the Internet!

70
00:03:56,019 --> 00:03:56,742
Really?

71
00:03:56,777 --> 00:03:57,386
(Yeah!)

72
00:03:57,421 --> 00:03:58,359
You got a computer?

73
00:04:00,541 --> 00:04:02,826
See? Everyone on the Internet copies their music from their CDs,

74
00:04:02,827 --> 00:04:04,998
...and then we can download them for free and play them on the computer!

75
00:04:05,002 --> 00:04:08,723
All right, cool. Let's donwload some Metallica, and some Stevie Wonder.

76
00:04:08,867 --> 00:04:10,608
(Oh you forgot to get some Judas Priest.)

77
00:04:10,643 --> 00:04:12,753
Kenny's right. We should download some Judas Priest, too.

78
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,094
Judas Priest. Wow! Downloading music for free is awesome!

79
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:20,360
What the hell is that?

80
00:04:20,395 --> 00:04:21,532
I don't know. Let me go check.

81
00:04:22,274 --> 00:04:23,770
Freeze!! FBI!!

82
00:04:25,178 --> 00:04:26,628
Down on the ground! Down on the ground!

83
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:30,890
Hurry up! Let me see those hands!

84
00:04:31,814 --> 00:04:34,578
Tango Teamus to Point Bravo! Suspects in custody!

85
00:04:35,646 --> 00:04:38,612
Move move move move move move! All clear, men! Get your ass going!

86
00:04:40,258 --> 00:04:41,813
Kyle, what did you do?!

87
00:04:41,848 --> 00:04:42,559
I don't know!

88
00:04:43,889 --> 00:04:46,043
All right, guys, this is gonna be so easy.

89
00:04:46,044 --> 00:04:50,806
All we have to do to make Christian songs is take regular old songs and add Jesus stuff to them.

90
00:04:50,807 --> 00:04:56,017
See? All we have to do is cross out words like "baby" and "Darling" and replace them with...

91
00:04:56,018 --> 00:04:57,991
...Jesus.

92
00:04:57,992 --> 00:05:00,133
All right, Butters, give me a beat.

93
00:05:04,135 --> 00:05:07,217
Okay, nice. Very nice. All right, Token, give me a smooth bass line.

94
00:05:08,846 --> 00:05:10,137
I don't know how to play bass.

95
00:05:11,017 --> 00:05:13,011
Token, how many times do we have to go through this?

96
00:05:13,012 --> 00:05:14,527
You're black. You can play bass.

97
00:05:15,019 --> 00:05:16,553
I'm gettin' sick of your stereotypes!

98
00:05:16,588 --> 00:05:18,945
Be as sick as you want, just give me a God-damned bass line!

99
00:05:24,073 --> 00:05:24,835
God-damnit!

100
00:05:27,458 --> 00:05:29,549
All right. Nice, fellas. Nice.

101
00:05:29,584 --> 00:05:32,956
<i>I need you in my life, Jesus.</i>

102
00:05:33,646 --> 00:05:37,151
<i>I can't live without you, Jesus</i>

103
00:05:37,186 --> 00:05:41,894
<i>And I just want to feel you deep inside me, Jesus.</i>

104
00:05:42,321 --> 00:05:43,451
Awesome!

105
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,275
Um, sir-

106
00:05:57,276 --> 00:05:58,233
Shiut up!!

107
00:06:00,618 --> 00:06:02,949
You downloaded a lot of songs!

108
00:06:02,950 --> 00:06:06,016
Says here you even downlaoded Judas Priest?

109
00:06:06,017 --> 00:06:08,316
That's hard time you boys are lookin' at.

110
00:06:08,317 --> 00:06:10,475
You got anything to say for yourselves?

111
00:06:11,003 --> 00:06:13,609
We d-didn't think it was that big a deal.

112
00:06:14,161 --> 00:06:16,121
Not a big deal!

113
00:06:16,365 --> 00:06:21,130
You think downloading music for free is not a big deal?!

114
00:06:21,502 --> 00:06:25,049
Put your couts on! I'm gonna show you something!

115
00:06:25,050 --> 00:06:27,431
And I don't think you're gonna like it!

116
00:06:28,217 --> 00:06:32,028
This is the home of Lars Ulrich, the drummer for Metallica.

117
00:06:33,532 --> 00:06:36,540
Look. There's Lars now, sitting by his pool.

118
00:06:37,204 --> 00:06:38,581
What's the matter with him?

119
00:06:38,616 --> 00:06:43,282
This month he was hoping to have a gold-plated shark tank bar installed right next to the pool,

120
00:06:43,283 --> 00:06:45,806
...but thanks to people downloading his music for free,

121
00:06:45,807 --> 00:06:49,418
...he must now wait a few months before he can afford it.

122
00:06:50,703 --> 00:06:52,516
Come. There's more.

123
00:06:53,147 --> 00:06:57,049
Here's Britney Spears' private jet. Notice anything?

124
00:06:57,659 --> 00:06:59,923
Britney used to have a Gulfstream IV.

125
00:06:59,924 --> 00:07:06,729
Now she's had to sell it and get a Gulfstream III because people like you chose to download her music for free.

126
00:07:08,593 --> 00:07:12,910
The Gulfstream III doesn't even have a remote control for its surround-sound DVD system.

127
00:07:12,911 --> 00:07:16,199
Still think downloading music for free is no big deal?

128
00:07:16,234 --> 00:07:19,353
We... didn't realize what we were doing, eh...

129
00:07:19,388 --> 00:07:21,068
That is the folly of man.

130
00:07:21,351 --> 00:07:23,125
Now look in this window.

131
00:07:23,126 --> 00:07:26,127
Here you see the loving family of Master P.

132
00:07:26,128 --> 00:07:31,220
Next week is his son's birthday and, all he's ever wanted was an island in French Polynesia.

133
00:07:31,255 --> 00:07:32,729
So, he's gonna get it, right?

134
00:07:33,877 --> 00:07:35,787
I see an island without an owner.

135
00:07:35,788 --> 00:07:37,866
If things keep going the way they are,

136
00:07:37,867 --> 00:07:40,693
...the child will not get his tropical paradise.

137
00:07:40,728 --> 00:07:43,312
We're sorry! We'll, we'll never download music for free again!

138
00:07:43,347 --> 00:07:48,116
Man must learn to think of these horrible outcomes before he acts selfishly or else...

139
00:07:48,117 --> 00:07:53,829
I fear... recording artists will be forever doomed to a life of only semi-luxury.

140
00:07:57,697 --> 00:07:59,193
Almost there, you guys.

141
00:08:01,310 --> 00:08:03,788
Why the hell did you tell us to dress nice to take us out here?

142
00:08:03,823 --> 00:08:06,415
Because, Token, we have to take pictures for our album cover.

143
00:08:06,416 --> 00:08:10,156
The key to a hot-selling Christian album is a flashy inspirational album cover.

144
00:08:10,191 --> 00:08:12,389
Wow, neato! An album cover!

145
00:08:12,424 --> 00:08:15,260
This Christian album better make as much money as you said it would, tubby!

146
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,779
I'm going to kill you one day, Token.

147
00:08:18,814 --> 00:08:19,599
What did you say?!

148
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:22,462
Nothing. All right, guys, stand over there and look wholesome and cool.

149
00:08:22,463 --> 00:08:24,497
I have a timer on this thing so I can get in the shot too.

150
00:08:25,229 --> 00:08:26,720
Cheese!

151
00:08:26,755 --> 00:08:29,016
No no no! Haven't you guys ever seen an album cover?

152
00:08:29,017 --> 00:08:32,083
You're supposed to be standing in random places, looking away like you don't care!

153
00:08:35,415 --> 00:08:36,361
Cheese!

154
00:08:36,490 --> 00:08:39,723
No! Butters, you can't look happy on the album cover! That's not cool!

155
00:08:39,758 --> 00:08:40,646
Oh...

156
00:08:40,681 --> 00:08:41,953
Token, look away to the right.

157
00:08:42,276 --> 00:08:43,234
More.

158
00:08:43,235 --> 00:08:44,171
More!

159
00:08:44,253 --> 00:08:46,158
Why the hell would I be looking way over there??

160
00:08:46,193 --> 00:08:49,309
So it looks like you're too cool to care that you're on an album cover, you black asshole!

161
00:08:49,310 --> 00:08:50,722
Now just hold it!

162
00:08:55,295 --> 00:08:59,642
<i>Don't ever leave me, Jesus. I couldn't stand to see you go.</i>

163
00:09:00,232 --> 00:09:04,517
<i>My heart would simply snap, my Lord, if you walked on out that door.</i>

164
00:09:05,328 --> 00:09:09,408
<i>I promise I'll be good to you, and keep you warm at night.</i>

165
00:09:09,859 --> 00:09:14,516
<i>Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, why don't we just... shut off the lights.</i>

166
00:09:22,289 --> 00:09:25,413
Thanks for releasing them to us, detective. Sorry for all the trouble they caused.

167
00:09:25,448 --> 00:09:28,166
It's all right. I think these boys learned their lesson.

168
00:09:28,201 --> 00:09:29,159
Boy, I'll say!

169
00:09:29,194 --> 00:09:33,884
If you parents will just step over here, you can pay their four hundred dollar release and penalty fees.

170
00:09:33,919 --> 00:09:37,088
Four hundred dollars? Just for downloading some songs off the Internet?

171
00:09:37,089 --> 00:09:38,311
It's not that big a deal.

172
00:09:38,341 --> 00:09:41,742
Not a big deal, huh?! Come with me!

173
00:09:41,743 --> 00:09:43,508
I'm gonna show you something!

174
00:09:43,509 --> 00:09:46,187
And I don't think you're gonna like it!

175
00:09:47,228 --> 00:09:51,118
Wugh, dude. I can't wait to just go back home and get back to band practice.

176
00:09:51,153 --> 00:09:51,849
(Yeah)

177
00:09:51,884 --> 00:09:53,795
No! Didn't you guys learn anything?

178
00:09:53,796 --> 00:09:58,431
Look, if we make an album, all that's gonna happen is that people are gonna steal our songs for free off the Internet.

179
00:09:58,432 --> 00:09:59,802
We won't make a dime!

180
00:09:59,837 --> 00:10:00,688
Oh yeah.

181
00:10:00,723 --> 00:10:04,990
Until we get people to stop downloading music for free, I say we refuse to play!

182
00:10:05,025 --> 00:10:05,921
(Yeah!)

183
00:10:06,287 --> 00:10:11,612
Tom, I'm standing in South Park, Colorado, where the rock band, MOOP, has refused to play.

184
00:10:11,613 --> 00:10:14,546
The strike started yesterday and could go well into next week.

185
00:10:15,687 --> 00:10:17,169
Oh hey guys. How's it going?

186
00:10:17,204 --> 00:10:19,195
We're not letting you back in the band, Cartman! Fuck off!

187
00:10:19,230 --> 00:10:20,981
I don't wanna be in your crappy band, guys.

188
00:10:20,982 --> 00:10:23,758
I just wanted to let you know, the album for my Christian rock band,

189
00:10:23,759 --> 00:10:26,318
Faith + 1, is about to go platinum.

190
00:10:26,803 --> 00:10:27,585
It is??

191
00:10:27,620 --> 00:10:30,302
That's right. We already sold thirteen copies.

192
00:10:30,303 --> 00:10:32,460
You wanna pay me that ten-dollar bet, Kyle?

193
00:10:35,114 --> 00:10:38,259
You get a platinum album for selling one million copies, you fat turd!

194
00:10:38,294 --> 00:10:39,991
It's just a matter of time, my friends.

195
00:10:39,992 --> 00:10:43,722
This weekend is Christfest. The single largest gathering of Christians in the Midwest.

196
00:10:43,723 --> 00:10:46,277
Each one of them a walkng, praying wallet full of cash.

197
00:10:46,278 --> 00:10:47,786
And I'll be there selling my album.

198
00:10:48,273 --> 00:10:50,230
You'll never get a platinum album doing Christian rock, Cartman!

199
00:10:50,231 --> 00:10:52,742
It was a stupid idea then, and it's a stupid idea now!

200
00:10:52,743 --> 00:10:54,742
Yeah, you don't even know anything about Christianity.

201
00:10:54,777 --> 00:10:56,475
I know enough to exploit it.

202
00:10:56,476 --> 00:10:57,476
Just get that ten bucks ready, Kyle. Tata!

203
00:10:59,686 --> 00:11:00,447
Go ahead!

204
00:11:00,448 --> 00:11:03,216
People will just download your songs for free on the Internet anyways!

205
00:11:03,251 --> 00:11:05,343
What a dumbass. Our band is way cooler than his.

206
00:11:05,378 --> 00:11:06,218
(Yeah.)

207
00:11:12,664 --> 00:11:15,733
Psalm T-Shirts! Get a T-Shirt with your favorite psalm!

208
00:11:15,768 --> 00:11:17,731
Leather-bound bibles. Show your faith.

209
00:11:18,405 --> 00:11:21,412
Yes, it's really the best Christian album that's evern been produced, actually..

210
00:11:21,447 --> 00:11:23,685
Oh, this will be great for my grandchildren.

211
00:11:23,686 --> 00:11:26,878
They need hip cool music, but with inspirational lyrics.

212
00:11:27,081 --> 00:11:29,527
I think that's what the whole world needs, praise Christ.

213
00:11:29,562 --> 00:11:32,036
Huh we're not really Christians, we're just pretendin' we are.

214
00:11:34,430 --> 00:11:36,594
Butters, remind me later to cut your balls off.

215
00:11:36,629 --> 00:11:41,940
All right, everyone! Welcome to Christfest 2003!

216
00:11:42,689 --> 00:11:44,968
Are you ready for some live music?

217
00:11:46,735 --> 00:11:47,950
Yeah Jesus!

218
00:11:49,669 --> 00:11:54,625
Then let's give it up now for one of Christian rock's biggest bands! Trinity!

219
00:11:55,707 --> 00:12:00,404
<i>The Shepherd and the Light, and His Word lifted me up</i>

220
00:12:00,439 --> 00:12:05,205
<i>And I praise His Holy Name wherever I go.</i>

221
00:12:06,161 --> 00:12:06,823
Damnit!

222
00:12:06,824 --> 00:12:09,642
If we're gonna sell our hot Christian album, we have got to get on that stage!

223
00:12:09,799 --> 00:12:11,847
Hey is this the way to the backstage?

224
00:12:11,882 --> 00:12:12,698
Who are you?

225
00:12:12,733 --> 00:12:14,221
We're the band Sanctified.

226
00:12:14,222 --> 00:12:17,207
We play metal and punk, but with lyrics that inspire faith in Christ.

227
00:12:17,425 --> 00:12:20,572
Yeah. We proved that Christian music can be tough and hard core.

228
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:22,278
Yeah, you guys are real hard core.

229
00:12:22,313 --> 00:12:24,546
You bet your gosh-darned rear end we are!

230
00:12:24,950 --> 00:12:27,338
All right, uhh, Sanctified, you guys are up next.

231
00:12:27,373 --> 00:12:28,967
Yeah! Let's do it!

232
00:12:29,333 --> 00:12:32,925
Sent down from Heaven! The Spirit and the Glory!

233
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:36,687
Eh hey guys, wait, uh, ..we wannaaa play with you before you go onstage.

234
00:12:36,722 --> 00:12:38,126
Well, that, that's cool.

235
00:12:38,161 --> 00:12:40,179
Always good to be praying before you're playin'.

236
00:12:40,214 --> 00:12:42,218
Let's just go over here so we can hear ourselves better.

237
00:12:42,219 --> 00:12:45,430
Lord, Father in Heaven, we thank you for all your blessings and we...

238
00:12:48,185 --> 00:12:50,689
Hey, Eric, I don't think they can get out.

239
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:56,987
All right, Christians, how are you feeling tonight?

240
00:12:57,022 --> 00:13:00,689
Praise Jesus! Praise him! My Lord!

241
00:13:00,724 --> 00:13:04,212
Let's keep this salvation train going with the hot band, Sanctified!

242
00:13:04,902 --> 00:13:06,524
That's Faith + 1.

243
00:13:06,559 --> 00:13:08,406
Uh. Uh apparently there's been a change.

244
00:13:08,407 --> 00:13:12,235
Give it up for ... Faith + 1!

245
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,276
You know, Jesus?

246
00:13:16,277 --> 00:13:22,974
I've been thinking a lot about you lately and, well, that's why I wrote this song.

247
00:13:23,009 --> 00:13:29,410
<i>I love you, Jesus. I want you to walk with me</i>

248
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:36,851
<i>I'll take good care of you baby. Call you my baby, baby!</i>

249
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:43,456
<i>You died for my sins, and you know that I would die for you, right?</i>

250
00:13:43,491 --> 00:13:51,498
<i>What's the matter, baby? You tremble at Jesus, baby!</i>

251
00:13:51,499 --> 00:13:53,997
Your love... is my life!

252
00:13:53,998 --> 00:13:58,203
<i>You know when I’m without you, there's a black hole in my life! Oo-ohhh!</i>

253
00:13:58,238 --> 00:14:04,405
<i>I wanna believe. It's all right, 'cause I get lonely in the night and it's up to you to</i>

254
00:14:14,775 --> 00:14:17,212
Dude, I didn't know being in a band was gonna be this tough.

255
00:14:17,247 --> 00:14:18,141
Yeah, it's tough.

256
00:14:18,142 --> 00:14:21,042
But it's times like these that... you see what your band is made of.

257
00:14:21,043 --> 00:14:23,323
We've gotta fight through the rough times like Journey!

258
00:14:23,358 --> 00:14:27,820
"Tom, we're now entering the second day of the rock band MOOP's refusal to play,

259
00:14:27,821 --> 00:14:31,251
and the second day of absolutely no other news to report on.

260
00:14:31,252 --> 00:14:36,948
In a recent poll we asked people if MOOP's refusal to play would stop them from downloading music off the Internet.

261
00:14:36,949 --> 00:14:40,004
One percent said yes. Two percent said no.

262
00:14:40,005 --> 00:14:43,262
And ninety-seven percent said, "Who the hell is MOOP?!"

263
00:14:43,555 --> 00:14:44,774
Back to you, Tom.

264
00:14:44,809 --> 00:14:48,269
Hey, are you the guys protesting free Internet music downloading?

265
00:14:48,304 --> 00:14:49,837
Hey, it's that Lars Ulrich guy!

266
00:14:49,872 --> 00:14:53,345
That's right. Metallica is behind you dudes a thousand percent!

267
00:14:53,694 --> 00:14:57,644
We're gonna sit here and protest with you until free downloadin' stop, hyeah!

268
00:14:57,679 --> 00:15:01,088
Tom, it appears now the musicians' strike is growing!

269
00:15:01,089 --> 00:15:03,945
As I'm speaking, more musicians are arriving!

270
00:15:04,359 --> 00:15:11,538
It looks like Alanis Morissette, Blink 182, Britney Spears, and dozens of others are going to join MOOP in not playing music.

271
00:15:11,539 --> 00:15:14,054
This is a veritable Strikapalooza!

272
00:15:19,222 --> 00:15:23,170
Guys, we here at Faith Records were very moved by your performance at Christfest.

273
00:15:23,171 --> 00:15:26,071
You're one of the most talented Christian rock bands we've ever heard!

274
00:15:26,807 --> 00:15:30,295
Thank you so much. Christ has really blessed us with talent.

275
00:15:31,543 --> 00:15:36,447
We just have one question, though. We were looking over some of your lyrics, uh...

276
00:15:36,448 --> 00:15:40,990
"I want to walk hand-in-hand with Jesus on a private beach for two."

277
00:15:40,991 --> 00:15:45,213
"I want him to nibble on my ear and say 'I'm here for you."

278
00:15:45,214 --> 00:15:48,384
Ih it seams you really love Christ.

279
00:15:48,419 --> 00:15:49,818
Yes, we sure do.

280
00:15:49,853 --> 00:15:54,014
Eh no but ih it appears you are actually... in love with Christ.

281
00:15:56,009 --> 00:15:58,850
Well what are you saying? That, that you don't really love Christ??

282
00:15:58,885 --> 00:16:01,055
Well uh of course I do. I mean I just-

283
00:16:01,090 --> 00:16:03,283
Well what's the difference?! You love Christ, you're in love with Christ,

284
00:16:03,284 --> 00:16:04,719
I mean, uh, what the heck is this??

285
00:16:04,754 --> 00:16:07,833
Uh, we'd just like to make sure the bands we sign are in it for God,

286
00:16:07,834 --> 00:16:08,834
and not for the money.

287
00:16:09,011 --> 00:16:13,016
I resent that, sir! I have never in my life done anything just for the money!

288
00:16:13,428 --> 00:16:15,863
If I'm lying may the Lord strike me down right now.

289
00:16:16,858 --> 00:16:18,131
Uhm, oh.

290
00:16:19,233 --> 00:16:23,279
That's- all we needed to know. Just, sign here and we'll get your album sold.

291
00:16:23,836 --> 00:16:28,758
K-tal Records presents the most inspirational Christian rock band in the world!

292
00:16:28,759 --> 00:16:30,513
Faith + 1,

00:16:30,514 --> 00:16:33,580

294
00:16:33,764 --> 00:16:36,309
<i>Oh Lord you are my Savior! </i>

295
00:16:36,310 --> 00:16:37,310
<i>You know I miss you so much when you are gone.</i>

296
00:16:39,866 --> 00:16:43,806
With great inspirational songs like "I Wasn't Born Again Yesterday"...

297
00:16:43,841 --> 00:16:49,570
<i>Yes I may be born again, but I was wasn't born again yesterday.</i>

298
00:16:49,605 --> 00:16:53,200
<i>I wanna get down on my knees and start pleasing Jesus!</i>

299
00:16:53,201 --> 00:16:56,443
<i>I wanna feel his salvation all over my face!</i>

300
00:16:56,478 --> 00:16:59,200
The CD is filled with instant classics.

301
00:16:59,201 --> 00:17:00,201
Who doesn't remember...

302
00:17:00,842 --> 00:17:04,352
<i>The Body of Christ! Sleek swimmer's body, all muscled up and toned!</i>

303
00:17:04,466 --> 00:17:08,049
<i>The Body of Christ! O, Lord Almighty, I wish I could call it my own!</i>

304
00:17:08,348 --> 00:17:14,548
<i>You're one time, two times, three times my Savior...</i>

305
00:17:14,583 --> 00:17:17,348
<i>Whenever I see Jesus up on that Cross</i>

306
00:17:17,349 --> 00:17:20,135
<i>I can't help but think that he looks kinda hot...</i>

307
00:17:20,170 --> 00:17:24,043
This album is not available in stores and limited quantities are available,

308
00:17:24,044 --> 00:17:25,044
...so order now!

309
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,623
I can't take this much longer.

310
00:17:30,624 --> 00:17:32,845
Maybe we're just, not cut out to be in a band.

311
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:34,767
You guys, we can't give up on our dreams now!

312
00:17:34,768 --> 00:17:37,075
As soon as this strike ends, we're gonna be the biggest band ever!

313
00:17:37,110 --> 00:17:41,072
Yeah, if we all give in now, people might never stop downloading our music for free!

314
00:17:41,107 --> 00:17:43,887
I'm sure we're gonna get word any minute that people have agreed to stop.

315
00:17:46,064 --> 00:17:48,517
Certified letter for the rock band MOOP?

316
00:17:48,552 --> 00:17:49,490
That's us!

317
00:17:52,167 --> 00:17:53,027
Dear MOOP.

318
00:17:53,028 --> 00:17:58,074
This letter is to inform you that Faith Plus One's debut album has just sold one million copies.

319
00:17:58,850 --> 00:17:59,387
What??

320
00:17:59,422 --> 00:18:02,546
We cordially invite you to attend the platinum album award ceremony,

321
00:18:02,547 --> 00:18:04,397
which will be held tomorrow morning at ten.

322
00:18:04,398 --> 00:18:06,582
Details and proof of sales enclosed.

323
00:18:06,583 --> 00:18:11,041
P.S. Nananana na na. Hahahaha ha ha.

324
00:18:12,518 --> 00:18:15,110
He did it. Cartman got a platinum album.

325
00:18:15,145 --> 00:18:17,157
Is this for real?? This is for real!

326
00:18:17,192 --> 00:18:18,382
He beat us.

327
00:18:18,383 --> 00:18:21,526
Because all this time we've been so caught up with how to protect our music

328
00:18:21,527 --> 00:18:22,527
...that we forgot to just play.

329
00:18:22,951 --> 00:18:25,393
But why play if we're not gonna make millions of dollars.

330
00:18:25,717 --> 00:18:27,376
Because that's what real artists do.

331
00:18:27,377 --> 00:18:30,492
People are always gonna find a way to copy our music and swap it for free.

332
00:18:30,493 --> 00:18:34,616
If we're real musicians, then we should just play and be stoked that so many people are listening.

333
00:18:34,651 --> 00:18:36,973
Besides, maybe our sound would have gotten downloaded for free,

334
00:18:36,974 --> 00:18:40,457
but if they were good songs then people still would have bought tickets to see our band in concert.

335
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,717
From now on, MOOP isn't about money. MOOP is about music!

336
00:18:43,718 --> 00:18:46,368
We're not striking anymore! Who's with us?!

337
00:18:47,824 --> 00:18:49,339
...We're just about the money.

338
00:18:49,374 --> 00:18:50,581
Yeah, yeah.

339
00:18:50,616 --> 00:18:51,968
Oh.

340
00:18:52,003 --> 00:18:55,217
So... Dude, what are you gonna do about your bet with Cartman. Are you- gonna pay 'im?

341
00:18:55,252 --> 00:18:56,499
I don't have a choice, dude.

342
00:18:56,500 --> 00:19:00,088
I'm gonna swallow my pride, face Cartman, and say "Congratulations. You were right"

343
00:19:00,089 --> 00:19:01,664
And I'm gonna give him the ten dollars.

344
00:19:01,665 --> 00:19:04,155
And hopefully, he won't make a big deal out of it.

345
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,380
Welcome! Welcome everyone!

346
00:19:14,381 --> 00:19:16,619
Please enjoy! The presentation should begin shortly.

347
00:19:16,654 --> 00:19:18,033
Cartman, what the hell is all this?

348
00:19:18,068 --> 00:19:20,361
Our platinum album ceremony. I spared no expense.

349
00:19:20,396 --> 00:19:21,969
But you spent all the money we made!

350
00:19:22,004 --> 00:19:25,942
We're Faith Plus One, Token, there'll be plenty more money. Relax and enjoy, black asshole.

351
00:19:25,943 --> 00:19:28,161
There's hors d'oeuvres and drinks by the Ferris wheel, everyone!

352
00:19:28,768 --> 00:19:31,785
Oh Kyle, guys, so nice to see you!

353
00:19:31,820 --> 00:19:34,881
Let's just get this over with, Cartman. You won the bet, here's ten dollars.

354
00:19:34,916 --> 00:19:36,881
Oh nonononono, not yet, Kyle. Hold on.

355
00:19:36,882 --> 00:19:39,189
Everyone! Everyone, can I have your attention please?

356
00:19:41,621 --> 00:19:43,355
We like to praise Christ!

357
00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:46,835
Yes, yes, thank you thank you. Praise Him. I think we're ready to start now.

358
00:19:49,353 --> 00:19:53,048
Welcome to the presentation ceremony for Faith Plus One.

359
00:19:55,117 --> 00:19:57,976
And now to present the award, here's Michael Collins.

360
00:19:58,405 --> 00:20:00,338
This is the worse day of my life.

361
00:20:00,373 --> 00:20:02,679
Ahhh, this is the best day of my life.

362
00:20:02,714 --> 00:20:06,065
Boys, in recognition for over one million records sold,

363
00:20:06,066 --> 00:20:10,570
the Christian Recording Industry is please to present you with this Myrrh album.

364
00:20:12,186 --> 00:20:14,319
Thank you very uh- wah? Myrrh album?

365
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:16,230
I thought albums win either gold or platinum.

366
00:20:16,265 --> 00:20:19,410
Nono, in Christian rock, our albums go gold and frankincense and myrrh.

367
00:20:19,411 --> 00:20:20,313
Congratulations!

368
00:20:20,796 --> 00:20:24,274
Ha! Our bet was that you would get a platinum album, not a myrrh album!

369
00:20:24,275 --> 00:20:25,858
I don't owe you anything, fat boy!

370
00:20:26,591 --> 00:20:29,142
You mean to tell me I could never get a platinum album with a Christian rock band?!

371
00:20:29,177 --> 00:20:30,633
No, but you can go double myrrh.

372
00:20:32,583 --> 00:20:34,243
GOD DAMNIT!!

373
00:20:36,062 --> 00:20:38,071
Oh, please don't take the Lord's Name in vain.

374
00:20:38,106 --> 00:20:42,151
Who cares?! I can never win my bet because you stupid assholes don't give out platinum albums!

375
00:20:42,186 --> 00:20:44,733
But you spread the Word of the Lord. You've brought faith in Jesus.

376
00:20:44,768 --> 00:20:46,352
OH, FUCK JESUS!!

377
00:20:48,687 --> 00:20:52,089
Eric, I-I'm pretty sure you shouldn't say the F-word about-uh Jesus.

378
00:20:52,124 --> 00:20:53,659
Yeah. You're gonna hurt the band.

379
00:20:53,694 --> 00:20:58,668
Who fuckin' cares, Token?! I could never beat Kyle now! I'll say it again! Fuck Jesus!

380
00:20:59,723 --> 00:21:01,215
My ears are bleeding!

381
00:21:01,250 --> 00:21:03,639
Good job, dickhead! You lost the entire audience!

382
00:21:03,674 --> 00:21:05,935
Ah, fuck you, Token! You black asshole!

383
00:21:14,407 --> 00:21:16,531
Hm. Guess he got what he deserved.

384
00:21:27,094 --> 00:21:29,222
Fuck you, Eric.



9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
