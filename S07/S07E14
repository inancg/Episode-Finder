I'M NINE YEARS OLD, DUDE !

IF I DON'T WORK THINGS OUT

00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:08,114
I COULD BE
ALONE MY WHOLE LIFE !

A LONG TIME AGO.

BEBE, YOU NEED TO GO
TALK TO WENDY FOR ME RIGHT NOW !

00:07:41,422 --> 00:07:43,152
NOW, I REALIZE I NEED HER
FRIENDS TO DO IT.

00:07:43,152 --> 00:07:44,018
TELL HER I LOVE HER.

YOU LOVE HER.

IF YOU REALLY WANT WENDY BACK,

198
00:07:47,477 --> 00:07:49,208
TRY DOING THE MOST ROMANTIC
THING YOU CAN THINK OF.

199
00:07:49,208 --> 00:07:53,967
OKAY, SO WHAT'S THE MOST
ROMANTIC THING I CAN THINK OF ?

IF YOU REALLY WANT A SHOT
AT GETTING HER BACK...

244

I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.

245
00:09:58,180 --> 00:10:00,343
SHE'S IN LOVE
WITH SOMEBODY ELSE.

246
00:10:00,343 --> 00:10:02,507
DUDE, YOU NEED TO
SNAP OUT OF THIS !

247
00:10:02,507 --> 00:10:04,237
SO WENDY LEFT YOU FOR TOKEN,
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO,

248
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:05,966
JUST BE MISERABLE
YOUR WHOLE LIFE ?

249
00:10:05,966 --> 00:10:07,263
THERE'S NOTHING ELSE
ICANDO,

250
00:10:07,263 --> 00:10:08,129
SHE WAS MY WHOLE LIFE.

251
00:10:08,562 --> 00:10:09,427
OH, COME ON, DUDE !

252
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:11,590
ALL YOU'VE DONE FOR THE LAST
FOUR DAYS IS MOPE AROUND !

253
00:10:12,023 --> 00:10:13,752
YOU MIGHT AS WELL GO
HANG OUT WITH THOSE GOTH KIDS,

254
00:10:13,752 --> 00:10:16,348
WHO DRESS IN BLACK AND TALK
ABOUT PAIN ALL THE TIME !

255
00:10:16,348 --> 00:10:18,944
MAYBE I SHOULD, AT LEAST
THEY WOULD UNDERSTAND ME.

256
00:10:19,377 --> 00:10:21,539
MAYBE I SHOULD GO HANG
WITH THE GOTH KIDS.

257
00:10:21,539 --> 00:10:25,865
LIFE IS PAIN,
LIFE IS ONLY PAIN.

258
00:10:25,865 --> 00:10:28,028
WE'RE ALL TAUGHT TO BELIEVE IN
HAPPY, FAIRY TALE ENDINGS,

259
00:10:28,028 --> 00:10:29,757
BUT THERE
IS ONLY BLACKNESS.

260
00:10:30,190 --> 00:10:33,651
DARK, DEPRESSING LONELINESS
THAT EATS AT YOUR SOUL.

261
00:10:33,651 --> 00:10:36,246
WHO NEEDS THAT
KEN AND BARBIE LOVE, ANYWAY ?

262
00:10:36,246 --> 00:10:38,842
EVERYONE'S JUST WALKING AROUND
LIKE A BUNCH OF CONFORMISTS.

263
00:10:38,842 --> 00:10:40,140
GO AHEAD AND WEAR
YOUR BUSINESS SUITS,

264
00:10:40,573 --> 00:10:43,168
SO YOU CAN MAKE $34,0000 A YEAR
AND BUY YOUR CONDOMINIUM.

265
00:10:43,168 --> 00:10:45,330
THEY'RE LIKE ZOMBIES,
RACING TO THEIR GRAVES.

266
00:10:45,764 --> 00:10:47,494
LOVE DIDN'T WORK FOR
MY MOM AND DAD,

267
00:10:47,494 --> 00:10:49,224
WHY SHOULD
IT WORK FOR ME ?

268
00:10:49,224 --> 00:10:51,818
MY DAD IS SUCH AN ASSHOLE,

269
00:10:51,818 --> 00:10:53,550
DRUNKEN BASTARD DOESN'T EVEN
KNOW I EXIST,

270
00:10:53,982 --> 00:10:55,712
BUT THEN HE WON'T LET ME
GO TO THE SKINNY PUPPY CONCERT

271
00:10:55,712 --> 00:10:57,875
BECAUSE MY HEROIN ADDICT AUNT
IS COMING OVER FOR DINNER.

272
00:10:58,308 --> 00:10:59,604
DINNER ?
THAT'S A LAUGH,

273
00:10:59,604 --> 00:11:01,335
JUST AN EXCUSE FOR MY MOM
TO BITCH AT ME

274
00:11:01,335 --> 00:11:02,634
FOR NOT WEARING GIRLY CLOTHES

275
00:11:02,634 --> 00:11:05,661
LIKE ALL THE BRITNEY SPEARS
WANNABES AT THIS SCHOOL.

276
00:11:05,661 --> 00:11:10,852
THEY'RE ALL A BUNCH OF
NAZI CONFORMIST CHEERLEADERS.

277
00:11:11,285 --> 00:11:14,311
BUT IF LIFE IS ONLY PAIN,

278
00:11:14,744 --> 00:11:16,043
THEN, WHAT'S THE POINT
OF LIVING ?

279
00:11:16,043 --> 00:11:19,071
JUST TO MAKE LIFE MORE
MISERABLE FOR THE CONFORMISTS.

280
00:11:19,071 --> 00:11:21,665
ALL RIGHT, SO HOW
DO I JOIN YOU ?

281
00:11:21,665 --> 00:11:23,829
IF YOU WANT TO BE ONE OF THE
NON-CONFORMISTS,

282
00:11:23,829 --> 00:11:25,559
ALL YOU HAVE TO DO
IS DRESS JUST LIKE US

283
00:11:25,559 --> 00:11:28,155
AND LISTEN TO THE SAME MUSIC
WE DO.

284
00:11:28,155 --> 00:11:29,885
'KAY.

285
00:11:34,211 --> 00:11:35,509
OKAY, I KNOW IT'S
YOUR FIRST DAY, FERRARI,

286
00:11:35,509 --> 00:11:36,806
SO I WANT TO GO OVER
THE BASICS WITH YOU.
OKAY.

287
00:11:36,806 --> 00:11:39,402
FIRST OF ALL,
THERE'S A FIVE-FOOT RULE:

288
00:11:39,402 --> 00:11:41,132
IF YOU COME WITHIN FIVE FEET
OF A CUSTOMER,

289
00:11:41,132 --> 00:11:41,997
YOU NEED TO ACKNOWLEDGE THEM,

290
00:11:42,429 --> 00:11:44,160
EVEN IF THEY'RE NOT AT
YOUR TABLE, "HEY, CUTIE !"

291
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:46,755
WHEN YOU'RE NOT SERVING FOOD
OR TALKING WITH CUSTOMERS,

292
00:11:46,755 --> 00:11:48,053
YOU NEED TO DANCE
AROUND AND HAVE FUN.

293
00:11:48,486 --> 00:11:50,649
WE HAVE THINGS LIKE HOOLA-HOOPS,
SILLY STRING AND WATER GUNS

294
00:11:50,649 --> 00:11:51,946
TO PLAY WITH THE OTHER GIRLS.

295
00:11:51,946 --> 00:11:54,109
BE SURE TO GIGGLE A LOT, AND BE
SURE TO SHOW OFF YOUR RAISINS.

296
00:11:54,109 --> 00:11:55,839
NOW, WHEN YOU TAKE
A CUSTOMER'S ORDER,

297
00:11:55,839 --> 00:11:57,137
YOU NEED TO SIT DOWN AT
THE TABLE WITH THEM.

298
00:11:57,569 --> 00:11:58,868
IT MAKES THEM
THINK YOU'RE INTERESTED.

299
00:11:58,868 --> 00:12:01,030
WRITE YOUR NAME DOWN FOR THEM,
AND MAKE THEM FEEL SPECIAL.

300
00:12:01,030 --> 00:12:04,057
"OH MAN, I AM SO BORED,
THANK GOD YOU GUYS CAME IN !"

301
00:12:04,057 --> 00:12:05,356
IF YOU WANT GOOD TIPS,

302
00:12:05,789 --> 00:12:07,086
THE MOST IMPORTANT THING
IS PHYSICAL CONTACT,

303
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:09,249
JUST A SIMPLE HOLD OF
THE ARM CAN BE THE DIFFERENCE

304
00:12:09,681 --> 00:12:11,412
BETWEEN $5 AND $20.

305
00:12:11,412 --> 00:12:14,008
"I'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH
YOUR ORDER, GUYS !"

306
00:12:14,008 --> 00:12:15,737
WOW, THANK YOU
SO MUCH, MERCEDES.

307
00:12:15,737 --> 00:12:18,333
OKAY, WELL I GUESS WE'RE READY
TO OPEN FOR BUSINESS, GOOD LUCK.

308
00:12:18,333 --> 00:12:20,929
GO AHEAD AND OPEN
FOR BUSINESS, PORSCHE.

309
00:12:20,929 --> 00:12:23,091
OKAY !

310
00:12:24,389 --> 00:12:26,119
HI, WELCOME TORAISINS !

00:12:30,877 --> 00:12:32,174
HOW'RE WE DOING TODAY ?!

314
00:12:32,607 --> 00:12:36,069
OH GOD, I MISSED YOU
SO MUCH.

315
00:12:36,069 --> 00:12:41,258
"SHALLOW LIFE,
DROWNING ALONE I GASP FOR AIR.

316
00:12:41,258 --> 00:12:43,422
"COLDNESS CREEPS OVER
PALE SKIN.

317
00:12:43,422 --> 00:12:46,017
"THERE IS SADNESS
SO DEEP IT PULLS ME DOWN.

318
00:12:46,017 --> 00:12:49,911
HAPPINESS DIES IN THE DEEP,
DARK SEA."

319
00:12:50,344 --> 00:12:52,505
YEAH, HAPPINESS DIES.

320
00:12:52,505 --> 00:12:54,235
YEAH.

321
00:12:54,668 --> 00:12:55,534
ALL RIGHT,
YOUR TURN, STAN.

322
00:12:55,965 --> 00:12:58,562
READ ONE OF YOUR POEMS
ABOUT PAIN.

323
00:12:58,562 --> 00:12:59,860
"THERE IS DARKNESS
ALL AROUND ME.

324
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:02,454
"DEEP, PIERCING
BLACK I CANNOT BREATHE.

325
00:13:02,454 --> 00:13:03,752
MY HEART HAS
BEEN RAPED."

326
00:13:03,752 --> 00:13:05,051
WHOA.

327
00:13:05,051 --> 00:13:07,213
"THE PAIN IS EVERLASTING,
I MISS YOU SO MUCH, BABE.

328
00:13:07,645 --> 00:13:09,375
WANT TO HOLD YOU
IN MY ARMS AGAIN, GIRL--"

329
00:13:09,375 --> 00:13:12,405
WHOA, WHOA, DUDE, THOSE LAST
TWO LINES AREN'T GOTH.

330
00:13:12,405 --> 00:13:13,702
THEY'RE NOT ?

331
00:13:13,702 --> 00:13:15,431
NO, DUDE, YOU CAN'T SAY,
"I MISS YOU SO MUCH, BABE.

332
00:13:15,431 --> 00:13:16,729
I WANT TO HOLD
YOU IN MY ARMS."

333
00:13:16,729 --> 00:13:19,326
MAKE IT, "I MISS SEEING YOU
SO MUCH, I WANT TO SLICE

334
00:13:19,758 --> 00:13:21,920
MY EYES OUT
WITH RAZOR BLADES."

335
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:24,082
HENRIETTA,
HI, SWEETIE !

336
00:13:24,082 --> 00:13:25,381
GO AWAY, MOM !

337
00:13:25,381 --> 00:13:27,977
DADDY AND I JUST GOT YOUR

BUT YOU CAN'T SEE
WHAT IT IS 'TIL TOMORROW !

339
00:13:30,571 --> 00:13:32,302
YOU'D LIKE TO WAIT 'TIL I WAS
DEAD, WOULDN'T YOU ?

340
00:13:32,302 --> 00:13:34,466
YOU'D LIKE TO SEE
THE MAGGOTS EAT MY FACE.

341
00:13:34,466 --> 00:13:36,196
YOU ARE SO CREATIVE,
HONEY !

342
00:13:36,196 --> 00:13:38,790
CONFORMIST BITCH.

346
00:13:47,442 --> 00:13:49,173
THANKS FOR CALLINGRAISINS,

347
00:13:49,173 --> 00:13:50,903

OUR DOUBLE WHAMMY WINGS ?

348
00:13:51,336 --> 00:13:53,497

351
00:13:58,257 --> 00:13:59,121

352
00:13:59,121 --> 00:14:01,283
HI, SWEETIE,

353
00:14:01,283 --> 00:14:03,447

00:14:05,610 --> 00:14:08,637
HEY, SWEETIE !
SO HOW ARE YOU, HONEY ?

356
00:14:08,637 --> 00:14:10,801
I'M FINE,
I MISS YOU, THOUGH.

357
00:14:10,801 --> 00:14:13,397
YEAH, SCHOOL WAS PRETTY
TOUGH TODAY.

358
00:14:13,828 --> 00:14:15,990
WE HAD TWO QUIZZES
AND ONE OF THEM WAS A POP QUIZ.

359
00:14:15,990 --> 00:14:18,587
Sometimes I think our classes
are too hard.

360
00:14:18,587 --> 00:14:20,750
BUT I THOUGHT ABOUT
YOU ALL DAY LONG, I PROMISE !

361
00:14:21,183 --> 00:14:22,048
SO HOW IS YOUR
DAY GOING ?

362
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:23,777
GOOD, GOOD.

363
00:14:23,777 --> 00:14:25,508
HEY, HEY, SWEETIE, I WAS
THINKING TONIGHT YOU COULD

364
00:14:25,941 --> 00:14:28,537
COME OVER AND WE COULD WATCH
"THE EXORCIST" ON D.V.D. !

365
00:14:28,537 --> 00:14:30,699
OH, GEE,
I DON'T KNOW, CUTIE.

366
00:14:30,699 --> 00:14:32,429
WHY DON'T YOU JUST COME DOWN
TORAISINS.

367
00:14:32,429 --> 00:14:35,457
WELL, I KIND OF
DON'T HAVE ANY MONEY LEFT.

368
00:14:35,890 --> 00:14:38,052
I SPENT IT ALL ATRAISINS
THE LAST SIX TIMES.

369
00:14:38,052 --> 00:14:41,081
OOH, THAT'S TOO BAD, CUTIE,
I REALLY WANT TO SEE YOU !

370
00:14:41,514 --> 00:14:43,244
OH, I REALLY WANT TO SEE
YOU TOO, BABY !

371
00:14:43,676 --> 00:14:45,406
DON'T WORRY,
I'LL GET MORE MONEY !

372
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:47,137
'KAY, TIGGERS, GOTTA RUN !

373
00:14:47,569 --> 00:14:48,867
OKAY,
UH, HEY, LEXUS...

374
00:14:48,867 --> 00:14:51,895
WELL, THERE'S SOMETHING I'VE
BEEN MEANING TO SAY...

375
00:14:51,895 --> 00:14:54,922
HERE IT GOES...

376
00:14:54,922 --> 00:14:57,518
LEXUS, I... OH GEEZ, MAYBE I
SHOULDN'T SAY IT...

377
00:14:57,951 --> 00:14:59,248

HEE HEE !

380
00:15:03,574 --> 00:15:06,169
DAD, I NEED AN ADVANCE
ON MY ALLOWANCE AGAIN.

381
00:15:06,602 --> 00:15:09,198
OH, NO, BUTTERS, YOU GOT

382
00:15:09,198 --> 00:15:10,495
BUT I SPENT IT ALL !

383
00:15:10,495 --> 00:15:12,658
WHAT ARE YOU SPENDING ALL
THAT MONEY ON, BUTTERS ?

384
00:15:12,658 --> 00:15:13,956
ON MY GIRLFRIEND !

385
00:15:13,956 --> 00:15:15,253
GIRLFRIEND ?!

386
00:15:15,253 --> 00:15:17,416
YOU HAVE A GIRLFRIEND,
BUTTERS ?

387
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:18,713
YEAH...

388
00:15:19,146 --> 00:15:21,742
AND SHE'S A GIRL,

389
00:15:21,742 --> 00:15:23,039

WELL, ALL RIGHT !

391
00:15:24,770 --> 00:15:26,068
OH, THAT IS SO CUTE !

392
00:15:26,068 --> 00:15:27,365
WHEN DO WE GET
TO MEET HER ?

393
00:15:27,798 --> 00:15:29,528
WELL, I WAS HOPING TO GO SEE HER
RIGHT NOW, YOU CAN COME ALONG,

394
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:31,260
BUT DON'T
EMBARRASS ME OR NOTHING,

395
00:15:31,690 --> 00:15:33,422
I'M SURE SHE'LL BE REAL NERVOUS
TO IMPRESS YOU.

396
00:15:33,422 --> 00:15:34,719
DON'T WORRY, BUTTERS,

397
00:15:35,152 --> 00:15:36,882
WE JUST WANT TO SAY HI AND THEN
WE'LL LEAVE YOU TWO ALONE !

401
00:15:49,426 --> 00:15:51,589
HEY, CAN WE GET MORE COFFEE

402
00:15:51,589 --> 00:15:53,320

403
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:55,050
AND DRINK $6 WORTH OF
COFFEE ?

404
00:15:55,050 --> 00:15:56,347
WHY DON'T YOU GET A LIFE ?!

405
00:15:56,347 --> 00:16:00,674
CONFORMIST,
HAVE FUN IN YOUR RAT RACE LIFE,

406
00:16:00,674 --> 00:16:02,403
LIVING PAYCHECK TO PAYCHECK

DUDE, YOU HAVEN'T
DRANK YOUR COFFEE.

409
00:16:05,864 --> 00:16:07,162
WELL, I DON'T
DRINK COFFEE.

410
00:16:07,162 --> 00:16:10,621
YOU CAN'T BE A NON-CONFORMIST
IF YOU DON'T DRINK COFFEE.

411
00:16:14,083 --> 00:16:15,814
OH, JESUS CHRIST.
I HAD TO SEE IT TO BELIEVE IT.

412
00:16:15,814 --> 00:16:17,111
WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING ?

413
00:16:17,543 --> 00:16:20,571
I'M BREATHING DEEP THE DARKNESS
THAT ENVELOPES MY SOUL.

414
00:16:20,571 --> 00:16:24,032
GOD DAMN IT, DUDE, YOUR MOM
AND DAD WANT YOU TO COME HOME !

415
00:16:24,032 --> 00:16:26,194
SO THEY CAN FILL MY HEAD
WITH MOREDISNEYLIES

416
00:16:26,194 --> 00:16:27,492
ABOUT HOW
PERFECT THE WORLD IS ?

417
00:16:27,492 --> 00:16:28,790
I DON'T THINK SO.

418
00:16:28,790 --> 00:16:30,521
YEAH, WHY DON'T YOU JUST GO BACK
TO YOUR JUSTIN TIMBERLAKE

419
00:16:30,521 --> 00:16:32,251
AND YOUR HOMEWORK,
YOU CONFORMIST ASSHOLE.

420
00:16:32,683 --> 00:16:33,981
YOU JUST DON'T KNOW WHAT
REAL PAIN IS.

421
00:16:34,413 --> 00:16:35,711
OH, LIKE YOU
KNOW WHAT PAIN IS !

422
00:16:35,711 --> 00:16:37,442
GO TRY LIVING IN A THIRD WORLD
COUNTRY, YOU LITTLE PUSSY !

423
00:16:37,875 --> 00:16:39,172
I'M NOT GONNA LIVE
IN A THIRD WORLD COUNTRY

424
00:16:39,172 --> 00:16:40,469
WITH ALL THE CONFORMISTS !

425
00:16:40,469 --> 00:16:42,199
STAN, THIS IS IT, TIME TO STOP
FEELING SORRY FOR YOURSELF,

426
00:16:42,632 --> 00:16:43,497
AND COME HOME.

427
00:16:43,931 --> 00:16:45,228
EVERYONE CARES ABOUT YOU
AND EVERYONE WANTS YOU BACK.

428
00:16:45,228 --> 00:16:46,959
WHAT ABOUT WENDY ?
IS SHE STILL WITH TOKEN ?

429
00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:48,255
YEAH, SHE IS.

430
00:16:48,255 --> 00:16:49,985
THEN, PEOPLE SHOULDN'T
CARE ABOUT ME,

431
00:16:49,985 --> 00:16:51,716
'CAUSE I DON'T
CARE ABOUT THEM.

432
00:16:51,716 --> 00:16:53,879
WHAT'S THE POINT OF CARING
WHEN ALL IT BRINGS IS PAIN ?

433
00:16:54,312 --> 00:16:55,176
FOR SURE.

434
00:16:55,609 --> 00:16:58,204
FINE, THAT'S IT, I GIVE UP,
HAVE FUN BEING MISERABLE.

435
00:16:58,638 --> 00:16:59,503
CONFORMIST.

436
00:16:59,503 --> 00:17:01,666

00:17:41,562 --> 00:17:42,860
LIKE HIM FOR MONEY.

455
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:45,887
THIS PLACE IS HORRIBLE,
TO OBJECTIFY GIRLS LIKE THIS !

456
00:17:45,887 --> 00:17:48,050
HI GUYS, CAN I TAKE
YOUR ORDER ?

457
00:17:48,050 --> 00:17:49,780
LITTLE GIRL,
YOU SHOULDN'T BE WORKING HERE.

458
00:17:49,780 --> 00:17:51,078
I SHOULDN'T ?!

459
00:17:51,078 --> 00:17:52,375
WHERE AM I SUPPOSED
TO BE WORKING ?!

460
00:17:52,809 --> 00:17:54,971
NO, I MEAN YOU SHOULDN'T WORK
SOMEWHERE WHERE YOU'RE PAID

461
00:17:54,971 --> 00:17:57,567
FOR HOW YOU LOOK,
YOU SHOULD BE LEARNING A SKILL,

462
00:17:57,567 --> 00:17:59,297
SO YOU CAN GROW UP TO BE
A BUSINESS WOMAN

463
00:17:59,297 --> 00:18:00,163
OR EVEN A DOCTOR.

464
00:18:00,163 --> 00:18:02,325
WHO KNOWS,
YOU COULD CURE CANCER !

465
00:18:02,325 --> 00:18:03,190
I COULD CURE CANCER ?!

466
00:18:03,623 --> 00:18:05,353
OH MY GOD,
THAT WOULD BE SO COOL !

467
00:18:05,353 --> 00:18:07,082
I HAD A CANCER SORE
ON MY LIP ONCE,

468
00:18:07,516 --> 00:18:08,814
AND IT HURT SO BAD !

469
00:18:08,814 --> 00:18:12,707
OH, NEVERMIND, I THINKRAISINS
MIGHT BE THE PERFECT PLACE

470
00:18:12,707 --> 00:18:14,004
FOR YOU.

471
00:18:14,437 --> 00:18:17,897

00:18:19,628 --> 00:18:23,088

A LITTLE TALK WITH YOU ?

474
00:18:23,088 --> 00:18:24,385
OUTSIDE.

475
00:18:24,385 --> 00:18:26,117
HUH, OH, ANYTHING

476
00:18:26,117 --> 00:18:27,847

477
00:18:27,847 --> 00:18:31,307
BUTTERS, THESE GIRLS PRETEND
TO BE INTERESTED IN YOU

478
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:33,470
BECAUSE THEY KNOW
YOU'LL GIVE THEM TIPS.

479
00:18:33,470 --> 00:18:34,335
HUH ?

480
00:18:34,768 --> 00:18:36,932
YOU SEE, BUTTERS, WOMEN KNOW
THAT THEY CAN MAKE MEN DO

481
00:18:36,932 --> 00:18:38,661
ANYTHING BY FLIRTING.

482
00:18:38,661 --> 00:18:42,121
AND SOME GIRLS, LIKE THESE,
TURN THAT INTO A PROFESSION.

483
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:46,014
OH I SEE, YOU DON'T APPROVE
OF MY GIRLFRIEND !

484
00:18:46,014 --> 00:18:47,745
WELL, LET ME TELL YOU

00:18:47,745 --> 00:18:49,475
OUR LOVE IS AS PURE AS
A MOUNTAIN SPRING !

486
00:18:49,908 --> 00:18:51,206
THE ODDS MAY BE
STACKED AGAINST US,

487
00:18:51,206 --> 00:18:52,502
BUT WE'RE GONNA GIVE IT
OUR BEST SHOT !

488
00:18:52,935 --> 00:18:54,233
AND SO IF YOU
CAN'T BE HAPPY FOR US,

489
00:18:54,233 --> 00:18:57,261
YOU CAN JUST GO TO HECK,
MOM AND DAD !

490
00:18:57,261 --> 00:18:58,126

497
00:19:11,968 --> 00:19:12,833

500
00:19:18,889 --> 00:19:21,918
WELL, GO AHEAD AND GO.

501
00:19:21,918 --> 00:19:24,080
IT'S BEST WE DON'T SAY
ANYTHING MORE.

502
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:25,810
THERE'S NOTHING LEFT TO SAY...

503
00:19:26,243 --> 00:19:29,704
IT'S OVER...
OUR RELATIONSHIP IS OVER...

504
00:19:29,704 --> 00:19:34,894
♪ I'M ALL OUT OF LOVE
I'M SO LOST WITHOUT YOU... ♪

505
00:19:34,894 --> 00:19:39,220
( sobbing )

506
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:41,816
♪ I'M ALL OUT OF LOVE ♪♪

507
00:19:42,247 --> 00:19:43,980
( boy )
LOOK AT THAT,
ANOTHER TORTURED SOUL.

508
00:19:44,411 --> 00:19:45,709
ANOTHER LIFE OF PAIN.

509
00:19:46,141 --> 00:19:49,602
HEY, RAVEN,
CHECK IT OUT.

510
00:19:49,602 --> 00:19:51,333
BUTTERS ?

511
00:19:51,333 --> 00:19:53,494
OH, OH, HEY, STAN.

512
00:19:53,494 --> 00:19:55,224
WHAT'S THE MATTER
WITH YOU ?

513
00:19:55,224 --> 00:19:59,119
WELL... MY-- MY GIRLFRIEND
BROKE UP WITH ME.

514
00:19:59,119 --> 00:20:02,146
DID SHE STEP ON YOUR
HEART WITH STILETTO SHOES ?

515
00:20:02,146 --> 00:20:05,175
YEAH,
IT SURE DOES HURT.

516
00:20:05,175 --> 00:20:07,771
THAT'S COOL, I GUESS YOU CAN
JOIN UP WITH US IF YOU WANT.

517
00:20:07,771 --> 00:20:09,500
YEAH, WE'RE GONNA GO TO
THE GRAVEYARD AND WRITE POEMS

518
00:20:09,933 --> 00:20:12,096
ABOUT DEATH AND HOW
POINTLESS LIFE IS.

519
00:20:12,096 --> 00:20:15,124
OH, NO, THANKS,
I LOVE LIFE.

520
00:20:15,124 --> 00:20:17,718
HUH ?  BUT YOU
JUST GOT DUMPED.

521
00:20:17,718 --> 00:20:19,017
WELL, YEAH, AND I'M SAD.

522
00:20:19,017 --> 00:20:21,179
BUT AT THE SAME TIME,
I'M REALLY HAPPY THAT SOMETHING

523
00:20:21,179 --> 00:20:23,342
CAN MAKE ME FEEL
THAT SAD.

524
00:20:23,342 --> 00:20:26,371
IT'S LIKE... IT MAKES
ME FEEL ALIVE, YOU KNOW ?

525
00:20:26,371 --> 00:20:28,101
IT MAKES ME FEEL HUMAN.

526
00:20:28,101 --> 00:20:30,696
THE ONLY WAY I COULD FEEL THIS
SAD NOW IS IF I FELT SOMETHING

527
00:20:30,696 --> 00:20:31,993
REALLY GOOD BEFORE,

528
00:20:32,425 --> 00:20:34,156
SO I HAVE TO TAKE
THE BAD WITH THE GOOD,

529
00:20:34,156 --> 00:20:37,185
SO I GUESS WHAT I'M FEELING
IS LIKE A 'BEAUTIFUL SADNESS'...

530
00:20:37,185 --> 00:20:38,914
I GUESS THAT
SOUNDS STUPID.

531
00:20:38,914 --> 00:20:40,212
YEAH.

532
00:20:40,644 --> 00:20:43,241
NO, NO, BUTTERS, THAT DOESN'T
SOUND STUPID AT ALL.

533
00:20:43,241 --> 00:20:45,403
BUT THANKS FOR OFFERING
TO LET ME IN YOUR CLIQUE, GUYS,

534
00:20:45,403 --> 00:20:47,998
BUT TO BE HONEST, I'D RATHER
BE A CRYING, LITTLE PUSSY

535
00:20:47,998 --> 00:20:51,459
THAN A FAGGY GOTH KID,
WELL, SEE YA, STAN.

536
00:20:51,459 --> 00:20:55,352
HE'S RIGHT, I DON'T
EVEN KNOW WHO I AM ANYMORE.

537
00:20:55,352 --> 00:20:57,083
I LIKE LIKING LIFE A LOT
MORE THAN HATING IT.

538
00:20:57,516 --> 00:21:00,110
SCREW YOU, GUYS,
I'M GOING HOME.

539
00:21:01,841 --> 00:21:04,869
GO AHEAD AND GO BACK TO
YOUR SUNSHINE FAIRY TALE !

540
00:21:09,626 --> 00:21:10,493
OKAY, IT'S THIRD DOWN !

542
00:21:12,656 --> 00:21:13,520
HEY, CAN
I JOIN IN ?

543
00:21:13,953 --> 00:21:16,116
WHAT HAPPENED, AREN'T YOU
STILL WALLOWING IN PAIN ?

544
00:21:16,116 --> 00:21:19,144
YEAH, IT STILL HURTS A LOT,
BUT I JUST REALIZED THAT

545
00:21:19,144 --> 00:21:20,874
THERE'S GOING TO BE A LOT
OF PAINFUL TIMES IN LIFE,

546
00:21:20,874 --> 00:21:24,767
SO I BETTER LEARN TO DEAL
WITH IT THE RIGHT WAY.

547
00:21:24,767 --> 00:21:26,497
HEY, WENDY !

548
00:21:26,930 --> 00:21:28,227

OH, DUDE, IT'S GOOD

552
00:21:35,581 --> 00:21:37,311
YEAH, LET'S PLAY BALL.
