1
00:00:36,072 --> 00:00:38,841
And in conclusion, the Latino community
has provided America,

2
00:00:38,842 --> 00:00:47,079
and indeed, the entire world with innovations
that we would be lost without.

3
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:46,417
And that is my presentation on the role of
Hispanics in American technology. Thank you.

4
00:00:49,021 --> 00:00:50,829
Okay, thank you, Kyle Broflovski.

5
00:00:50,852 --> 00:00:52,266
That was very good, Kyle.

6
00:00:52,267 --> 00:00:57,172
I think the Latino Endowment Council
was very happy with your presentation.
Looks like you might win.

7
00:00:57,173 --> 00:00:59,480
-Cool.
-All right, students, members of the school board.

8
00:00:59,481 --> 00:01:03,312
Our last speaker will discuss the important role of Latinos in the arts.

9
00:01:04,121 --> 00:01:06,615
Here is... Eric Cartman. Eric Cartman?

10
00:01:09,271 --> 00:01:13,384
Thank you. The Latino culture has been very influential on the arts in America.

12
00:01:18,527 --> 00:01:20,296
-Jennifer Lopez?
-No way.

13
00:01:25,313 --> 00:01:26,831
Miss Lopez, come on out here.

14
00:01:22,816 --> 00:01:23,815
Hallooo.

15
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,960
Oh, Jesus Christ.

16
00:01:26,056 --> 00:01:29,700
My name is Hennifer Lopez. I eat tacos, y burritos.

17
00:01:30,016 --> 00:01:32,306
Ms. Lopez, would you like to talk about Lations and the arts?

18
00:01:32,328 --> 00:01:35,908
Oh sí, sí. But first I would like to put on my pretty dress.

19
00:01:36,663 --> 00:01:37,499
Oh, you mean this one?

20
00:01:37,662 --> 00:01:40,241
Oh sí sí sí. I like it very much.

21
00:01:45,388 --> 00:01:47,148
-There we go, Saright?
-Saright.

22
00:01:47,149 --> 00:01:48,137
That's a very pretty dress.

23
00:01:48,363 --> 00:01:50,597
It better be! I am Hennifer Lopez!

24
00:01:50,878 --> 00:01:52,670
Nonono, you're Jennifer Lopez

25
00:01:52,861 --> 00:01:54,525
Sí sí. Hennifer Lopez!

26
00:01:54,843 --> 00:01:56,081
-Nono, Jeh-
-Heh-

27
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:57,367
Jeh-
Heh-

28
00:01:58,632 --> 00:02:00,505
-Jennifer Lopez
-Hennifer Lopez

29
00:02:05,008 --> 00:02:08,040
Ms. Lopez, could you show everyone your example of Latino arts?

30
00:02:08,829 --> 00:02:11,853
Don't be fooled by all my money. I still like to eat tacos, honey.

31
00:02:12,229 --> 00:02:15,630
So crispy on the outside, so super good and yummy.

32
00:02:16,039 --> 00:02:19,482
And that is my presentation on Latinos in the arts. Thank you.

33
00:02:28,885 --> 00:02:32,185
Oh-hoh man! A twenty-dollar gift certificate at the mall!

34
00:02:32,450 --> 00:02:35,723
I can buy whatever I want! Cultural Diversity Day kicks ass!

35
00:02:35,982 --> 00:02:38,853
It isn't fair. I spent weeks preparing my speech on Latino culture.

36
00:02:39,177 --> 00:02:40,787
Hey, I spent weeks preparing too, Kyle.

37
00:02:40,788 --> 00:02:43,736
No you didn't, asshole! What you did was totally stupid and racist!

38
00:02:43,901 --> 00:02:45,637
And you only did it to screw me over!

39
00:02:45,638 --> 00:02:47,944
Awww, I don't think Kyle likes you, Ms. Lopez.

40
00:02:48,402 --> 00:02:50,244
Aww, that makes me muy triste.

41
00:02:50,505 --> 00:02:51,697
Ms. Lopez, do you like Kyle?

42
00:02:51,944 --> 00:02:53,226
Oh sí sí, very much.

43
00:02:53,515 --> 00:02:55,402
Ms. Lopez, would you like to give Kyle a kiss?

44
00:02:55,699 --> 00:02:58,645
Oh sí, sí sí, my kisses taste like tacos.

45
00:03:00,845 --> 00:03:01,550
Is nice?

46
00:03:01,559 --> 00:03:03,990
Is bery nice. He's so hansome.

47
00:03:05,672 --> 00:03:06,428
Stop it!

48
00:03:06,476 --> 00:03:09,783
Hey, come one guys! We can use part of my gift certificate to buy food at the food court.

49
00:03:13,185 --> 00:03:15,180
Mmm, tacos! So yummy!

50
00:03:15,391 --> 00:03:17,354
Stop wasting the tacos on your hand, Cartman!

51
00:03:17,436 --> 00:03:18,931
Hey, Ms. Lopez has to eat, too.

52
00:03:19,096 --> 00:03:20,958
She's not eating it, it's just comint out her backside!

53
00:03:21,294 --> 00:03:24,091
When you eat a taco it comes out your backside too, cholo!

54
00:03:25,431 --> 00:03:27,519
Look look! Make your own music video!

55
00:03:27,903 --> 00:03:30,393
Nonono, we're not going into one of those cheesy places, Cartman!

56
00:03:30,472 --> 00:03:31,949
I agree. Those places are stupid.

57
00:03:32,039 --> 00:03:34,296
It's not stupid. I need to make music video.

58
00:03:34,779 --> 00:03:36,152
Look, we're not going in there, so just-!

59
00:03:36,153 --> 00:03:37,803
Wait, why the hell am I talking to your hand?

60
00:03:37,804 --> 00:03:39,207
Look, we're not going in there, so just knock it off!

61
00:03:39,494 --> 00:03:40,825
Hey, I'm on your guys's side.

62
00:03:40,825 --> 00:03:42,620
Just wait one minute, let me see how much it is.

63
00:03:43,502 --> 00:03:44,363
God damnit!

64
00:03:45,838 --> 00:03:48,245
Welcome to Make Your Own Video. All set to rock and roll?

65
00:03:48,468 --> 00:03:49,757
How much to make a video?

66
00:03:50,497 --> 00:03:53,211
Uh, well, it's nine ninety five for a three-minute tape.

67
00:03:53,212 --> 00:03:55,245
Heh! We're not paying nine ninety five!

68
00:03:55,246 --> 00:03:56,476
Oh please! Come on, guys!

69
00:03:56,824 --> 00:03:58,220
Cartman, will you stop this gayness?!

70
00:03:58,456 --> 00:03:59,874
All right all right, here's ten dollars!

71
00:04:00,402 --> 00:04:01,631
That's not what I meant!

72
00:04:01,706 --> 00:04:04,095
All right, just come over here and stand in front of the green screen.

73
00:04:05,271 --> 00:04:06,528
What kind of song do you want?

74
00:04:06,611 --> 00:04:08,346
Something warm and spicy.

75
00:04:10,513 --> 00:04:11,185
Spicier.

76
00:04:13,473 --> 00:04:14,556
Spicierrr!

77
00:04:17,377 --> 00:04:21,575
Burrito. Taco taco. Burrito. Taco. Taco taco.

78
00:04:22,003 --> 00:04:22,732
Don't think that just because I got a lot of money

79
00:04:22,996 --> 00:04:24,533
I'll give you taco-flavored kisses, honey!

80
00:04:24,810 --> 00:04:28,263
Fulfill all your wishes with my taco-flavored kisses.

81
00:04:28,531 --> 00:04:31,649
Taco taco. Burrito Burri...to. Taco taco.

82
00:04:31,822 --> 00:04:35,319
You know, I've seen a lot of videos here at the mall, and that was by far the best!

83
00:04:35,571 --> 00:04:37,219
"Oh, gracias, ""Machél""!"

84
00:04:37,223 --> 00:04:40,498
Hey, I've got a friend who's interning at a big record label in L.A.

85
00:04:40,673 --> 00:04:43,410
I'll send a copy on to him and maybe he'll get the bigwigs to see ya.

86
00:04:43,487 --> 00:04:46,033
Oh, gracias, Machel, gracias!

87
00:04:46,033 --> 00:04:47,076
Can we go now, please?!

88
00:04:47,209 --> 00:04:47,974
Yeah, I wanna leave.

89
00:04:48,019 --> 00:04:49,760
-Stop it, Cartman!
-What?

90
00:04:51,532 --> 00:04:55,093
Fulfill all your wishes with my taco-flavored kisses.

91
00:04:56,901 --> 00:04:57,994
She's fantiastic. Who is she?

92
00:04:58,295 --> 00:05:00,816
Believe it or not, her name is Jennifer Lopez

93
00:05:01,103 --> 00:05:02,940
That makes sense. She reminds me of J-Lo.

94
00:05:03,098 --> 00:05:04,914
Yeah, but she's younger and spicier.

95
00:05:06,255 --> 00:05:08,815
Taco taco. Burrito Burri...to. Taco taco.

96
00:05:09,113 --> 00:05:11,905
I don't think J-Lo would like it very much if we signed this new girl.

97
00:05:12,191 --> 00:05:15,408
No, you're right. We're gonna have to fire J-Lo.

98
00:05:21,178 --> 00:05:24,203
Hello? ...BHI records?

99
00:05:26,075 --> 00:05:27,736
...Oh, it's for you, Ms. Lopez.

100
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:29,635
Oh, sí sí sííí. Allo!

101
00:05:29,814 --> 00:05:31,874
-What do they want?
-Just a second, I'm trying to hear.

102
00:05:31,875 --> 00:05:32,769
-S'awright?
-S'awright.

103
00:05:32,792 --> 00:05:35,810
Yes yes, this is Ms. Hrrrlopez. Uh huh.

104
00:05:39,261 --> 00:05:40,258
What? What?

105
00:05:40,259 --> 00:05:41,767
Oh my God I can't believe it!!!

106
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:42,802
Hello hello, are you still there?

107
00:05:42,803 --> 00:05:45,314
They want to sign me to the rrrecord companyyy!

108
00:05:45,315 --> 00:05:46,389
You want to sign Ms. Lopez?

109
00:05:46,390 --> 00:05:47,816
Oh my God, it's happening for me!

110
00:05:47,887 --> 00:05:49,848
Yes! Yes, we can record an album next week!

111
00:05:50,337 --> 00:05:52,942
Sure we can write ten songs! We'll start tonight!!

112
00:05:53,564 --> 00:05:55,974
-We're gonna be rich!
-We're gonna be famose!

113
00:05:56,070 --> 00:05:57,393
Come on, we gotta get to work on some songs!

114
00:06:01,844 --> 00:06:04,019
There. That's three more songs we've written already!

115
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:07,541
Your style of music is so easy it doesn't require any thought at all!

116
00:06:07,696 --> 00:06:09,131
Oh, sí sí sííí.

117
00:06:11,092 --> 00:06:12,711
Okay, Ms. Lopez, time to go to sleep.

118
00:06:16,836 --> 00:06:18,080
Ohh, I'm so sleeeepyyy.

119
00:06:18,439 --> 00:06:21,463
"Good night, Ms. Lopez. Tomorrow is gonna be a great day.

120
00:06:22,575 --> 00:06:25,697
Great day tomorrow... Tomorrow...

121
00:06:27,176 --> 00:06:29,934
Kyle, you were wrong! We did do a record deal!

122
00:06:30,623 --> 00:06:32,185
You were wrong, Kyle!

123
00:06:42,477 --> 00:06:45,641
Awesommme. Yeeessss."

124
00:06:52,854 --> 00:06:56,006
-Ms. Lopez! Up here!
-Jennifer, We love you Jennifer!

125
00:06:58,998 --> 00:07:00,607
We love you Jennifer!

126
00:07:11,248 --> 00:07:12,636
Ah, Ms. Lopez, come on in.

127
00:07:14,353 --> 00:07:18,068
Yo, make it quick. I got a video shoot at two and a script reading at five.

128
00:07:18,888 --> 00:07:24,676
Yes, well uh, Ms. Lopes, we regret to inform you that, uh... we're dropping you from the label.

129
00:07:25,441 --> 00:07:27,863
What? Oh no you di'n't!

130
00:07:28,056 --> 00:07:32,000
We wanna thank you for all your hard work and ..."talent".

131
00:07:32,123 --> 00:07:36,383
You can't drop me! I'm Jennifer Lopez! How can you drop me?!

132
00:07:37,071 --> 00:07:40,812
Wu-well a very talented younger singer has come to our attention and,

133
00:07:41,094 --> 00:07:44,724
and the truth of the matter is her name happens to be Jennifer Lopez as well.

134
00:07:45,053 --> 00:07:47,947
And we really can't have two here at BHI Records.

135
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:52,922
Who the hell is this other Jennifer Lopez?! Where 'os she come from?!

136
00:07:53,121 --> 00:07:58,153
Well, she lives in South Park, Colorado now, but uh I believe she originally from Mexico, just like you.

137
00:07:58,429 --> 00:08:01,731
I don't come from no Mexico! I'm Puer'ah Rican!

138
00:08:01,732 --> 00:08:05,035
Whatever. Look, it's nothing persona, we just think you need to move on.

139
00:08:05,373 --> 00:08:08,700
Bu- AND you're a mean-spirited bitch who spits on people who aren't rich and famous.

140
00:08:09,349 --> 00:08:12,234
And sources say that the new film will star Ben Affleck.

141
00:08:12,834 --> 00:08:16,155
Huhuhuh, that's me. How'd it go, baby?

142
00:08:16,324 --> 00:08:20,987
Terrible, Ben! Some girl in Colorado is trying to become the new Jennifer Lopez!

143
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:23,470
Shut up!

144
00:08:23,897 --> 00:08:25,766
What?? Who could replace you??

145
00:08:26,115 --> 00:08:28,819
Yo driver. Stupid driver!

146
00:08:29,102 --> 00:08:30,384
Yes, ma'am. Where to?

147
00:08:30,402 --> 00:08:34,340
Take me to South Park, Colorado! I'm gonna kill that bitch!!

148
00:08:40,686 --> 00:08:43,461
Hay everybody! Listen up! I've got somethng to tell Kyle!

149
00:08:44,772 --> 00:08:45,584
...What?

150
00:08:53,328 --> 00:08:55,017
What are you gloating about?

151
00:08:55,018 --> 00:08:58,103
Oh, I'm not gloating. I just got a little call from a recond company in Los Angeles and,

152
00:08:58,183 --> 00:09:00,909
they want Ms. Lopez to recored an album next week.

153
00:09:01,027 --> 00:09:02,386
Wow, really?

154
00:09:02,695 --> 00:09:03,244
No!

155
00:09:03,245 --> 00:09:05,765
Yup, looks like I'm gonna be rich. And famous.

156
00:09:05,835 --> 00:09:10,352
Olay, children, let's take our seats. If you'll remember yesterday we were discussing state capitals.

157
00:09:10,670 --> 00:09:13,741
Hey, a big limosine just pulled up in front of the school!

158
00:09:13,742 --> 00:09:15,269
Butters, will you pay attention, please?

159
00:09:15,579 --> 00:09:17,937
Holy smokes, it's Jennifer Lopez!

160
00:09:18,378 --> 00:09:19,362
Jennifer Lopez?

161
00:09:19,395 --> 00:09:20,118
Yes?

162
00:09:20,119 --> 00:09:22,296
Holy geez wow! There's Ben Affleck, too!

163
00:09:22,657 --> 00:09:23,665
Wow, cool!

164
00:09:23,666 --> 00:09:26,672
Will you kids shut up? Jennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck are not-!

165
00:09:26,673 --> 00:09:29,356
Oh my God, that's Jennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck.

166
00:09:31,099 --> 00:09:32,839
Oh Jesus, will you look at those boots?

167
00:09:33,601 --> 00:09:35,603
Well what are we waiting for? Let's get outside!

168
00:09:38,465 --> 00:09:40,239
Is it true? Jennifer Lopez is here?

169
00:09:40,246 --> 00:09:41,588
Here she comes! Here she comes!

170
00:09:41,876 --> 00:09:47,621
Okay! What smart-mouthed little punk-ass bitch has been saying they're the new Jennifer Lopez, huh?!

171
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:50,495
J-Lo, can we get a picture of you with the kids?

172
00:09:50,666 --> 00:09:51,835
No! Shut up!

173
00:09:52,185 --> 00:09:55,266
If I find the ho who thinks she's taken my career from me,

174
00:09:55,412 --> 00:09:57,603
I'm gonna wring her pretty little neck!

175
00:09:59,286 --> 00:10:02,140
So, nobody want's to fess up, huh? Too scared to talk?!

176
00:10:02,436 --> 00:10:07,753
You'd better remember, bitch, that I'll come and take you down if you ever say anythin' again!

177
00:10:09,544 --> 00:10:12,009
You can suck my culo, chica!

178
00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:18,376
Who was that?! You go' a problem?!

179
00:10:19,059 --> 00:10:21,083
-Not me!
-Then who?

180
00:10:23,656 --> 00:10:24,958
Hola, bitchola!

181
00:10:25,728 --> 00:10:27,112
What the hell is that?!

182
00:10:27,315 --> 00:10:31,428
My name is Hennifer Hlopez! And I like tacos, and burritos.

183
00:10:31,803 --> 00:10:33,368
That? That's what replaced me?!

184
00:10:34,148 --> 00:10:35,466
I'm sure it was just a mistake.

185
00:10:35,467 --> 00:10:38,391
Only mistake was when this ghetto trash got signed in the first place!

186
00:10:38,392 --> 00:10:39,463
Shut your God-damned mouth!

187
00:10:39,539 --> 00:10:41,736
You fucking smartass, who do you think you are?!

188
00:10:42,091 --> 00:10:42,586
Nobody

189
00:10:42,587 --> 00:10:46,133
I am Yennifer Hrlopez! I eat tacos, and burritos!

190
00:10:46,495 --> 00:10:47,231
Fuck you!

191
00:10:48,364 --> 00:10:50,770
Yaaaaah! Wait! I'm sorry! Ah I'll stop! I'll stop!

192
00:10:50,898 --> 00:10:52,941
-You'd better stop!
-I will

193
00:10:52,943 --> 00:10:54,083
Come on, Jenny, let's go

194
00:10:54,372 --> 00:10:55,620
Wow, Ben Affleck.

195
00:11:10,191 --> 00:11:13,736
Don' you forget what'll happen to you, ho! Come on, Benny!

196
00:11:22,121 --> 00:11:24,365
Well, there you go, fatass! I hope you learned your lesson.

197
00:11:24,446 --> 00:11:26,997
Yeah. I sure did. I don't think I should record that album now.

198
00:11:27,416 --> 00:11:28,223
Good.

199
00:11:28,224 --> 00:11:29,547
Or maybe I shou-ould.

200
00:11:30,019 --> 00:11:30,849
Aw, God-damnit!

201
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:32,393
Ohnonono, Ms. Lopez.

202
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:33,764
Ohsísísí, señor.

203
00:11:34,088 --> 00:11:35,525
That does it. I'm out.

204
00:11:35,891 --> 00:11:38,563
Oh, where are you going, Kyle? Come give me kisses!

205
00:11:40,671 --> 00:11:42,728
All right, Ms. Lopez, take it from the top.

206
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:46,277
Baby let's make a run for the border,

207
00:11:46,674 --> 00:11:48,128
I've got a hunger only tacos can stop.

208
00:11:48,533 --> 00:11:50,093
I know exactly what I ordered

209
00:11:50,094 --> 00:11:51,909
Three tacos two tostadas and a soda pop.

210
00:11:52,929 --> 00:11:55,220
Gentlemen, we have ourselves a hit.

211
00:11:56,207 --> 00:11:57,822
I need to make a run for the border,

212
00:11:58,113 --> 00:11:59,569
If you pay I'll take off my top.

213
00:11:59,891 --> 00:12:01,510
Do you remember what I want to order?

214
00:12:01,511 --> 00:12:03,440
Three tacos two tostadas and a soda pop.

215
00:12:03,783 --> 00:12:07,687
Yeah yeah, and don't forget the hot sauce, Cholo!

216
00:12:11,421 --> 00:12:12,768
Don't think just because I got money

217
00:12:12,881 --> 00:12:15,721
I won't still give you taco-flavord kisses, honey.

218
00:12:15,827 --> 00:12:17,616
I'm gonna fulfill all your sexy wishes

219
00:12:17,633 --> 00:12:19,416
Give you lots of taco-flavored kisses

220
00:12:20,052 --> 00:12:21,039
What the hell are you doing?

221
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:22,586
I'm practicing my dancinngg!

222
00:12:23,139 --> 00:12:26,007
Look, we spent all night at the recording studio. Now it's time to sleep!

223
00:12:26,082 --> 00:12:28,907
-Dancing!

224
00:12:29,035 --> 00:12:29,831
Dancing

225
00:12:30,667 --> 00:12:32,128
Moooommm!

226
00:12:32,651 --> 00:12:33,989
What's the matter, sweetie?

227
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:36,044
Ms. Lopez won't go to sleep!

228
00:12:42,621 --> 00:12:43,195
Heyesss.

229
00:12:43,456 --> 00:12:45,645
Hey, I was wondering if I could talk to Ms. Lopez.

230
00:12:46,111 --> 00:12:47,131
She's not here right now.

231
00:12:47,162 --> 00:12:48,859
Ben? Is that my darling Ben?

232
00:12:49,041 --> 00:12:53,650
Jenny? Yes, Jenny, eheh, it's me! Where are you? Please, I-I have to see her!

233
00:12:55,779 --> 00:12:58,541
Ben!!! Oh, you bought me rrrrroses!

234
00:12:59,466 --> 00:13:02,267
Jenny, I just can't stop thinking about you.

235
00:13:02,966 --> 00:13:04,583
I can't stop thinking about you either, Ben!

236
00:13:05,893 --> 00:13:08,307
I've been meaning to write a song or a poem, but I have no talent.

237
00:13:08,758 --> 00:13:09,813
I know, my darleeeng. That's okay.

238
00:13:10,809 --> 00:13:12,595
Will you just take a ride with me in my awesome car?

239
00:13:12,808 --> 00:13:15,205
-Oh Ben, I would LOVE to!
-NO!

240
00:13:15,330 --> 00:13:16,799
Scuse me one second, Ben.

241
00:13:17,001 --> 00:13:19,278
Don't you ruin this opportunity for me! How can you stand in the way of this?!

242
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:19,946
I'm not going out in his car.

243
00:13:19,947 --> 00:13:21,194
I'm not gonna let you blow this one chance I have.

244
00:13:21,195 --> 00:13:22,714
I don't care. I'm supposed to sit here and do my homework.

245
00:13:22,715 --> 00:13:23,422
Don't you dare

246
00:13:23,423 --> 00:13:24,812
I don't care, 'cause I'm the one that's gonna get in trouble if you don't-!

247
00:13:24,813 --> 00:13:26,485

00:13:26,529 --> 00:13:27,917

Oh Ben, you are so perfect, so spectacularrr in every way

252

You bring light into my life, Ben. You almost make me forget all about...

253
00:13:57,097 --> 00:14:02,286
Tacos! Oh, tacos, so good in my tummy yummy yummy give me more.

I love you, Ben. You almost make me forget about...

255
00:14:07,286 --> 00:14:09,891
Tacos......

256
00:14:09,898 --> 00:14:14,019
Jenny, I have to tell you something. I... I think I love you.

257
00:14:14,197 --> 00:14:17,147
Hoohh, I love you too, Ben! But...

258
00:14:17,148 --> 00:14:17,933
But what?

259
00:14:18,017 --> 00:14:21,054
But what if you still have feelings for the slut with the large ass?

260
00:14:22,373 --> 00:14:25,015
I still care for her. Maybe I always will.

261
00:14:25,456 --> 00:14:28,666
But... You just have so much more going on. Up here.

262
00:14:28,854 --> 00:14:31,075
Oh Ben. Beennn.

263
00:14:31,465 --> 00:14:33,393
Jenny, can I kiss you?

264
00:14:33,671 --> 00:14:34,352

265
00:14:34,356 --> 00:14:35,897
Yes! Oh yes, Ben, kiss me!

266

00:14:43,666 --> 00:14:45,346
Taco-flavored kisses for my Ben.

269
00:14:45,703 --> 00:14:46,843
You're so hot, baby.

270
00:14:46,844 --> 00:14:48,164

00:15:02,609 --> 00:15:03,679
But I love her!

278
00:15:03,889 --> 00:15:04,576
Ben!

279
00:15:04,864 --> 00:15:06,723
Jenny! Jenny, I'll call you!

280
00:15:07,007 --> 00:15:08,752

281
00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:13,818

00:15:13,897 --> 00:15:17,043
Two tacos chulo, too. I'm just Jenny from the hood.

283
00:15:17,051 --> 00:15:20,923
Ooo, can I have your tacos? Oh- stop. Stop, stop. STOP!

284
00:15:21,474 --> 00:15:24,135
What the hell is wrong with you?! You cholos can't even keep a beat!

285
00:15:24,517 --> 00:15:27,154
I deserve better than thees! I an Hennifer Lopez!

286
00:15:27,443 --> 00:15:28,437
Where is my water?!

287
00:15:29,668 --> 00:15:31,926
Not Evian, Pellegrino, you stupid beetch!

288
00:15:32,358 --> 00:15:35,003
Uh, that's fine Ms. Lopez. Look, it's been a long night.

289
00:15:35,004 --> 00:15:36,385
Why don't we pick it up in the morning?

290
00:15:36,830 --> 00:15:39,462
Fine my ass, cholo! I'll tell you when it's fine!

291
00:15:41,021 --> 00:15:43,680
Stupid idiots! How am I supposed to make an album with those cholos?!

292
00:15:45,239 --> 00:15:47,207
You little snot-nose!

293
00:15:48,018 --> 00:15:51,191
You ruin my career and now you're trying to steal my man?!

294
00:15:51,453 --> 00:15:52,146
Aww crap.

295
00:15:52,364 --> 00:15:54,121
You'd better stay away from him!

296
00:16:00,113 --> 00:16:03,908
Your son's hand has a hairline fracture and two dislocated fingers.

297
00:16:04,028 --> 00:16:04,679
Oh dear.

298
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:09,640
But I'm more concerned about his state of mind.
Your son appears to be completely insane.

299
00:16:12,635 --> 00:16:13,766
I told you this would happen.

300
00:16:14,063 --> 00:16:15,940
Oh, hello guys.

301
00:16:16,334 --> 00:16:18,404
Cartman, you need to stop this stupid little game you're playing!

302
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:20,818
Oh, Kyle, why you no like meee?

303
00:16:20,818 --> 00:16:24,252
Kyle is right, Ms. Lopez. From now on, we're staying away from Ben Affleck.

304
00:16:24,713 --> 00:16:25,259
I hate you.

305
00:16:26,091 --> 00:16:29,028
Come on, sweetie. Doctor says you need to get home and get lots of rest.

306
00:16:38,648 --> 00:16:40,304
Moooooommmm!

307
00:16:41,627 --> 00:16:42,674
What is it, sweetie?

308
00:16:42,816 --> 00:16:45,253
Ben Affleck is naked in my bed!

309
00:16:45,477 --> 00:16:47,770
Oooo, looks like the tooth fairy was extra-happy with youuu.

310
00:16:49,651 --> 00:16:51,114
Buenos días, my love.

311
00:16:51,427 --> 00:16:52,293
Good morning, baby.

312
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:54,939
You have to get out of here! Jennifer Lopez is gonna kick my ass again!

313
00:16:55,199 --> 00:16:58,375
He's not going anywhere! Ben and I were up all night making love.

314
00:16:59,039 --> 00:17:02,501
What? Oh- AWWW!
Ben Affleck's spooge!!

315
00:17:02,897 --> 00:17:04,048
Should we tell him the news?

316
00:17:04,052 --> 00:17:04,763
What news?

317
00:17:04,764 --> 00:17:05,633
I think we should tell him.

318
00:17:05,662 --> 00:17:06,158
It's S'aright?

319
00:17:06,159 --> 00:17:06,886
-S'aright.
-S'aright.

320
00:17:07,506 --> 00:17:09,280
We're getting married!!

321
00:17:09,315 --> 00:17:11,066
Oh, balls!

322
00:17:13,146 --> 00:17:14,561
Come in.

323
00:17:16,077 --> 00:17:17,252
COME IN!!

324
00:17:19,158 --> 00:17:20,590
Guys, I need to talk to you.

325
00:17:20,908 --> 00:17:21,734
What's the matter?

326
00:17:21,791 --> 00:17:24,975
I can't handle it anymore. All the fame and the Ben Affleck spooge,

327
00:17:24,976 --> 00:17:27,223
I... I just can't go on living with Ms. Lopez.

328
00:17:27,490 --> 00:17:28,450
So stop doing it!

329
00:17:28,779 --> 00:17:29,450
Stop doing what?

330
00:17:29,594 --> 00:17:31,259
You know God-damn well what! Now get outta here!

331
00:17:31,486 --> 00:17:34,588
Please, you guys. It's like, I can't even have a moment to myself anymore. See?

332
00:17:37,331 --> 00:17:38,950
Don't you dare ever do that to me again!

333
00:17:39,238 --> 00:17:41,436
Aw, stop it, Cartman! Your hand hand doesn't need to breathe!

334
00:17:41,472 --> 00:17:43,092
You try being in an oven mitt for two hours!

335
00:17:43,523 --> 00:17:44,614
I can see your lips moving!

336
00:17:44,835 --> 00:17:46,369
I can see your lips moving too, culo!

337
00:17:46,555 --> 00:17:47,896
See?! I just saw your lips move!

338
00:17:48,292 --> 00:17:51,435
Look! I'm just asking you guys for help. Will you please help me with Ms. Lopez.

339
00:17:51,869 --> 00:17:52,750
What's she doing?

340
00:17:52,891 --> 00:17:53,838
Come here!

341
00:17:54,891 --> 00:17:56,403
You're not actually buying this crap, are you?!

342
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:58,202
I don't know, meh, maybe he can't help it.

343
00:17:58,203 --> 00:18:01,742
Look, he knows full well what he's doing, and he's just waiting for us to buy into it,

344
00:18:01,743 --> 00:18:03,755
and then he'll laugh and point at our faces and say,

345
00:18:03,756 --> 00:18:06,683
"Haha, I got you guys to believe me! You guys are stupid!"

346
00:18:06,883 --> 00:18:09,792
Dude, do you really he would go through all this just to make us feal dumb?

347
00:18:10,059 --> 00:18:10,875
YES, dude!

348
00:18:11,925 --> 00:18:17,071
Cartman, we decided that if you can be mature
and admit to everyone that you've gotten
yourself into this mess, then we'll help you.

349
00:18:18,028 --> 00:18:21,399
Okay, okay, I know that I control everything Ms. Lopez does.

350
00:18:21,467 --> 00:18:22,515
Oh no you don't!

351
00:18:22,865 --> 00:18:23,725
Quiet, Ms. Lopez.

352
00:18:24,109 --> 00:18:24,667
Out!

353
00:18:25,042 --> 00:18:27,880
Guys... Uh... Uh...

354
00:18:31,324 --> 00:18:35,414
There you are, Jenny! I've been lookin' all over for you, baby! Jenny?

355
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:41,516
Ms. Lopez, you were due in the studio two hours ago! Come on!

356
00:18:45,052 --> 00:18:47,440
So you're gettin' married, huh?

357
00:18:50,824 --> 00:18:51,865
Don't you hurt her!

358
00:18:52,108 --> 00:18:53,132
We'll sue you!

359
00:18:54,016 --> 00:18:54,721
Oh Jesus.

360
00:19:02,147 --> 00:19:03,351
Freeze, leafblower!

361
00:19:05,012 --> 00:19:07,758
Arrest that woman! She wants to kill one of our artists!

362
00:19:08,051 --> 00:19:10,481
All right, you're going downtown, bean-breath.

363
00:19:10,482 --> 00:19:14,730
Jenny! Oh, I thoughth I was goin' lose you! Let's run away and get married tongiht!

364
00:19:14,831 --> 00:19:17,306
Hey, she can't get married tonight, she has a recording session!

365
00:19:17,454 --> 00:19:18,954
Our love is like rain!

366
00:19:19,153 --> 00:19:21,185
That's what you said about me, asshole!

367
00:19:21,198 --> 00:19:21,924
Quiet!

368
00:19:21,925 --> 00:19:22,998
Get her out of here!

369
00:19:23,123 --> 00:19:23,823
Fuck you!

370
00:19:24,038 --> 00:19:25,585
Shut up, picante pants!

371
00:19:25,814 --> 00:19:27,161
Everyone be quiet!

372
00:19:29,032 --> 00:19:31,605
I'm... I'm not who you think I am.

373
00:19:32,876 --> 00:19:33,534
You're not?

374
00:19:33,837 --> 00:19:37,905
No. It was all a lie. A lie I cannot contimue anymore.

375
00:19:38,380 --> 00:19:41,138
I am not Hennifer Lopez. I am...

376
00:19:42,548 --> 00:19:44,030
...Mitch Connor.

377
00:19:47,097 --> 00:19:47,737
Who is Mitch Connor?

378
00:19:48,152 --> 00:19:49,694
Just your run of the mill con man.

379
00:19:50,031 --> 00:19:53,094
I've been moving from town to town, scamming people since I was fifteen.

380
00:19:53,409 --> 00:19:55,109
But I'm tired of running.

381
00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:56,799
Oh no, no no, nonono.

382
00:19:57,087 --> 00:19:58,458
I've been a cheater all my life.

383
00:19:58,942 --> 00:20:00,222
And now I've ruined a singer's career,

384
00:20:00,487 --> 00:20:01,693
lost a record company millions,

385
00:20:01,964 --> 00:20:03,974
and cost this little boy his precious time.

386
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,044
Stop. It.

387
00:20:05,239 --> 00:20:09,467
Mostly, I'm sorry to you, Ben. I'm sorry I played Tiddly Winks with your heart.

388
00:20:12,817 --> 00:20:17,000
But it's over now. The cyanide pill I took should be taking effect very soon.

389
00:20:17,803 --> 00:20:20,347
Hmph, looks like the sun is goin' down.

390
00:20:21,441 --> 00:20:24,164
I wonder, will I dream?

391
00:20:32,334 --> 00:20:35,223
Well, looks like Mitch Connor has cashed in his last chips.

392
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:40,025
Dude, who the hell is Mitch Connor?

393
00:20:40,326 --> 00:20:41,665
I don't know, Kyle, all right?

394
00:20:41,861 --> 00:20:43,449
Look, I don't care what you guys believe.

395
00:20:43,464 --> 00:20:46,454
But with all the crazy stuff that goes on in this town, isn't it possible,

396
00:20:46,455 --> 00:20:49,716
just possible, that something I don't understand happened here?

397
00:20:52,883 --> 00:20:55,379
All right. All right, I guess it's possible.

398
00:20:56,982 --> 00:20:59,880
I got you kinda! I got you kinda!

399
00:21:02,705 --> 00:21:05,133
Okay, Ms. Lopez, over here we have the toppings station.

400
00:21:05,373 --> 00:21:07,369
This is where all your cheeses and lettuce go on. .

401
00:21:07,610 --> 00:21:09,755
Ow. Look out, muffinhead!

402
00:21:09,897 --> 00:21:13,711
Ahh, look, Ms. Lopez, uh, if you're gonna be a member of the La Taco family,

403
00:21:13,999 --> 00:21:16,234
you're gonna have to learn to get along with people.

404
00:21:16,470 --> 00:21:17,957
Get a what with who?

405
00:21:18,082 --> 00:21:21,246
Uh why don't you start chopping those onions and I'll come check on you a little later?

406
00:21:24,185 --> 00:21:28,286
This is bullshit! How the fuck did I end up working in a La Taco?!

407
00:21:28,441 --> 00:21:32,610
I had six platinum records and I starred in five Hollywood movies!

408
00:21:34,339 --> 00:21:36,287
Yeah. Me too.

409
00:21:36,612 --> 00:21:41,877
Oh Ben, you are so perfect, so spectacularrr in every way

410
00:21:42,847 --> 00:21:48,387
You bring light into my life, Ben. You almost make me forget all about...

411
00:21:48,774 --> 00:21:53,840
Tacos! Oh, tacos, so good in my tummy yummy yummy give me more.

412
00:21:54,446 --> 00:21:58,252
I love you, Ben. You almost make me forget about...

413
00:21:58,933 --> 00:22:01,068
Tacos......



9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
