1
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:39,540
We're here live at the KOZY 102.1
Hallween Haunt at the South Park docks!

2
00:00:39,575 --> 00:00:41,315
Come on down! We've
got a haunted house

3
00:00:41,316 --> 00:00:43,533
and everyone is decorating for
tomorrow night, HALLOWEEN,

4
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:46,360
when the band KoRn, that's
right, KoRn, is going to play live!

5
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:48,360
And don't forget to wear
a costume tomorrow,

6
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:49,800
because there's a big first prize!

7
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:52,000
Why, here's some kids enjoying
the Halloween Haunt now!

8
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:56,080
Say boys, what do you think of
KOZY-FM's Halloween Haunt so far?

9
00:00:57,720 --> 00:01:00,760
This one time, like eight months ago,
I saw two guys kissing in a park.

10
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:04,200
And that was the gayest thing I'd ever seen,
until I saw the KOZY-FM Halloween Haunt.

11
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:07,040
Uh-hall right! Well, enjoy
the spooky docks, kids.

12
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:10,600
Hey you guys! You know what time of year
it is? - Of course, dumbass, it's Halloween.

13
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:13,680
That's right, and that means only
two more months till Christmas!

14
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:15,400
You'd better watch out,
you'd better not cry...

15
00:01:15,435 --> 00:01:16,005
Christmas?

16
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:18,280
Christmastime is presents for me.

17
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:23,000
Aw, nuts! Come on, Ned, this ain't
no whore house, it's a hor-ROR house.

18
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:27,240
- Spooky Laboratory, you guys.
- Those things are stupid, Cartman.

19
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:30,200
They just stick your hand in cold spaghetti
and tell you it's intestines and stuff.

20
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:33,200
Well, I'm going to Spooky Laboratory!
Jingle Bells, Jingle Bells…

21
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:35,960
Welcome to Spooky Laboratory.

22
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:39,840
I'm your guide, Dr. Spookalot. Allow
me to show around the lab. - Cool!

23
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:43,080
Here I have a bowl
of human eyeballs.

24
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:46,560
- And here you can feel the
brains. - Oh-HO, grohoss.

25
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:51,040
And here you can feel the
warm innards of the body

26
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:55,520
Eewww, it feels like cold spaghetti!
You guys, it feels like cold spaghetti!

27
00:01:55,521 --> 00:01:57,121
You guys, I'm gonna try and
win that costume contest!

28
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,354
Give it up, Kenny! You're not
gonna win that costume contest!

29
00:01:59,355 --> 00:02:00,355
Your costumes always suck.

30
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:05,560
We scared you, chickens!

31
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:08,520
- W-we weren't scared!
- Oh no? Well, you should be!

32
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:11,400
- The pirate ghosts are gonna
come getcha! - The what?

33
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:13,920
Didn't you know? There's
an old legend in South Park

34
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:17,080
that says these docks are
haunted by pirate ghosts.

35
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:21,000
They roam these docks with
their swords and hook-hands

36
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:23,720
looking for victims to cut up!

37
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:25,600
That's just an old legend.

38
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:29,600
Gotcha again.

39
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:33,200
Just wait till tomorrow! We're
gonna scare you kids to death!

40
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:37,640
You guys, my hand totally smells
like spaghetti now. Smell it.

41
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,613
I'm sick of those fifth graders
scaring us all the time!

42
00:02:39,614 --> 00:02:40,914
We should come up with
a way to scare them!

43
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:42,240
Yeah! Let's see how they like it!

44
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,800
Joining me now is Father Maxi,
from the South Park Church.

45
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:47,400
Father, what do you think of all the
preparations here at the docks?

46
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:49,840
Halloween is an abomination of God!

47
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,680
A celebration of the occult-eh!

48
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:54,760
Yeah, and how about KoRn playing the big
concert tomorrow? Pretty exciting, huh?

49
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:57,360
KoRn is a devil-worshipping
group that plays violent music!

50
00:02:57,520 --> 00:03:00,800
If we allow that demon band to play
on this most unholy of holidays,

51
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:03,000
we may incur the full wrath of evil!

52
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:05,160
Alright, we'll see you
tomorrow for Halloween!

53
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:07,920
In the meantime here's a
KOZY hit by Barry Manilow.

54
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:10,866
Come on, you guys, think! How
can we scare the fifth graders?

55
00:03:10,867 --> 00:03:12,667
It has to be
something reeaally scary.

56
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:16,840
We could get a big scary plastic spider,
and dangle it in front of them on a string…

57
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,640
spooky spider, that's pretty scary.

58
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:19,800
That's not scary, fatass!

59
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:23,000
Well, come on! We can think of something
better than stupid pirate ghosts!

60
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:34,120
- Are you sure we're goin'
the right way? - I don't know.

61
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:35,560
This map doesn't
make any sense.

62
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:39,040
That's because you've got it
upside down, chowderhead!

63
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,080
When are we gonna get
to the gig? I'm starving.

64
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:45,080
Don't think about it. We'll just
keep playing our game. Raady?

65
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:47,920
I spy with my little eye something
that begins with the letter T!

66
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:49,760
I know! A t-ree!

67
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:51,960
You've got it. I spy
with my little eye

68
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:54,160
something that begins
with the letter R.

69
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,160
- A road?
- That's it!

70
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:05,280
Okay, here's one.

71
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:08,200
I spy with my little eye something
that begins with the letter P.

72
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:11,280
- The letter P? - What the
heck starts with the letter P?

73
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:12,800
Pirate ghosts!

74
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:26,800
Mom! You got the
new Duffy's catalog!

75
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:30,320
I-I'm gonna circle everything
I want for Christmas, okay?

76
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:32,560
Mom? Okay?

77
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:39,200
O-kay, let's see.
I waant… thiis… aand… this…

78
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:49,892
Eric, your little friends are here.

79
00:04:49,893 --> 00:04:51,493
Mom, mom! You wanna see
what I want for Christmas?

80
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:53,040
E-heric, it's only Halloween.

81
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:55,320
That's only 72 shopping
days left for you!

82
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:57,960
- Come on, fatass, we have to go!
- Ey! Don't call me fat!

83
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:01,960
- Mom, don't laugh.
- I'm sorry, hon.

84
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:04,880
- I can't go with you guys right now.
- Yes you can, porky.

85
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:06,640
Mom, seriously!

86
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:09,800
Oh, that's not funny, boys.
Eric isn't fat, his big-boned.

87
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:12,480
He must have a huge
bone in his ass, then.

88
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:14,800
God-damnit, mom!

89
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:16,520
God, I hate you guys!

90
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:18,280
Okay, so we figured out how
to scare the fifth graders.

91
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:20,080
- How? - What's the
scariest thing we could get?

92
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:22,800
- Spooky spider?
- No! A dead body.

93
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:24,120
Yeah, fatass, a dead body.

94
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:25,880
You mean, we make something
that looks like a dead body?

95
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:27,497
We could never make one
that looks real enough.

96
00:05:27,498 --> 00:05:29,798
To be really scary,
it would have to be real.

97
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:31,720
Yeah, fatass, it has
to be real to be scary!

98
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:33,200
So where the hell are we
going to get a dead body?

99
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,000
We're gonna dig up
Kyle's dead grandma.

100
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:36,920
Yeah, fatass, we're goona dig up...

101
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:38,520
Dig up Kyle's dead grandma?

102
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:41,360
Dude, she's perfect. She only died, like,
three months ago, right? - Are you insane?!

103
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,080
Hi think that's a sweet idea!

104
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:45,960
Dude! We'er not digging up my
grandma; I'll get in trouble.

105
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:47,880
All we have to do is sneak
in the graveyard, dig her up,

106
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:50,240
scare the fifth graders, then put her
back before anyone notices she's gone.

107
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:53,280
- Naww, let's dig up somebody else.
- Relax, dude. What's the big deal?

108
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:55,021
Think about it: if your grandma
knew that she could help you,

109
00:05:55,022 --> 00:05:56,522
even in death,
she would want to.

110
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,000
This is gonna be fun!

111
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,040
Just hear those sleigh bells
jingle-in', ring ting tingle-in' too.

112
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:07,520
Outside it's lovely weather for a sleigh
ride together with you, and you, and you.

113
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,252
Cartman, will you stop
singing Christmas carols?

114
00:06:09,266 --> 00:06:12,026
We have to be quiet, or else
we're gonna get busted!

115
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:13,480
This must be it.

116
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:15,000
Cleo Broflovski.

117
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:16,400
That's my grandma.

118
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:19,840
- Well, let's dig 'er up!
- Wait. I don't know if this is cool.

119
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,825
Of course it's cool! She's
gonna be all rotted and scary!

120
00:06:21,826 --> 00:06:23,526
I don't think my mom
would want me doin' this.

121
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:27,120
"I don't wanna dig up my dead grandma
'cause I'm such a goody-two-shoes!"

122
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,680
You guys be quiet! Now, do you wanna
get back at the fifth graders or not?!

123
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:33,200
- I don't really care, dude.
- Yes you do! Now, dig!

124
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:37,920
Outside the snow is falling and
friends are calling, "You-hoo"…

125
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:44,840
Okay. It's almost open.
Ready? One, two, three!

126
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:49,320
- Whoa, dude.
- Oh, my God.

127
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:53,000
Hi… Grandma.

128
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:54,240
Hi, Kyle.

129
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:58,320
Have you been a good boy, Kyle?
Have you been making Grandma proud?

130
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:00,840
- Damnit, Cartman, that's not
funny! - Eheh, yes, it ihis, heh.

131
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Heh heh, I'm sweet.

132
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:04,280
Alright, alright, let's get this
over with so we can put her back!

133
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:05,800
Okay, grab the sled.

134
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:18,240
Silver Bells, Silver Bells,
it's Christmas time in the city…

135
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:21,156
Okay. Let's just hide her here, and
tomorrow, during the Halloween party

136
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:23,040
we'll come back in our costumes and
use her to scare the fifth graders.

137
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:24,800
How exactly are we gonna
use her to scare them?

138
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:27,400
We could shove a stick up her
ass and use her like a puppet!

139
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:28,920
I'm scary Grandma!

140
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:31,275
Alright, that does it, Cartman!
That's my grandma!

141
00:07:31,276 --> 00:07:33,176
You show her some
God-damned respect!

142
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:37,800
- Who was that? - Cartman?!
- It wasn't me!

143
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:41,400
Dude, not cool. This is scary.

144
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:45,080
Hey! Like, it's just some kids.

145
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:47,640
I was really scared
there, for a second.

146
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:48,960
Hay, you're that band KoRn.

147
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:52,360
Yeah. I'm Jonathan, and this is
Munky, David, Fieldy, and Head.

148
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:55,480
And over there is our pal, Nibblet.
Hey, where'd Nibblet go?

149
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:57,960
Nibblet likes potato chips.

150
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,720
Nibblet!

151
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:01,640
What are you guys
doing out here?

152
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:04,088
We were just driving our van when
all of a sudden we were run off the

153
00:08:04,089 --> 00:08:06,549
road by some super-spooky
pirate ghosts.

154
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:08,120
Aw, dude, that was
just the fifth graders.

155
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:10,320
Yeah. They're tryin' to scare
everybody 'cause they're gay wads.

156
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:11,600
Don't worry. We're about
to go get 'em back.

157
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:14,720
Oh, swell. We're supposed to play here
tomorrow. Do you know where the stage is?

158
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:17,200
- Yeah, dude. It's right
over there. - O-kay!

159
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:21,200
Oh, hi. We're KoRn. We're supposed to
play the Halloween concert tomorrow.

160
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:23,680
I know who you are and
what you stand for!

161
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:26,080
I think your music and
Halloweenn is an abomination!

162
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:28,040
Groovy! Could you show
us where to set up?

163
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:30,520
Alright, let's just set her over
here behind these boxes.

164
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:33,520
Shouldn't we hide her better than that?
- Kyle, will you stop worrying? God!

165
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:36,165
Now, we'll all be back here tomorrow
with our costumes, and then,

166
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:38,400
when the Halloween party gets going,
we'll bust out dead Grandma! Let's go!

167
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:40,880
Wait till you guys see my
costume! It's gonan be sweet!

168
00:08:40,881 --> 00:08:42,381
Mine is so fuckin'
badass it's gotta win now!

169
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:44,555
Oh, come on, Kenny! You never
have a sweet costume!

170
00:08:44,556 --> 00:08:46,056
You're not gonna win
the costume contest!

171
00:08:46,057 --> 00:08:48,184
Yes I am! I've got the costume;
it's waiting in the house!

172
00:08:48,185 --> 00:08:51,885
Yesterday I got this huge package
in the mail, and it was big, okay?

173
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,080
Hold on, kids.

174
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:04,480
Mrs. Broflovski?

175
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:08,400
We're from Mt. Peaceful Cemetery.
Could we have a word with you?

176
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:10,160
Eehh, sure, come in.

177
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:13,880
What is it?

178
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:17,960
Ms. Broflovski… somebody has
defiled your mother's grave.

179
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:19,000
Defiled? How?

180
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:21,800
Well, I'm afraid that…
somebody dug her up.

181
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:23,040
Dug her up? Why?

182
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,320
Well. The most
likely reason is that…

183
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:28,240
somebody wanted to have
sex with her dead body.

184
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,560
We don't want to upset
you, but it happens.

185
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:34,400
Somebody's probably making
love to her corpse as we speak.

186
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:37,640
Every vile position, every
disrespectful act imaginable.

187
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:38,840
Hoh, dear God!

188
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,280
Yes. By now he's probably
even removed her eyes

189
00:09:41,315 --> 00:09:43,320
and made love to the
empty sockets as well.

190
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:46,247
No, we don't want to upset
you, but you should know

191
00:09:46,248 --> 00:09:48,048
that your mother's body
would be stiff and dry,

192
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,993
so he would have to have it
soaked in warm water

193
00:09:49,994 --> 00:09:51,994
for several hours
before making love to it.

194
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:55,280
- Yes. And, now for the
difficult part. - Brace yourself.

195
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:59,320
It is highly possible that he has created
new orifices in her decomposing flesh,

196
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:03,560
leaving her to look something like an over
loved hunk of Swiss cheese. She probably...

197
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:07,520
Okay, okay! I get the point! Just tell
me what you're gonna do about it!

198
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:11,560
- Do? - Oh, we don't do anything.
We're just the watchmen.

199
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:14,120
Yeah, I guess, maybe, you might
wanna call the police or something.

200
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:19,800
Now, he probably would make love to
the dead body in a cool dry place,

201
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:21,920
so as not to allow
further decomposition.

202
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:27,000
Package delivery for Mrs. Cartman?

203
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:29,920
A package? Oh, really?

204
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:31,200
Well, I think I can sign for that!

205
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:33,880
Sign heah, and heah, and heah.

206
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:36,840
I got a Christmas present!
I got a Christmas present!

207
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:41,280
Maybe I can see what it is.
I'll just open one little corner.

208
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:43,960
That's good,
I'll rewrap it later!

209
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:48,400
Oh, sweet! Life-sized blow-up
Antonio Banderas love doll!

210
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:51,680
With realistic geni-ta-lia.

211
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:55,520
Oh, this kicks ass! What a cool
Christmas present my mom got!

212
00:10:56,440 --> 00:11:00,200
It's Halloween day, so come on down
to the docks and bring your costumes!

213
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:02,600
Where's Kenny? He said he had
the best Halloween costume ever.

214
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:06,720
Guess wha-at I got?
Antonio Banderas blow-up doll.

215
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:08,360
You guys didn't get one.

216
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:09,520
Where's your costume, fatass?

217
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:12,080
Screw Halloween, I already
got my Christmas present!

218
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:14,902
In a few days I'll wrap it back up, and
then when I open it on Christmas,

219
00:11:14,903 --> 00:11:16,003
I'll act all, like, surprised, like:

220
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:19,640
"Oh Mother, Antonio Banderas life-sized
blow-up doll! What a surprise!"

221
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,160
Hey, Kenny.

222
00:11:28,161 --> 00:11:30,061
Hey, guys. Uh, check out
this kick-ass cool costume.

223
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:32,600
U-huh, nice costume, Kenny. If you
think you're gonna win with that, huh!

224
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:34,854
Alright. The fifth graders are gonna
be here soon. Let's get Kyle's grandma!

225
00:11:34,855 --> 00:11:37,555
This is gonna be sweet!

226
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:39,920
- Uuh, problem, guys.
- What's the problem?

227
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:42,120
- Nno Grandma.
- No Grandma?

228
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,440
- Nno Grandma. - She's not
here! - She has to be here!

229
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,720
Well, she's not here!
That's just great!

230
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:50,000
Thanks a lot, Stan! You're
gonna get me busted again!

231
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:53,520
Okay, people. I know we all want to get
down to the docks for the Halloween Haunt

232
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:56,800
but first we just need to inform you
about thee people or persons out there

233
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:59,960
digging up bodies to have
sex with them. Gentlemen?

234
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:01,840
Good afternoon,
ladies and gentlemen.

235
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:06,040
A person who steals bodies to have
sex with them is called a necrophiliac.

236
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:09,600
So that you all know what to expect,
my partner Alan has draw a sketch

237
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:13,160
of what having sex with
a dead body might look like.

238
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:17,840
Yes, we know it's horrible. It's
probably best you not look at it.

239
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:22,960
Now, Alan will demostrate what having
sex with a dead body might sound like.

240
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:31,400
Excuse me, how is this helping?

241
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:35,040
That's it, folks. Now, we can all go to the
docks and enjoy the Halloween Haunt.

242
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,640
Noo! Don't go to the docks!

243
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:41,360
I'm Captain Bly!

244
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:43,864
You land-lubbers had better
stay away from the docks!

245
00:12:43,865 --> 00:12:46,465
Or else, there'll be hell to pay!

246
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:48,240
Fire the cannon!

247
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:00,800
We won't warn ya again!
Stay away from our docks!

248
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:07,560
I warned you! I told
you this would happen!

249
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:09,800
When you allow bands like
KoRn to come to town

250
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:13,200
and play your hedonistic Hallowen
concerts, this is what you get!

251
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:19,240
Great rehearsal, gang.
That was really groovy.

252
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:22,080
Let's practice one more time
before the show starts.

253
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:26,000
Guys, I'm sorry, but the Halloween
Haunt's been cancelled. - Cancelled?

254
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:28,480
You best clear out of here! There's
pirate ghosts, and they'll kill you.

255
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:31,120
Well gang, it looks like
we have to pack it up.

256
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:33,680
God-damnit! Now, what
the hell are we gonna do?!

257
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:35,720
Oh, hey! The kids from last night.

258
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:39,500
Wow! Is that the Antonio
Banderas life-sized blow-up doll?

259
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,000
Hey, Kenny.

260
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:49,800
Say, what's the matter?
You kids look kind of glum.

261
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:52,000
- Somebody took my
dead grandma. - What?

262
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:53,900
We dug her up 'cause we
wanted to scare the fifth graders,

263
00:13:53,901 --> 00:13:55,401
but then, something
took her body away.

264
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:58,280
Now she's doomed to
walk the earth in limbo.

265
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:00,600
Aw, I hate to see
little clowns cry.

266
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:03,040
Well, that does it. Somethin'
funny is going on here.

267
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:06,320
Your missing grandma must be connected
somehow to those creepy pirate ghosts.

268
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:09,560
They're not pirate ghosts,
Jonathan, they're ghost pirates.

269
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:12,600
"Pirate ghost" would suggest that
a pirate died, and became a ghost,

270
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:16,360
but a ghost pirate is a ghost that later
made a conscious decision to be a pirate.

271
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:19,640
No, David. Then they are pirate ghosts,
because they're the ghosts of pirates.

272
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:21,560
You're wrong, because there
were no pirates in Colorado.

273
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:24,440
So these must be ghosts that have
decided to become pirates after the fact.

274
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:28,000
- But that makes them pirate ghosts.
- No. It makes them ghost pirates.

275
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:31,480
Guys! Guys! Guys! Fighting
isn't gonna solve anything.

276
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:34,880
Don't you see? This is exactly what
those ghost pirates want us to do.

277
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:35,840
Pirate ghosts.

278
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,080
Then, you'll help us?

279
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:39,680
Sure, we'll help you. If there's one thing
we like more than playing music,

280
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:41,360
it's solvin' a groovy mystery.

281
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:42,320
Al-right!

282
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:45,760
Is everybody okay?

283
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:49,360
People stealing bodies to have sex with
them? Pirate ghosts destroying the town?

284
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:51,160
When did everything go so wrong?

285
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:54,885
I hate to say it, but I think Priest
Maxi was right. This is what we get

286
00:14:54,890 --> 00:14:57,640
for celebrating Halloween and
allowing that band KoRn to come play.

287
00:14:57,800 --> 00:15:02,160
He's right! Nothin' ever went wrong in this
town before that evil KoRn band showed up.

288
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:06,200
Well, I say we go find them and kick their
devil-worshipping butts out of town!

289
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:09,560
Lynch mob!

290
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:16,760
So this is where you last
saw your dead grandma?

291
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:19,200
Right. Maybe there really are pirate
ghosts and they took her inside.

292
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:21,800
Alright, gang, we have to
split up and look for clues.

293
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:22,640
How should we split up?

294
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:25,574
I know. Let's have everyone who
enjoys having obstacles in their life,

295
00:15:25,575 --> 00:15:27,075
which they can
overcome, go this way,

296
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:29,179
and everyone whose
insecurities sabotage

297
00:15:29,180 --> 00:15:31,780
their potential to overcome
those obstacles go that way.

298
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:32,600
Okay!

299
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:38,200
Wow! That was easy.

300
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:40,680
Here's their van!
Here's their van!

301
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:45,800
- Let's flip it over! - Okay,
people, let's try to stay orderly.

302
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:49,360
The best way to do this is, all get on
one side and push it from the top.

303
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:51,680
Devil woshippers!

304
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:54,040
Come on, they gotta be
around here somewhere!

305
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:55,280
This place gives me the creeps.

306
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:57,840
Say, this looks like a clue.

307
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,520
"Pirate Lore of South Park".

308
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:02,400
Now, why would pirate ghosts
need a book on pirates?

309
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:04,680
Whoa. What was that?

310
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:07,760
The noise came from in here.
Stay close, everybody!

311
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:11,400
Oh, no! I lost my glasses.

312
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:13,320
What does this dead
grandma look like?

313
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:16,240
Uh, she was all, like, crunchy
and crispy and stuff.

314
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:18,920
Hey, I got an idea.
We should set a groovy trap.

315
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:20,000
Good idea.

316
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:21,400
How do we trap a
bunch of pirate ghosts?

317
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:24,800
We need something that might catch
their eye to use as bait. I know!

318
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:26,960
Your Antonio Banderas love doll.

319
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:28,849
Oh, no! This is my
Christmas present!

320
00:16:28,850 --> 00:16:30,750
If anything happens to it, my
mom will know I opened it early!

321
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:33,800
Come on, kid. We all have
to do our part, even Antonio.

322
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:37,000
My glasses gotta be
around here somewhere.

323
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:40,600
Is that you, Jonathan? Boy, I'm
glad to see you. I lost my glasses.

324
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:43,400
Hey, you got a cold, Jonathan?

325
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:47,640
Yeah, that sounds like a groovy
song, man! Remember that one!

326
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:49,680
Fieldy, what are you doing?!

327
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:51,560
Oh, I was talking
to you, Jonathan.

328
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:52,800
Hey, wait a minute.

329
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:57,160
If you're over there, then how could you
be over here? Unless you're actually a…

330
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:59,360
Puh-puuhh pirate ghost!

331
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,440
Okay. Here's how
the trap will work.

332
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:05,880
When the pirate ghosts walk in, they
should go right for Antonio Banderas.

333
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:09,200
When they hit the super-slippery floor,
they'll slide onto this mining cart,

334
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:11,520
which should travel down
this path, into the next room,

335
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:13,680
where the fish net
will fall on them.

336
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:16,240
Wow, cool!
- Hey! Somebody's coming.

337
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,040
We've got to hide!

338
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:21,900
Hey, there's Antonio
Banderas! He'll help us.

339
00:17:21,935 --> 00:17:22,900
Jonathan, no!

340
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:30,400
Hold on, guys!

341
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:35,400
lright, KoRn, time for
you to get out of town!

342
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:41,200
KoRn is sending their
demon minions upon us!

343
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:45,840
Alright, gang. Looks like we're gonna
have to use our special KoRn powers.

344
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:48,800
KoRn powers, vitalize!

345
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:53,440
Form of… CORN!

346
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:11,200
Alright! Great job, gang!

347
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:14,800
- That didn't help at all.
- We know. It's just cool to do.

348
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:17,560
Nibblet!

349
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,080
What the hell is that thing?

350
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:24,800
You did it, Nibblet!
You trapped them!

351
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:27,640
Yeah. And now let's see who
these pirate ghosts really are!

352
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:31,120
Oh, I guess they really
were pirate ghosts.

353
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:35,600
Alright, KoRn, you can stop your demonic
shenanigans and come downtown with me!

354
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:37,560
Hehey, look what Nibblet sees.

355
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:41,200
- What the…?
- Fr. Maxi?

356
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:44,480
Well, what are you waiting for,
Barbrady?! Arrest that band!

357
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:46,000
No! Arrest him!

358
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:49,440
I think I've got this
groovy mystery solved!

359
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:53,720
Well, I must say I
still don't get this at all.

360
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:56,040
It's simple. Priest Maxi didn't
want there to be a Halloween,

361
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:58,280
so he decided to scare
everyone away from the docks.

362
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:02,480
Yeah. And then he used this flashlight and
some cotton swabs to create the ghosts.

363
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:08,760
Then all he needed was some sound effects
created by this cup and a piece of cheese.

364
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:12,760
And all he had to do then
was create a ghost ship,

365
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:16,240
by using some candles,
a mirror, and two squirrels.

366
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:19,800
Father, why did you
go to all this trouble?

367
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:22,240
Because Halloween is
an abomination of God.

368
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:25,400
I would do anything to stop
this wretched, unholy holiday!

369
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:28,440
Including killing people and
wreaking havoc all over South Park?

370
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:30,749
Don't you see that by
trying to stop Halloween

371
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:32,965
you've scared the hell
out of everybody? - No.

372
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,680
Okay buddy, you can
explain downtown!

373
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:37,318
Well, this is all fine and good,

374
00:19:37,319 --> 00:19:39,319
but it doesn't explain what
happened to my mother's body!

375
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:40,440
Yeah! Where's Grandma?

376
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:53,040
There she is!

377
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:57,880
Well thanks a lot, KoRn! You KoRn
powers really came through for us!

378
00:19:58,040 --> 00:20:01,120
Yes! We were wrong about you. Will
you please play for our Halloween party?

379
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:04,460
Well, sure. Why the
heck not? - All right!

380
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:07,480
Oh, no! The pirate
ghosts are back!

381
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:10,960
Nibblet!

382
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:16,960
Well, this sure has been a wacky night,

383
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:19,160
but me and the gang learned
a lot, and we hope you did too.

384
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:21,560
You all perceived us to
be mean, evil people,

385
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:23,120
but, really, we're just
normal guys. And we all

386
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:25,720
perceived pirate ghosts to be real when,
actually, they were just cotton swabs.

387
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:27,226
So I guess the lesson is:

388
00:20:27,227 --> 00:20:29,527
it's easy to perceive somethin'
someway, and then be wrong.

389
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:31,880
So we all need to learn to
be a little less perceptive.

390
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:36,720
The gang and I wrote a song about it, and
it goes goes a little somethin' like this:

391
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:39,200
And a-one, and-a-two, and a...

392
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:56,880
Sweet!

393
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:01,560
Antonio, no!

394
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:04,480
You son of a bitch chicken from
outer space thing, come back here!

395
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:12,040
And the winner of the
costume contest is:

396
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:14,280
Wendy, for her Chewbacca costume!

397
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:16,440
Come on up, Wendy.



9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
