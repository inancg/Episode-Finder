00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:13,720
Marklar! This is Marklar!
Approaching Marklar!

2
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:16,720
Proceed with Marklar
and make first contact!

3
00:00:16,831 --> 00:00:17,414
Marklar.

4
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:32,320
Greetings, Marklars!
I am Marklar!

5
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:37,640
I come in Marklar!

6
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:40,960
Oh, Marklar!

7
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:03,720
Hello, everyone!
I am sister Hollis!

8
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:06,440
I was chosen from my mission
work to come here to Africa

9
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:09,600
and teach you all about
the teachings of Jesus!

10
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:14,080
Okay, then! Do we have our bibles
that were handed out freely?!

11
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:18,880
No, no, no! We don't eat
the bibles! We read them!

12
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:21,360
Now, let's turn to Mark 3:19!

13
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:23,720
Come on! Remember!

14
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:27,640
Reading bible plus
accepting Jesus equals food!

15
00:01:28,857 --> 00:01:31,800
Good! Now, who can
read Mark 3:19?!

16
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:33,800
How 'bout Marvin!

17
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:40,080
o, Marvin! In God's
language, English!

18
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:44,600
Where're you going?!
Back to your life of sin?!

19
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,168
Don't you understand that
unless you find Christ,

20
00:01:47,169 --> 00:01:49,969
you and all your people are
doomed to eternal hellfire?!

21
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:14,360
And so, children, that's why
Hare Krishnas are totally gay!

22
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:21,000
- Uh, can I help you?!
- Yes!

23
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:24,480
I'm Connley, and this is
Finx! We're with the CIA!

24
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:26,640
We're here to speak with
some of your students!

25
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:29,040
You, you, you, and you.

26
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:31,640
Oh, for Pete's sake! What've
you bastards done now?!

27
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,800
Hey! That was Kyle that
went number two in urinal!

28
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:35,840
No, it wasn't, fatass!
I saw YOU do it

29
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,040
Boys, we need to talk to you about
a matter of national security!

30
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,280
Now!

31
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:45,480
I hope you give 'em the chair!

32
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:49,360
Anyway, children, as I was saying,
Hare Krishnas are totally gay!

33
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,440
- Oh, dude! This is not good!
- Relax, fatass!

34
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:58,160
No, dude! I've seen this on TV!
They shine that light in your face

35
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:01,320
and then they try to get you to tell them
stuff by squeezing your balls really hard!

36
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:02,440
- What?!
- Dude, I've seen it!

37
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:05,361
They grab your balls with their leather
gloved hands and they squeeze

38
00:04:05,362 --> 00:04:08,962
them as hard as they can
until they pop like little grapes!

39
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:10,760
Start with Kenny!
Start with Kenny!

40
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:13,920
- Relax, boys! We just need to
talk with you! - I told you, fatass!

41
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:17,885
Approximately 31 hours ago, an ethnic
looking child was spotted flying

42
00:04:17,886 --> 00:04:20,356
some kind of state-of-the-art
aircraft over Chinese Airspace!

43
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:22,232
Woah! Cool!
- Cool?!

44
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:25,520
That craft appears to have enough plutonium
fuel aboard to blow-up a large city!

45
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,880
- Do you think that's cool?!
- Totally!

46
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:32,200
Alright, children! We just need to know
one thing! Do you know this person?!

47
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:34,480
- Hey! That's Starvin Marvin!
- Who?!

48
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:36,760
You dumbass, Cartman! Now they're
gonna go squeeze his balls!

49
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:38,000
Oh! We don't know him!

50
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:39,880
We already know you know him!

51
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:41,880
We have this! Now who is he!?

52
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:45,134
Ooo! Kyle's makin' mud
pies! Y'guys want one?!

53
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:50,600
This is getting us nowhere! We'll have
to resort to more drastic measures!

54
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:52,560
But they're just kids!
We can't torture them!

55
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,650
Look! We don't know what
that craft is capable of,

56
00:04:54,651 --> 00:04:56,651
but the kid is going to
have to land it somewhere!

57
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:59,093
God only knows what sadistic
backwards third world country

58
00:04:59,094 --> 00:05:00,394
could get their hands on that ship!

59
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:03,960
Sauring so high above the world!

60
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:08,040
Never thought I could feel so free!

61
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:12,480
I'm one with the birds
and magic is all I see!

62
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:13,880
Oi! Look up there!

63
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:18,960
It's a UFO!

64
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:26,360
Oi! That's one creepy alien!

65
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:29,320
Talk to 'im, mayor!

66
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:34,680
Great and noble alien creature,

67
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:37,286
as mayor of the fine
planet of Australia,

68
00:05:37,287 --> 00:05:41,187
I welcome you to our fine...
planet of Australia!

69
00:05:41,847 --> 00:05:43,259
Chipie chip! Charah!

70
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:46,080
Look out! He's got a gun!

71
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:51,920
Wait! It's not a gun!
It's a piece of paper!

72
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:01,760
I think he's trying to tell us that he wants
to relocate all his speicies here to Australia!

73
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:05,080
Well, ya certainly
are welcome here, alien!

74
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:08,706
In fact, there's a mission right over
there that will take all your people in!

75
00:06:08,741 --> 00:06:09,668
Hello!

76
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:16,440
Guess the little pecker
didn't like missionaries!

77
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:21,560
Now, I'll ask you again! Who is the
little boy that took our ship?!

78
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:23,320
We don't know!

79
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:28,760
Who is this person?!

80
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:31,860
K-kill me!

81
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:32,760
Do it again!

82
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:34,920
No, wait! I'll tell ya!

83
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:38,920
He's, he's a little starving
Ethiopian kid! We adopted him!

84
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:41,720
- Adopted from who?!
- Sally! Sally Struthers!

85
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:44,280
The lady on TV! She knows
everything! Sally Struthers!

86
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:45,640
Sally Struthers!

87
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:49,077
Where can we find her?! - I know
exactly where Sally Struthers is!

88
00:06:49,212 --> 00:06:49,936
Let them go!

89
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:52,320
Good job, fatass!

90
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:54,245
Dude, I couldn't take that balloon!
Another couple of hours

91
00:06:54,246 --> 00:06:55,746
of that and I'd've been
totally pissed off!

92
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:57,360
Whatever! Let's
go see what's on TV!

93
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:03,080
Gentlemen, Miss Struthers
can see you now!

94
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:07,480
I'm warning you, Bill! Sally
Struthers is a bit heavy!

95
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:09,520
But don't say anything
because she's pretty sensitive!

96
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:10,840
Oh, I would
never say anything!

97
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,480
I saw some show where they made
fun of Sally Struthers' weight

98
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:16,640
and I thought it was totally cruel!
I mean, she helps people, you know!

99
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:19,487
Ah! Miss Struthers!

100
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:30,242
Miss Struthers, we understand you
have helped raise millions of dollars

101
00:07:30,243 --> 00:07:32,743
to help starving
children in Ethiopia!

102
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:38,360
We need information on
one of the Ethiopians!

103
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:40,440
You must tell us everything
you know about him!

104
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:44,000
His name... is...
Starving Marvin!

105
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:54,360
Why, yes it is a Chocolate
Yum Yum Bar, Miss Struthers!

106
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:56,320
And, there are several more
where that came from!

107
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:02,280
Of course, if you don't want to tell
us about the Ethiopian boy...

108
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:07,360
I'm glad we can do business!

109
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:11,924
C'mon, dude! There's gotta be something
about Starvin Marvin in the news!

110
00:08:11,925 --> 00:08:13,525
Well, I can't find anything!
Wait! What's this?!

111
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,880
God wants you to
send us money!

112
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:18,720
He needs you to send us
money so we can help others!

113
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:21,640
Oh, my God! This guy again! - Why would
anybody send this asshole money?!

114
00:08:21,641 --> 00:08:23,505
To take it and
shove it in his peehole!

115
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:35,040
Starvin Marvin!

116
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:36,960
He DID take the ship!

117
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:39,760
Well, nice job, Marvin! I hope you got about
a thousand dollars to pay for maw haws!

118
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:42,000
Dude, you're gonna get
busted for taking this thing!

119
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:45,080
- I think he wants us to get in!
- Kickass!

120
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:48,920
- Wow! This thing is awesome!
- Let's go somewhere!

121
00:08:51,668 --> 00:08:54,920
Sauring so high
above the world!

122
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:57,680
Never thought
I could be so free!

123
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:02,600
I'm one with the birds
and magic is all I see!

124
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:04,040
This is great!

125
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:06,440
Yeah, but where's that crappy song
comming from?! Can we turn that off?!

126
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:08,440
Yeah! That's better!

127
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:14,400
Hello! How we doing today?!

128
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:16,360
Look what I got for you!

129
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:19,640
No! It's not food! It's a cross!

130
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:22,000
And it has your christian
name printed on it!

131
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:24,400
From now on, you are Michael!

132
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:26,520
Can you say Michael?!

133
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:34,560
Oh, well! You'll get it!

134
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:38,000
Hello, brother David! Do you
have any sins to confess?!

135
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:41,200
Anybody?! Sins to confess?!

136
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:42,600
Joshua?!

137
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:46,040
You know, today, I'm
reminded of Psalm 46, line 39.

138
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:48,720
"Though the mountains shake and...".
- Here they are!

139
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:50,880
- Who are you?! - We're with
the American Government!

140
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:53,560
Sally Struthers told us where
we'd find Marvin's parents!

141
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:56,680
Hello there, Mr. and
Mrs. Click Click Dirk!

142
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:58,880
I think you know
why we're here!

143
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:05,465
No, dude! You don't wanna
bring your people to Mexico!

144
00:10:05,466 --> 00:10:07,466
There's missionaries there too!

145
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,400
No way! Not Utah! Utah's
nothing BUT missionaries!

146
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:12,640
Dude, it looks like he's tried
everywhere in the world!

147
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:14,480
Well, he hasn't been here
yet! Where's this?!

148
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:19,600
What the hell did
you hit, Cartman?!

149
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:22,240
Oh, my God! What
the hell is that thing?!

150
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:36,520
Where are we?!

151
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:47,280
We're on like some foreign planet! - This
place is rad! Look at all the trees and stuff!

152
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:55,240
Greetings!

153
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:57,200
Welcome to Marklar!

154
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:58,400
Uh, thanks!

155
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:01,640
I am Marklar,
leader of the Marklar!

156
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:04,720
Uh, cool! My name is Stan
and uh, I'm the leader of Earth!

157
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:07,098
- Marklar to you!
- Cool!

158
00:11:07,123 --> 00:11:09,440
Hey! I'm the leader of Earth! - Screw
you, Cartman! I called "leader" first!

159
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:12,160
Well, you can call "leader" till your ass
bleeds, but it doesn't make it true!

160
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:22,240
We are very thankful to you for
bringing our Marklar back to us!

161
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:24,520
I thought you called
your PLANET Marklar!

162
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:29,240
Oh, here on Marklar, we refer to all
people, places, and things as Marklar!

163
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:32,204
Well, our friend, Marvin, and all his
people have to live on a part of Earth

164
00:11:32,205 --> 00:11:34,105
that sucks ass! They
can't grow food or nothin'!

165
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:35,449
Yeah, so it would be
really cool if you would

166
00:11:35,450 --> 00:11:37,050
let Marvin and all his
people come live here!

167
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:39,680
Well, there is a lot
of room on Marklar!

168
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:42,640
If Marklar here wants to
bring his Marklar to Marklar,

169
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:43,840
that would be fine!

170
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,640
Just take our Marklar back to Marklar
and bring all the Marklar back with you!

171
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:49,520
Uh, thanks!

172
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:55,000
Let's go through this one more
time, Mr. and Mrs. Click Click Dirk!

173
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:59,440
Your son Marvin has a ship that we
want! How can we get it from him?!

174
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:02,400
We are the CIA! That
ship needs to be with us!

175
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:05,400
Maybe we should just take
something precious of yours, huh!

176
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,400
Aha! This! This
gourd-thingy for instance!

177
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:12,133
How do you like that, huh?!
If you ever want to see this...

178
00:12:12,134 --> 00:12:15,834
little... thingy again, I
suggest you contact your boy!

179
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:21,800
There his is!

180
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:33,080
Back away from the
spacecraft, children!

181
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:36,282
No! No, it's okay! The ship
took us to another planet!

182
00:12:36,283 --> 00:12:38,083
A beautiful lush
place called Marklar!

183
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:41,080
Yeah! And the leader, he says that
all the Ethiopians can go live there!

184
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:45,080
The alien race, have they
heard the word of Christ?!

185
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:46,600
No! Never! It's perfect!

186
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:49,480
Oh, no! Those poor souls! We
must spread the gospel to them!

187
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:50,600
What?!

188
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:54,920
C'mon, Marvin! We gotta get your people
to Marklar before the missionaries do!

189
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:56,607
You'll do nothing of the kind!

190
00:12:56,642 --> 00:12:59,360
This ship is now Property of the
United States Government!

191
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:05,600
Call those boys' mothers!

192
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:09,080
I'm sure they'll be very interested in the
trouble their boys have been up to!

193
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:10,320
Oh, no, dude!

194
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:16,890
You know, Susan, there, there's so
many great missionaries doing work

195
00:13:16,891 --> 00:13:19,471
out there in the,
in the, in parts of Africa

196
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:22,720
nd, and while we're trying to get
bibles to people all over the world,

197
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:26,169
and what we need is the
help of everyone out there

198
00:13:26,170 --> 00:13:29,170
so that we can continue
these, these projects!

199
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:30,120
Now, listen to this, Susan!

200
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:34,760
One of our missionaries in North
Africa has made an amazing discovery!

201
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:40,783
A new planet in the, in the galaxy Alpha-
Seti 6 that has intelligent life on it!

202
00:13:40,818 --> 00:13:41,336
Amazing!

203
00:13:41,361 --> 00:13:44,440
Now, we're not sure what these
hyper-intelligent beings look like,

204
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:48,160
but one thing is for sure, and
they've never heard... of Jesus Christ!

205
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:51,080
What can we do with the 600
club to help those poor aliens?!

206
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:55,520
What we need, Susan, is we need
money to build an Interstellar Cruiser!

207
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:58,320
Now, this spaceship will be able
to travel through a worm hole

208
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:02,600
in deliver the message and glory of
Jesus Christ to those godless aliens!

209
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,920
Send your money now! Amen!

210
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:11,360
I want everyone to keep a safe distance
from the craft until we can run some tests!

211
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:14,360
Uh, excuse me, gentlemen! Uh,
Tom Brokaw is here to see you!

212
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:17,400
Tom Brokaw?! Oh,
no! The press already!

213
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:23,280
- Hey! Good day, gentlemen!
- Mr. Brokaw, I presume!

214
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:24,920
You presume wisely, sir!

215
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:27,160
I'm here to get the big
story! The big scoop!

216
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:30,360
I understand that you've found some
kind of ship from an alien race,

217
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:33,040
seeing as though I am pulitzer
prize winning Tom Brokaw!

218
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:36,400
Look, kid! Did you really think
this was going to fool anybody?!

219
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:40,280
You don't look anything like Tom Brokaw!
- What?! Dare you question my integretah?!

220
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:42,960
I told you Tom Brokaw doesn't
have a mustach, fatass!

221
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:45,480
What?! Eh, oh! I had
some bad bleeters today!

222
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:51,360
Alright, boys! Time to get
back to your quarters!

223
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:54,720
Son of a bitch!

224
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:56,240
Run for it!

225
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:57,267
Get them!

226
00:14:58,268 --> 00:14:59,468
Hey, guys! Wait for me!

227
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:01,960
- Kenny!
- Forget him! He's done for!

228
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:03,580
He's not done for!
He's standing right there!

229
00:15:03,590 --> 00:15:05,600
You, guys! Wait for me!
- No! No! He's done for! C'mon!

230
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:13,120
Dammit, dammit, dammit!

231
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:16,240
Alright! We made it!

232
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:18,600
Okay, Marvin! Time to take
your people to their new home!

233
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:22,120
What was that?!

234
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:25,760
This is the Missionary 600!

235
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:28,560
We have you locked on fire
ready! Turn back right now!

236
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:34,440
- They're shooting at us!
- Quick, Marvin! Get us to Marklar!

237
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:39,520
Well, how'd we do it last time?! - Cartman
just hit the button and the ship flew itself!

238
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:42,920
- Which button did you press,
Cartman?! - Uh, oh! I don't remember!

239
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:43,960
You don't remember?!

240
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:46,120
- You dumbass, Cartman!
- Hey! I was under duress!

241
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,440
Maybe it was this one!

242
00:15:48,197 --> 00:15:52,440
Sauring so high
above the world!

243
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:56,888
The ship seems to made out
of a super-strong alloy!

244
00:15:56,889 --> 00:15:58,389
These lasers aren't
powerful enough!

245
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:01,640
Everyone, the word of God is
going around the world and,

246
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:05,400
and all your help is so
greatly appreciated!

247
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:09,280
W-w-what we need now
is an Argon Crystal Laser!

248
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:12,891
You see, an Argon Crystal Laser
can pierce thick space holes

249
00:16:12,892 --> 00:16:17,480
in a way that other lasers just can't!
Send your money now! Ah, thank you!

250
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:24,333
Miss Struthers, we understand
that you have a ship of your own!

251
00:16:24,334 --> 00:16:26,334
One capable of interstellar travel!

252
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:31,960
We need to use use your
ship to catch those boys!

253
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:33,880
We will do anything
for that technology!

254
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:40,708
Miss Struthers, if those Ethiopians
make it to another planet,

255
00:16:40,709 --> 00:16:43,009
who will send money
to your foundation?!

256
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:46,160
Without Ethiopians,
you have no food!

257
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:53,655
Oh, that won't be a problem,
Miss Struthers! We have collateral!

258
00:16:54,356 --> 00:16:55,656
I wanna get out of here!

259
00:17:01,483 --> 00:17:03,216
I have the infidels in my sight!

260
00:17:05,889 --> 00:17:06,732
Holy shit!

261
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:14,480
Holy crap! They
have photon torpedos!

262
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:18,835
Now, our deflector shields are
useless against four-ton torpedos

263
00:17:18,836 --> 00:17:21,336
and we really need your
support on this one, folks!

264
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:26,160
Here at the 600 club, we need your
money to spread the word of Jesus

265
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:30,040
and build more advanced deflector
shields for our galactic cruiser!

266
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:33,000
Call now and we'll
give you this free pin!

267
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:38,160
- You got'em, Marvin!
- Yeah! Now, finish'em off!

268
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:40,920
Warning! Deflector sheilds failing!

269
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:42,120
Where did that come from?!

270
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:46,240
Good! Now, get them
in our tractor beam!

271
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:49,600
Now we've got'em!

272
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:53,240
It's Sally Struthers!

273
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:57,440
Well, it appears they'll be going back to
Ethiopia! So we can go on to the aliens!

274
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:59,640
Sorry, Marvin! We tried!

275
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:01,760
Wait! Miss Struthers!
Miss Struthers!

276
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:04,720
Miss Struthers, please! Just
listen to me for one second!

277
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:07,440
You started the Feed the Children
Foundation for wonderful reasons!

278
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:09,840
To help starving helpless people who
lived in a rotten part of the world!

279
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,400
Well, it's for those reasons we
wanna help our friend Marvin now!

280
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:19,760
Miss Struthers, don't forget the gift
we gave you! The child in carbonite!

281
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:26,480
Miss Struthers! You
helped so many people,

282
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:28,920
and you taught us that helping
people is what life is all about!

283
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:32,120
All we wanna do is be like you!

284
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:46,840
- She bought it!
- Sally Struthers is saving us!

285
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,280
Uh, now, now stay with
me on this one, folks!

286
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:54,640
Sally Struthers has a Taberian Junker
which is, the favourite ship of the hutts

287
00:18:54,840 --> 00:19:02,760
and she has trapped our, our, our new
CBC ship in a Posetronic Tractor Beam.

288
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:06,280
So we're gonna need an
Ionic Tractor Disruptor!

289
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:09,608
Now, now, not a regular
Ionic Tractor Disruptor,

290
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:14,720
but a Negative Ionic Tractor Disruptor
to help spread the word of Jesus!

291
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:16,440
I will get the
fuckin' idiot up here!

292
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:21,440
- Now's our chance! - Wait! I
remember! It was the red button!

293
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:26,160
They've opened the worm hole!

294
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:27,640
It's pulling us in!

295
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:55,240
Please! Please! Please!
We are confused!

296
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:57,880
You must explain one at a Marklar!

297
00:19:58,040 --> 00:20:02,800
Alien friend, we are here to spread the
word of Jesus! He died for your sins!

298
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:04,480
Who?! Marklar?!

299
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:07,160
We brought Marvin and his people to live
here, but these buttholes followed us!

300
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:08,800
Brought Marklar?!

301
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:10,080
What is Marklar?!

302
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:14,080
Well, Here on Marklar, everyone and
everything is referred to as Marklar!

303
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:17,147
- Doesn't that get confusing?!
- Oh, no! Watch this!

304
00:20:17,182 --> 00:20:20,022
- Hey, Marklar!
- Yes? - You see?!

305
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:23,480
Wait! Wait! I think I can
explain this whole thing!

306
00:20:23,563 --> 00:20:26,440
Marklar, these Marklars
want to change your Marklar!

307
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:28,826
They don't want this Marklar or
any of these Marklars to live here,

308
00:20:28,861 --> 00:20:30,257
because it's bad for their Marklar!

309
00:20:30,258 --> 00:20:33,607
They use Marklar to try and force
Marklars to believe their Marklar!

310
00:20:33,608 --> 00:20:36,608
If you let them stay here, they
will build Marklars and Marklars!

311
00:20:36,703 --> 00:20:39,065
They will take all your Marklars
and replace them with Marklar!

312
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:41,428
These Marklars have no good
Marklar to live on Marklar,

313
00:20:41,463 --> 00:20:43,306
so they must come
here to Marklar!

314
00:20:43,341 --> 00:20:47,560
Please, let these Marklars stay where
they can grow and prosper without any

315
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:49,120
Marklars, Marklars, or Marklars!

316
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:53,440
Young Marklar, your
Marklars are wise and true!

317
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:55,360
What the hell did he say?!

318
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:57,120
- Wow! Good job, dude!
- Thanks!

319
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:58,840
The Marklars can stay!

320
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,320
Alright!

321
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:02,120
You Marklars must leave!

322
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:04,600
But, you will all burn in
forever in eternal hellfire!

323
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:06,720
Yes, that's nice!
Thank you for stopping by!

324
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:09,040
Well, Marvin, It was
sure cool seeing you again!

325
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:13,840
No! We gotta go! Sally Struthers is
gonna give us a ride back to Earth!

326
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:20,520
Maybe we'll come
and visit sometime!

327
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:22,960
Yeah, and maybe Jesse
Jackson'll be president!

328
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:24,920
- Dude! - What?! We're
not gonna come visit him!

329
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:26,960
- I know, but you don't tell
him that! - Whatever!
