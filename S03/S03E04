1
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:42,680
Y'guys! Listen to
this song I just wrote!

2
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:44,480
It's called "I Hate Y'guys!".

3
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:49,229
I hate y'guys!
Y'guys are assholes!

4
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:51,480
Especially Kenny!

5
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:54,560
I hate him the most.

6
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:57,120
Okay, now!
Let's try one altogether!

7
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:58,840
I hate y'guys!

8
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:02,520
C'mon! Y'guys know the
words! Especially Kenny!

9
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:04,120
This is sweet being
rugged outdoorsmen!

10
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:06,600
Facing the wilderness, not
having to be home until 8:30.

11
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:09,840
Where're you goin? - I'm goin home for a
minute! I have to go to the bathroom!

12
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:12,760
- Just go behind the trees!
- I have to go number two!

13
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:14,040
So, you can poo in the wilderness!

14
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:15,960
No way, dude! What
would I wipe with!?

15
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:18,600
Cartman, don't be such a baby! We're
supposed to be rugged outdoorsmen!

16
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:21,160
- What do I sit on?
- You just squat, stupid!

17
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:22,960
Not here! Go further away!

18
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,160
God! I'm glad y'guys know all
these pooping outside rules!

19
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:32,720
Watch out for ground eels!

20
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:36,120
- Shut up, y'guys! I can't think!
- What do you have to think about?

21
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:38,720
I have to think about
planes droping bombs,

22
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:42,800
and dump trucks, and
soft serve ice cream...

23
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:45,500
- Ah! That did it!
- Sick, dude!

24
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:51,360
Pooping outside!

25
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:53,480
Making soft serve ice cream!

26
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,800
For all my friends!
Especially Kenny!

27
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:59,520
Hey, Kenny! Can I
borrow one of your gloves?

28
00:01:59,521 --> 00:02:02,190
Okay! No way!

29
00:02:02,511 --> 00:02:06,280
What the...! - OOMA! KOOGA!
My God, y'guys! Come look at this!

30
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:09,040
- We don't wanna look at it,
Cartman! - Y'guys! Get over hnya!

31
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:11,680
- No way, dude!
- I'm seriously!

32
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:13,760
- Look! Over by those bushes!
- What!?

33
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:15,040
MESO SCARED!

34
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:17,040
I see it!
- C'mon! Let's kill it!

35
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:19,520
Aw, Cartman! You're
supposed to bury it!

36
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:23,560
Look at this sword! Offered only
here on House Shopping network!

37
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:26,240
It's got a dragon on the blade!

38
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:30,900
It's got a dragon painted right on
the blade! Used by the samurai...

39
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:33,400
Ned, how the hell could
you loose your voice box?

40
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:35,760
I Can't hear you, Ned!

41
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:38,520
You don't have a trachea! You
smoke too much, you had it removed!

42
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:41,720
And then, you drank too much and
you lost your goddam voice box, Ned!

43
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:44,000
Shhhut-Up-Jim-Bo!

44
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:46,480
Ah, Ned! Don't burp-talk!
That just sicks me out!

45
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:48,440
- Right this way!
- Over here!

46
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:50,120
What the hell's goin on?

47
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:52,880
Uncle Jimbo, Cartman found some big
animal creature! It ran over that way!

48
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:54,560
Hold on! I'll get my shotgun!

49
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,120
Ned! Ned, c'mon!

50
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:59,960
- Where did it go? - It
just ran by here a second ago!

51
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:02,320
Sounds like it ran into
the ostritch trap!

52
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:05,080
Now, keep quiet!

53
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,760
I'm gonna turn my flashlight on.

54
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:09,520
It may get startled, so be ready!

55
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,200
Holy crow! I've never
seen anything like it!

56
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:19,360
That thing's funny!

57
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:21,880
- It's stupid!
- Well, let's kill it!

58
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:25,770
No! No! Don't!
- Huh? - I like it!

59
00:03:25,805 --> 00:03:27,480
You don't like
anything, Cartman!

60
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:28,840
Well, alright!

61
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:31,200
Ned, get the mayor on
the phone, tell her that we...

62
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:33,640
Yeah, right! You can't talk!
Alright! Never mind! I'll do it!

63
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:37,080
Yeah, it was like wrestling a
Louisiana alligator, this thing!

64
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:38,160
Put up one hell of a fight!

65
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:41,480
Hello, there!

66
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:42,800
Who's the cute baby?

67
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,080
Who's the fuzzy, huh!
Yes, that's a cutie!

68
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,160
Mayor, we're from the
department of interior!

69
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:49,400
Oh, yes! How are you?

70
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:50,840
- Fine! Just fine!
- Fine! Just fine! - Fine!

71
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:52,760
Right over here!

72
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:54,120
My God, McLaghnan!
Do you believe it?

73
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:58,800
- It's amazing!
- What?

74
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:02,560
Mayor, this is a jakovasaur! A
live one has never been seen!

75
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:04,080
Neato!

76
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:07,720
Incredible! We know of this creature
only from remains found frozen in snow!

77
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:11,010
Do you realize what this means?! We
can use its DNA and have a chance

78
00:04:11,011 --> 00:04:14,211
of bringing the entire jackovasaur
species back from extinction!

79
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:15,760
Wow! Cool!

80
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:19,000
Is-there-re-ward-money?

81
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:22,720
Uh, cut it out, Ned!
That's just disgusting!

82
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:25,720
This one jakovasaur can mother
an entire population of the animals.

83
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:29,520
Well, in that case, I think
we should name it...Hope!

84
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:32,360
- Hope!
- Yes! Hope!

85
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:35,560
I think his name is Joon-joon!

86
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:37,880
Hope! Why, that's a
perfectly beautiful name!

87
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:40,080
Now we must find
a safe place for it!

88
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:43,840
I'll keep it at my house! - No, Garrison!
You'll just try to have sex with it!

89
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:47,726
What! How dare you say that!
- Garrison, you remember what

90
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:50,320
happened the wounded pigeon you
were supposed to take care of?

91
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:53,360
Oh, come on! You all know
that pigeon was a total slut!

92
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:56,600
I've got a barn it can stay in!
It ain't much, but it's heated!

93
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:59,455
- Well, that sounds fine! Just
fine! - Fine! Just fine! - Fine!

94
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:01,687
Now, wait a minute!
I wanna clear the air, here!

95
00:05:01,722 --> 00:05:03,700
We all know that
pigeon was a whore!

96
00:05:03,735 --> 00:05:10,664
Raise your hand if you didn't sleep
with that pigeon! Oh, whatever!

97
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:36,000
It's got a dragon painted on the
blade! This is the Sumatomi Sword...

98
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:38,440
Wow! A dragon
right on the blade!

99
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:43,320
Mom! Can I get a Sumatomi Sword
used by the ancient Togagawa soldiers?

100
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:46,160
- I'll think about it, hon!
- Weak!

101
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:49,480
Mom! Somebody's at the door!

102
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:52,840
- Mommy's busy, poopykins!
- Should I get it?

103
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:57,960
Go ahead, snookums! It's
probably one of your little friends!

104
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:02,600
Okay! Okay! Hold your horses!

105
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,760
Mom! It's another
Stark's Pond creature!

106
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,440
That's nice, muffin!

107
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:12,120
PLEASE HELP ME!

108
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:14,960
PLEASE HELP ME
FIND JOON-JOON!

109
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:17,920
SHE HAS BEEN GONE SINCE LIST
NIGHT AND I'M WORRIED SCARED!

110
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:21,200
- You mean the other jakovasaur?
- WHAT MEANS A JAKOVASAUR?

111
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:22,880
You're a jakovasaur!
That's what they call you!

112
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:24,560
OH! COOL NAME!

113
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:26,520
But the other jakovasaur
talked different!

114
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:29,680
THAT'S 'CAUSE JOON-JOON'S A
GIRL! GIRLS TALK DIFFERENTLY!

115
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:31,680
Let's call my friends over!
They're never gonna believe it!

116
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:33,440
PLEASE TAKE ME TO JOON-JOON!

117
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:36,600
WE'RE THE LAST OF OUR KIND!
THERE ARE ONLY TWO OF US LEFT!

118
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:39,840
He's the last of his kind, y'guys!
There's only two of them left!

119
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,823
Did you smoke some
of your mom's crack?

120
00:06:43,824 --> 00:06:46,024
Will you stop with the whole mom
smoking-crack thing?! It's an old joke!

121
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:48,520
ERIC! DO YOU HAVE
ANYMORE COOKIES?

122
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:51,200
- Who's that? One of your mom's
boyfriends? - No! That was a jakovasaur!

123
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:52,200
It's okay to come in!

124
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:55,280
Jakov! I want you
to meet friends!

125
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:58,320
HI, YOU GUYS!
I LOVE NEW FRIENDS!

126
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,040
- Isn't he funny?
- No, he's annoying!

127
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:04,541
What're we
supposed to with him?

128
00:07:04,542 --> 00:07:06,342
We have to take him to that
rancher's barn to see his girlfriend!

129
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:08,881
- Why don't we just tell our parents?
- No! Adults won't understand!

130
00:07:08,882 --> 00:07:10,882
We have to do this ourselves!

131
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,360
Keep quiet! We can get in
big trouble for being here!

132
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:17,880
Keep quiet, stupid!

133
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,680
OH, JOON-JOON!
I'M SO GLAD YOU'RE OKAY!

134
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:22,520
- Dude! Have you ever heard of
whispering? - I AM WHISPERING!

135
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:27,840
- You're so funny, Jakov!
- I AM?!

136
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,160
Ok, uh Jakov, why don't you just take
boonga here and go back to Stark's Pond?

137
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:35,437
OH, I DON'T KNOW! THIS PLACE IS
KINDA NICER THAN STARK'S POND!

138
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:45,214
Hello and welcome to Voice Box Express,

Ah, Jimbo! I can't thank ya
enough for the new voice box!

152
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:22,000
Now, what in the
devil is this, thing!

153
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:25,400
Ah, no! I must've picked up
the Irish model by mistake!

154
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:29,040
What a bloody pickle this is!
Did ya keep the receipt, then?

155
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:31,640
- You guys! Come quick! I've only
just heard! - What?! What is it?!

156
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:34,640
They've found another one!
They've found another jakovasaur!

157
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,960
Nnngg... Blimey!

158
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:43,249
Here with more on the status of the
jakovasaurs is department of interior guy!

159
00:08:43,284 --> 00:08:47,178
Thank you, Mayor! The noble
jakovasaur is on the brink of extinction!

160
00:08:47,213 --> 00:08:49,760
And now, you as a community have
a chance to bring them back!

161
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:52,080
"Thank you, Mayor, for
this distinctive honor..."

162
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:54,000
- What're you doing, fatass?!
- I'm preparing my speech

163
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:56,480
for when they call me up to
congradulate on me on my discovery!

164
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:58,560
"Thank you, Mayor, for
this distinctive honor..."

165
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:00,680
Hope and Jakov are
the last of their kind.

166
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:05,120
But, with the help of the mayor, we have
implemented a plan to help them breed!

167
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:07,360
We will give them a home and
a fighting chance at survival.

168
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,600
Yay for Hope!
- THANK YOU!

169
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:12,200
And now, the little boy who first
discovered the jakovasaurs,

170
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:13,640
Eric Cartman!

171
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:16,800
Thank you, Mayor, for this
honorable distinction! Ahem!

172
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,160
Well, that's about it! Let's go!

173
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:22,440
Ya know, there's really only two season
here in South Park. Winter and July.

174
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:26,840
But I'm seriously! South Park has always
been a place of discovery for me.

175
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:33,560
Hey! You sons of bitches! Get back hnya!
I'm having a goddam distinctive honor!

176
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:36,840
WOW! IT'S SO PRETTY!

177
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:41,320
Well, Jakov, we hope this new
home inspires you and Hope to uh...

178
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:42,680
...hm you know!

179
00:09:44,013 --> 00:09:44,412
WHAT?

180
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:48,438
Well, we'd love to see more jakovasaurs,
so maybe you two should uh...

181
00:09:49,803 --> 00:09:50,257
WHAT?

182
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:52,267
...get to some business! - WHAT?

183
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,000
- THEY WANT YOU TO HAVE
SEX, GODDAMMIT! - OH!

184
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:56,960
We'll just leave you
two lovebirds alone!

185
00:09:57,160 --> 00:10:06,060
ALRIGHT, THEN!

186
00:10:06,095 --> 00:10:14,925
MESA JUS DOWONAH!

187
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:16,360
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO!

188
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:18,680
Jakov, to have sex,
all you need to do is...

189
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:20,360
well, you know... put your...

190
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:25,840
Hmmmm! I guess we don't know
exactly how jakovasaurs mate!

191
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:27,760
There is another option!

192
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:31,480
I've manage to artificially
inseminate Hope with your semen!

193
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:34,160
I HAVE SEAMEN?!
WHERE'S THE BOAT?!

194
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:39,000
Yes! Yes that's
very funny, Jakov!

195
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:42,400
I will need to examine Hope once
more to see if the process worked!

196
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,480
Goddam! Shut up!

197
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:49,520
Yes! Yes! I think it worked!
They're going to be parents!

198
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:50,600
Yeah! - We did it!

199
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:54,040
NOW I CAN BE LIKE ALL THE
OTHER DADS IN SOUTH PARK!

200
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:56,400
Dude, do we really want another one
of these things hangin around?

201
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:58,360
And Bobby Tister is having

202
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:01,360
a great first quarter! Let's see
what trigger he uses here!

203
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:02,720
Here's the snap! And he's...

204
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:05,480
THANKS FOR INVITING ME
TO WATCH THE GAME, GUYS!

205
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:06,720
No problem, Jakov!

206
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:08,240
To the fourty yard line!

207
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:10,320
GO NINERS! NIIINERS!

208
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:12,560
We're rooting for the
Broncos here, Jakov!

209
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:15,680
To Turald Davis! He's at the
fifty! The fourty! The thirty!

210
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:16,920
YOU GUYS KNOW WHAT?!

211
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:20,720
THERE'S ONE TIME! I WAS
WATCHING THIS RABBIT!

212
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:22,240
He breaks another
tackle and the Broncos...

213
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:26,160
YOU GUYS KNOW WHAT... HAPPENED?!
IT TOOK DOOKIE-RED-RADAPIE!

214
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:29,800
Hey, Jakov! Uh, could you run down to
the store and get some more pretzles?

215
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,520
SURE! YOU GOT MONEY?!

216
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:34,601
Here... here you go! And...and don't
go to the store down the block!

217
00:11:34,602 --> 00:11:36,502
The one four miles away in
Fairplay has better pretzles!

218
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:37,960
COOL BEAN!

219
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:39,440
WHOOPSIE! I'LL BE RIGHT BACK!

220
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:42,560
Jakovasaurs kinda
piss me off! Mkay?!

221
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,640
Amazing! The justation
period was only four days!

222
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:52,060
At that rate, we could repopulate
the jakovasaurs in just a few years!

223
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:55,260
Don't worry, Hope! Everything's gonna
be fine! Just fine! - Just fine! - Fine!

224
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:56,760
Dude, I don't wanna watch
this thing have a baby!

225
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:59,480
If Jakov and hope don't have kids,
their race will become extinct!

226
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:01,880
Maybe the baby will be
stale-born like Cartman was!

227
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:04,480
Hey! I might've been stale-born,
but at least I got better!

228
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:05,560
Here we go!

229
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,840
Behold! The miracle
of child-birth!

230
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:11,360
Gross!

231
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:18,840
This is the first step in bringing the
species back from the brink of extinction!

232
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:22,880
- Looks like there maybe a second one!
- That would be a great start for them!

233
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:31,320
She's a cannon!

234
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:34,680
Well, apparently
they breed in litters!

235
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:36,800
Aren't they cute, y'guys?

236
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,400
Dude, I'm not so sure
if this is a good thing!

237
00:12:43,384 --> 00:12:46,273
Okay, children! We have some
new students joining us today!

238
00:12:46,274 --> 00:12:49,274
Let's all be warm and
welcome them to our class!

239
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:50,400
Dude, it's crowded in here!

240
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:52,080
I LIKE SCHOOL!

241
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:57,480
Okay! So we're just gonna stick to our normal
lesson plan and start the day with histor!

242
00:12:58,274 --> 00:13:02,120
Now, does anyone know why Chubby
Checker left the Beatles in 1972?

243
00:13:04,136 --> 00:13:05,880
- Yes!
- I DON'T KNOW!

244
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:09,400
Okay! Is there anybody who
can answer the question?

245
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:11,520
- I CAN'T!
- ME NEITHER!

246
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:13,680
Dammit! Ya don't raise
your hand if you don't know!

247
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:17,360
FIGHT! FIGHT!

248
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:19,120
SCHOOL! SCHOOL! I LIKE SCHOOL!

249
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:21,040
SCHOOL! SCHOOL! I LIKE SCHOOL!

250
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:23,280
This sucks ass!

251
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:26,120
I like going to school now!
Jakovasaurs are so cool!

252
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:30,040
This is insane, Mr. Garrison!
- It sure is, Mr. Hat!

253
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:31,840
Now, folks,

254
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:35,680
I know we're all a little worried about the
jakovasaurs, and I wanna hear you all out!

255
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:40,160
Mayor, the little jakovasaurs are ruining my
classroom! I can't teach our kids anything!

256
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:45,160
And those jakovasaurs eat three times as
much as normal children! I can't keep up!

257
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:48,960
And they're creating more
trash than we can handle too!

258
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:52,895
And what about little
Laura! The Williams' kid!

259
00:13:52,896 --> 00:13:55,896
If she doesn't get that heart
valve operation, she could die!

260
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:59,200
Yeah! Yeah! That's right!

261
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:02,800
Alright, alright! It's obvious be have to do
something, but we can't just make them leave!

262
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,040
e just encourage them
to find some place better!

263
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:08,456
But where?! Jakovasaurs are
big, loud, annoying, and stupid!

264
00:14:08,457 --> 00:14:09,657
Where would they fit in?

265
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:13,990
- Memphis? - Yes! Memphis! You
jakovasaurs would love it there!

266
00:14:14,015 --> 00:14:16,240
I DON'T KNOW! I LIKE
SOUTH PARK A LOT!

267
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:18,200
WHA'DO YOU THINK, HONEY?!

268
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:23,120
But everyone in South Park wishes
they could live in Memphis! Right?

269
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:25,720
Yeah! I'd love to go to Memphis!

270
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:27,400
OKAY! WE'LL MOVE TO MEMPHIS!

271
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,120
Hey, Jakov! How's it going?

272
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:33,080
- GREAT, ERIC! WE'RE MOVING!
- Huh, moving!?

273
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:36,160
ME AND MY FAMILY ARE HEADING
TO THE PROMISED LAND OF MEMPHIS!

274
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:38,520
You can't leave!
You're my friends!

275
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,800
Oh, Eric dear!
It's what's best!

276
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,240
Yeah! Let's get
that luggage packed!

277
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:45,680
Jakov! Please don't go! You
make everything in South Park fun!

278
00:14:45,715 --> 00:14:48,920
You brought life to this whole
town! It would suck without you!

279
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:49,920
IT WOULD?!

280
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:52,840
Yes! These people, Jakov!
These people need you!

281
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,040
I need you!
Please, Jakov! Stay!

282
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:00,880
OKAY! I LIKE SOUTH PARK
BEST OF ALL! WE'RE STAYING!

283
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:03,640
Hooray! Jakov
is staying, y'guys!

284
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:08,120
- Now what do we do? - Don't
worry! We've come up with a plan!

285
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:09,920
- You have?
- Yes! We're leaving!

286
00:15:09,921 --> 00:15:10,845
What?!

287
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:14,160
We're getting the hell out of here
and away from those goddam things!

288
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:15,120
You can't leave!

289
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:16,560
Yes! Who would
take care of them?

290
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:20,160
Little boy, we're making you an
Honorary Department of Interior Person,

291
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:23,800
so now you are officially in charge
of South Park's fish and wildlife!

292
00:15:23,801 --> 00:15:25,801
You have authority
over all of them!

293
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:27,920
I have authoritah?!

294
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:31,680
That's right! And people must respect it!
- Well, that should be fine! Just fine!

295
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:33,280
- Fine! Just fine!
- Fine!

296
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:35,520
Aww, no! Nothing's worse
than Cartman with authoritah!

297
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:36,680
Bye-bye, now!

298
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:44,120
And now, back to
Jakovasaurs on Comedy Central!

299
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:47,360
HI, HONEY! I'M HOME!

300
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:55,160
IT WAS ROUGH AT WORK TODAY!
I'VE NEVER SEEN SO MUCH COFFEE!

301
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:58,520
NO! IN THE BOSS'S LIP!

302
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:02,640
- HELLO, DAD! - HELLO, SON!
HOW WAS YOUR DAY?!

303
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:05,440
OH, NOT SO GOOD! SOMETHING
REALLY STRANGE HAPPENED!

304
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:09,400
WHAT?! YOU MEAN MTV PLAYED
A VIDEO THAT WASN'T WILL SMITH?

305
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:13,880
NO, DAD! A MAN IN A BLUE SUIT
AND AN BAG CAME TO THE DOOR!

306
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:16,560
HE JUST LEFT THIS STILL PIECE
OF PAPER WITH A STAMP ON IT!

307
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:19,600
THAT'S CALLED A MAILMAN!
HE TAKES CARE OF MAIL!

308
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:21,920
OH! HE TOOK CARE OF MOM TOO!

309
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:26,520
YOU'RE A NUT!
LET ME SEE THAT LETTER!

310
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:32,080
IT'S FROM A GAMESHOW! THE
MAYOR HAS INVITED ME TO COMPETE!

311
00:16:32,142 --> 00:16:32,931
Hi, Jakov!

312
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:36,000
What the hell is that?

313
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,080
Who's laughing?

314
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:42,320
THE MAYOR HAS INVITED US TO COMPETE
ON A GAMESHOW IN SOUTH PARK!

315
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:45,440
FIRST PRIZE IS AN ALL
EXPENSE PAID VACATION!

316
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:47,814
Wow! That's cool! I can
help you get ready!

317
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:55,440
C'mon! C'mon!

318
00:16:56,640 --> 00:17:00,000
MAYOR! THIS IS JAKOV! I'M THE
TALL FELLOW DOWN THE BLOCK!

319
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:03,800
Yes, yes, Jakov! You're calling about the
gameshow! Congratualations! Will you do it?

320
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:08,200
SURE! IF A FREE TRIP IS INVOLVED!
CAN MY WHOLE FAMILY GO?!

321
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:09,720
Of course! That's the point!

322
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:12,240
ust be ready this afternoon
at the public access building.

323
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:13,680
And good luck!
Hope you win!

324
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:15,360
COOL! WEEE!

325
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,760
We got him! Alright!

326
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:20,200
The boys here will keep
little Eric Cartman distracted!

327
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,676
Meanwhile, we get rid of the
jakovasaurs and bring some

328
00:17:22,677 --> 00:17:25,677
normalcy back to
this town! Ready?!

329
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,560
Ned! A package came to you
today from Voice Box Express!

330
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:34,080
Oh!- Boy!- Oh!- Boy!

331
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:37,160
- Now remember, Barbrady! All
ya have to do is loose! - Right!

332
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:39,520
Okay, let's quiet down,
people and jakovasaurs!

333
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:43,526
Now, as you know, the winner of this
little game will get an all expense

334
00:17:43,530 --> 00:17:47,600
paid trip for himself and fifty of his
closest relatives to lovely France!

335
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:52,560
And, all one of you lucky contestants has
to do is answer only one of these questions!

336
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:53,920
Are you ready, players?!

337
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:55,240
- Ready!
- READY!

338
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:57,880
- Okay! Hands on
your buzzers! - 47!

339
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:02,256
- You have to wait until I ask
the question first! - SORRY!

340
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:04,600
- That's okay! Hands on buzzers!
- TURKEY SANDWICH!

341
00:18:04,610 --> 00:18:05,812
Damn! He's quick!

342
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:07,760
- OH, SORRY!
- I'm sorry!

343
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:10,960
- NO! IT'S MY FAULT!
- No! It's all me! My bad!

344
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,960
Will somebody please
unplug the goddam buzzers!

345
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:15,800
Got it!

346
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,040
Now, can we get on with this?!

347
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:20,080
First Question,
what color is blue?

348
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:21,640
- Blue?
- What?!

349
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:23,240
Blue is blue?

350
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:24,600
AWW! DID I LOOSE?

351
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:26,800
What? Loose?
No, no! Hang on!

352
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,400
You're supposed to
loose, you idiot!

353
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:31,323
- Where am I? - Just don't
answer anymore questions! Got it?!

354
00:18:31,358 --> 00:18:32,139
Okee Dokee!

355
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:35,000
Sorry, folks! A little mix up!
We're playing best out of three!

356
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:38,040
What're we doing out here y'guys? I
wanna see if Jakov wins that gameshow!

357
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:39,120
Oh, he'll win! Don't worry!

358
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:41,249
We just have to show you this
new species, because you're the

359
00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:43,760
department of interior guy, now!
Soon, they'll all be eaten by bears!

360
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:46,680
Ah! Let me get out my notepad so
I can classify this new species!

361
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:49,040
hat should be fine!
Just fine! Just fine! Fine!

362
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:51,720
There it is! That must be
of the antelope family!

363
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:54,240
That's Kenny with
branches on his head!

364
00:18:55,653 --> 00:18:57,360
Why did you bring me all
the way out here, y'guys?

365
00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:00,520
Cartman, jakovasaurs are making South
Park suck! You have to understand that!

366
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:02,960
What does that have to do
with me being all the way out...

367
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:07,040
Wait a minute! You're distracting
me! That gameshow is a fix!

368
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:08,166
Cartman, wait!

369
00:19:08,201 --> 00:19:09,201
Hey, guys! What about me?!

370
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:14,360
- What's two plus two, Jakov?
- I DON'T KNOW!

371
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:15,760
Four?

372
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:18,080
Jakov, what is your name?

373
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:21,320
Jakov.

374
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:23,440
Oh, screw it! Jakov wins!

375
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:24,600
I DO?!

376
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:30,400
You and your entire family are going
to wonderful and exotic France!

377
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:33,200
Alright, everybody! Let's
get them to the airport!

378
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:36,400
Let's go people!
There's no time to loose!

379
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:41,640
BUT WHAT ABOUT OUR CLOTHES?!
SHOULDN'T WE PACK FIRST?!

380
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:43,850
Jakovasaurs don't
wear clothes, Jakov!

381
00:19:43,851 --> 00:19:47,800
OH, YEAH! WELL, GOODBYE EVERYBODY!
WE'LL SEND STUFF FROM FRANCE!

382
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:54,560
- Close the doors!
- Open this door!

383
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:55,880
Eric, this is for the best!

384
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:58,960
I am department of interior
guy and I have authoritah!

385
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:02,520
Noo! Jakov! Don't go!

386
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:06,320
HI, ERIC! I CAN'T FIND IT!

387
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:09,440
Come back!

388
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:16,120
Eric, it's important for
you to understand!

389
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:17,560
No, mother! Just don't!

390
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,640
I know it's hard, Eric! But
I've learned something today!

391
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:24,160
You see, animal species come and
go! It's all a part of natural evolution!

392
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:27,120
The jackovasaurs would've gone
extinct if we hadn't interfered,

393
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:29,880
becasue their particular form
of life simply wasn't practical!

394
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:32,960
We can't go around
saving every form of life

395
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:34,560
anymore than
we can kill them all!

396
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:36,840
We have to let
nature run its course!

397
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:40,440
Ned, that voice box sucks!

398
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:42,840
I know! I'm still trying
to find my old one!

399
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:45,480
Well then, let's say we
all go get some ice cream!

400
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,920
That's okay! I'll see y'guys!

401
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:52,440
Dude! I've never seen Cartman
care so much about something!

402
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:55,760
Yeah! I guess he finally found
something that's as annoying as he is!

403
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:07,600
C'MON, KIDS! LET'S
GO FIND THE PYRAMIDS!



9999
