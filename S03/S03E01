1
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:37,080
Ok children we have
a special guest today,

2
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:40,200
a woman recruiting young
people for a national choir tour.

3
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:42,920
Now I know that choir tours
are totally stupid and lame,

4
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:45,320
but please give
her your full attention.

5
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:48,160
- Go ahead.
- Uh, thank you Mr. Garrison.

6
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:50,200
How are we all doing, today?

7
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:54,520
I can't hear you!
I said how are we all doing?

8
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:58,320
Eric Cartman, you say excuse me!

9
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:00,190
Go ahead.

10
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:03,800
Children, we're a national
choir called Getting Gay with Kids.

11
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:06,295
We're gonna do a big tour
down in Central America

12
00:01:06,299 --> 00:01:09,400
to help save the rainforest
and you can be a part of it.

13
00:01:09,901 --> 00:01:11,401
This is fuckin stupid!

14
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:14,160
Kenny McCormick, you
speak when you're spoken to!

15
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:16,560
Go ahead.

16
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:19,980
You see, we take kids from all over
the country and put them in a choir,

17
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,520
where they sing and dance to raise
awareness about our vanishing rainforests.

18
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:26,800
Did you know over ten thousand acres
of rainforest are bulldozed every year?

19
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:31,040
That's right and over thirty percent of the
world's oxygen is made in the rainforests.

20
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:34,040
So who wants to join the fun?

21
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:36,040
- What if you don't have
any rhythm? - Excuse me?

22
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:39,200
- Like my friend Kyle. He's Jewish, so he
doesn't have any rhythm. - Shut up, fatass!

23
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:41,680
Choirs suck! - Kyle Broflofsky,
you watch your language!

24
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:44,840
Eric Cartman, you be nice to people!
Stan Marsh, you mind your manners!

25
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:47,000
Kenny McCormick,
you pay attention!

26
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:50,040
- Go ahead.
- Well that's all really.

27
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:52,760
So if anyone is interested
in seeing the rainforest

28
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:55,240
and joining our choir, I'll leave
information packets up front.

29
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:57,340
Oh, that's good. We need
some more toilet paper.

30
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:59,480
Alright! That does it!

31
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:02,560
I am tired of seeing you
in my office, young man.

32
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:05,640
You get sent here
every day, Craig. - I know.

33
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:08,360
- Why can't you behave?
- I don't know.

34
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:10,240
What do you have
to say for yourself?

35
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:13,320
Well I'll tell you
what young man,

36
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,880
you're gonna be held
back a grade if you don't...

37
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,840
- Did you just flip me off?
- No.

38
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,760
Yes you did! You just
flipped me the bird!

39
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:22,160
Now see, this is exactly
what I'm talking about!

40
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:24,640
If you don't shape up, mmmkay,
and get your head straight...

41
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:26,800
- There! You just flipped
me off again! - No I didn't.

42
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:29,592
Yes you did! And until
you stop flipping people off,

43
00:02:29,593 --> 00:02:32,440
you can just go back to the
waiting room, mmmkay! Next!

44
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:34,360
Well well well.

45
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:36,360
If it isn't Stan, Kyle,
Kenny, and Eric?

46
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:39,000
- Hi Craig. - Hey, don't
flip me off, you sonofabitch!

47
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:42,800
Sit down boys. Now let's see, what
did Mr. Garrison send you in here for?

48
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:45,221
"The boys were being rude
while a choir teacher

49
00:02:45,222 --> 00:02:47,222
was giving some
stupid presentation."

50
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:49,240
It's just some dumb
activist kids choir thing!

51
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:52,360
Young man, Getting Gay with
Kids is not dumb, mmmkay!

52
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:54,800
It just so happens that I'm
on the board of directors.

53
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:56,378
Dude, all those choirs are the same.

54
00:02:56,379 --> 00:02:58,679
They don't even really sing.
They use prerecorded tapes.

55
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:02,200
Well guess what boys, I think Getting
Gay with Kids is just what you need.

56
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:04,080
I'm gonna sign
up all four of you.

57
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:05,720
- What?
- You can't do that!

58
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:10,360
I think this will be
very good for you.

59
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:12,040
But we don't even care
about the rainforests.

60
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:14,760
And that's exactly why
you need to go, mmmkay.

61
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:16,533
Please, Mr. Mackie,
we'll be good,

62
00:03:16,534 --> 00:03:20,004
don't send us to that old kid
choir, have mercy Mr. Mackie.

63
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:24,240
Be safe Kyle. Bring me
something back from the rainforest.

64
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:26,440
Oh no no no. The
rainforest is very fragile.

65
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:29,520
We must take only pictures
and leave only footprints.

66
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:30,840
Oh, I didn't realize.

67
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,089
Did you know that
right now bulldozers

68
00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:35,890
are tearing down thousands
of acres of rainforest everyday?

69
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:38,720
Ah man, this is gonna
suck donkey balls!

70
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,880
Please don't make me go
on a choir tour, mom, please!

71
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:44,820
Stan, you should be excited. I
would love to see the rainforest.

72
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:46,600
Besides, your dad and
I need some time alone.

73
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:47,720
No!

74
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,840
Okay children,
that's all of us.

75
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,560
We're ready to head to the
Latin American nation of Costa Rica,

76
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:59,200
a country filled with
virgin rainforests.

77
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:03,880
And you must be Eric Cartman.
I've heard about you.

78
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:06,320
You don't respect nature
or other cultures.

79
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:07,720
Yeah, pretty much.

80
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:10,200
Well I'm gonna change
the way you think kiddo.

81
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:12,960
My name is Kelly.
- My name is Kenny.

82
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:14,480
Lenny?
- No, Kenny!

83
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:15,960
Johnny?
- KENNY!

84
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,000
Now we've got a
long trip ahead of us,

85
00:04:18,020 --> 00:04:21,000
so let's take the opportunity
to learn our choreography.

86
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:22,680
The nightmare begins.

87
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,940
Look children, I think we're entering San
Jose, which is the capital of Costa Rica.

88
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:39,240
Oh this is so exciting!

89
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:42,160
Oh my God, dude, look how
dirty and crappy everything is.

90
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:45,200
Eric, Costa Rica is a
third world country.

91
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:47,800
These people are much
poorer than those in the US.

92
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:49,360
Well why the hell
don't they get jobs?

93
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:53,115
Hey why don't you people
quit slacking off and get a job?

94
00:04:53,116 --> 00:04:55,840
What's wrong with you?
Go to college. - Eric, sit down!

95
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:57,720
Look, you gotta be
firm with these people

96
00:04:57,721 --> 00:04:59,921
or they just slack off and be
poor forever, right Kenny?

97
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:02,820
Hey, maybe that's it, Kenny,
maybe you're Costa Rican,

98
00:05:02,821 --> 00:05:05,221
that's why your family is so
poor. - You fuckin asshole!

99
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:06,640
Your family isn't poor?

100
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:08,400
Whoa dude, look over there!

101
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:10,480
Wow, Costa Rican prostitutes!

102
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:12,360
Hey, look at the
prostitutes you guys!

103
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:19,520
- What are you looking at, man?
- Yeah, why don't you take a picture?

104
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:20,840
Okay.

105
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:23,240
Eric, sit down!

106
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:27,480
Kids, this is the Costa
Rican capital building.

107
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:30,680
This is where all the leaders of the
Costa Rican government make their...

108
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:32,680
Oh my God, it smells
like ass out here!

109
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:33,840
Alright, that does it!

110
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,360
Eric Cartman, you respect
others cultures this instant!

111
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:39,920
I wasn't saying anything about their culture,
I was just saying there city smells like ass.

112
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:43,960
Wow! Seeing a place like this makes
you appreciate living in America, huh?

113
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:48,320
You may think that making fun of third
world countries is funny but let me...

114
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:50,939
I don't think it's funny! This place
is overcrowded, smelly, and poor!

115
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:53,439
That's not funny, that sucks!
- Eric, will you please, PLEASE,

116
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:57,080
keep your mouth shut while we present
ourselves to the Costa Rican President.

117
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:00,320
- Why? - Cause I'll buy you some
ice cream afterwards if you do.

118
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:04,160
Well, it was a very long trip, but the
children are very excited to sing tomorrow.

119
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:06,720
Que?

120
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:10,800
Uh, we're the choir that was
sent from the United States.

121
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:13,080
Que?

122
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:16,920
We're the group singing for the
save the rainforest summit tomorrow.

123
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:21,160
Oh dear, where's Mr. Mackie?
He should have been here by now.

124
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:22,840
Children, do any of
you speak Spanish?

125
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:26,120
- Don't you dare!
- Sorry I'm late.

126
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:29,280
Oh, thank goodness you're here, I don't
speak any Spanish. - Oh no problem.

127
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:32,400
Ustedas choir de estados
unidos, mmmbien?

128
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,560
Oh, oh, save the rainforest.

129
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:40,640
Uh, he says Pablo here will
take you on a rainforest tour.

130
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:44,480
Oh boy! Mr. Presidente,
round up your subjects outside.

131
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:48,400
We have a special gift
for you, the gift of song.

132
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:54,120
Alright children, let's get in our
rows quickly so we can begin.

133
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:57,420
Did you remember all the
choreography, Lenny? - Yeah, I think so.

134
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:00,520
Hello everybody. This is just a
little rehearsal for tomorrow,

135
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:02,420
so we may be a little rusty.

136
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:10,600
There's a place that is
magical and full of rain,

137
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:14,040
but now it needs
help because it is in pain.

138
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:17,200
Cleaning the earth
is a mighty big chore.

139
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:20,640
We're spreading awareness
like never before.

140
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:25,400
Getting Gay with Kids is here.

141
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:28,360
Spread the word
and bring you cheer.

142
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:32,040
Let's save the
rainforest, what do you say?

143
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:35,520
Being an activist is totally gay.

144
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:40,200
And someday if we work
hard, boys and girls,

145
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:47,480
they'll be nothing but rainforest
covering the entire world.

146
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:51,920
Getting Gay with Kids is here.

147
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,400
Spread the word
and bring you cheer.

148
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:59,480
Getting Gay with Kids is here.

149
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:03,720
Save the rainforest,
totally gay, totally gay!

150
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:08,480
Great job, gang!

151
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:10,845
- You were really all over
the place, Kyle. - Thanks.

152
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:13,360
- I told you Jewish people don't
have rhythm! - Fuck off, Cartman!

153
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:17,880
No, dude, I think Cartman might actually
be right! - No, that's a stereotype.

154
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:20,800
Dude, maybe you really
don't have any rhythm!

155
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:27,040
Now, secondary
rainforest we are entering.

156
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:28,900
Notice the canopy of foliage.

157
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:31,800
Oh! It's everything I've
ever dreamed it would be!

158
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:33,000
God damn, it's hot out here!

159
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:34,480
Ah! Snake!

160
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,200
No, dude, that's a branch.

161
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:37,320
Oh... Ah! Snake!

162
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:39,120
No, that's the same branch again.

163
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:43,480
The rainforest is very delicate and
we must take steps to protect it.

164
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:45,760
Yeah yeah yeah, take steps,
we're taking them, blah blah blah.

165
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:49,080
We heard this a million
times back up in the states.

166
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:51,000
Here look!
These are squirrel monkeys,

167
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:53,520
endangered inhabitants
of the rainforest.

168
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:55,320
Wow! Isn't he neat, Lenny?

169
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:56,760
Bad! Bad monkey!

170
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:58,440
Eric! What the
hell are you doing?

171
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:00,560
I'm asserting myself.
It's tough love.

172
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:02,496
Just like my little Kitty.
When he's bad, I'll say:

173
00:09:02,497 --> 00:09:05,497
"that's a bad little Kitty"
and I smack him on the head.

174
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,840
And here is a three-toed sloth.

175
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,720
That's a bad... That's a
bad three-toed sloth!

176
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:11,480
Eric! For God's sake,
knock it off!

177
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:13,440
Respect my autoritay!

178
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:16,720
Well Mr. Pedro, this was a great tour,
but I guess we should be heading back,

179
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:19,760
we have a big concert
tomorrow, don't we kids?

180
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:23,120
- I wish we could have seen the
Yanagapa. - What's the Yanagapa?

181
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:26,320
The Yanagapa are gentle native
people that live in the rainforest,

182
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:29,960
but bulldozers are destroying their homes.
Soon they will have nowhere to go,

183
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:32,520
so we must stop bulldozing the
rainforest so that they can live...

184
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,720
God, here she goes again!

185
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:37,520
- Stanley, what is it?
- Snake!

186
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:40,760
Ah, yes, this is what
we call a coral snake.

187
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:43,120
Notice the red markings.
Quite an amazing creature.

188
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:45,360
What's the matter little boy?

189
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:48,000
- He's a little wuss, what's it look
like? - I'm just scared of snakes.

190
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:52,120
Now, now. You must remember, this snake
is more afraid of you than you are of it.

191
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,240
Oh my God!

192
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:01,120
Oh yeah. That snake is
really scared of us, alright.

193
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:04,480
Jesus Christ, is he dead?

194
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:07,520
My guess would be yes.

195
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:09,880
Oh no! God, no!
Now, don't panic children!

196
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:13,000
Bad! That's a bad snake!

197
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,360
Maybe we came from that way.

198
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:19,520
No, no, let's try this way.

199
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:23,440
Benny, do you think we're gonna
be okay? - Yeah, everything is fine.

200
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:25,660
That's good. Can I tell
you something? - Okay.

201
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:27,510
I think I like you.
- Really?

202
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:30,960
Yeah. I mean, I think we communicate
really well. - Oh! That's great!

203
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:32,940
No, it's not good.
- That's not good?

204
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:36,240
No. See, if I start to like you too much,
I'm only gonna get my heart broken,

205
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:38,000
'cause we like on
opposite ends of the country.

206
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:40,440
Once this choir tour is over, we
will never see each other again.

207
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:42,027
And that would devastate me!

208
00:10:42,028 --> 00:10:45,028
So I can't have any feelings
for you, I just can't, Lenny!

209
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:49,480
Oh children, the sun is setting. We
have to find our way out of here quick!

210
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:59,320
Okay, Okay!
Everything is just fine kids.

211
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:02,040
Now, it is important that
we all stick together.

212
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:04,240
Is everybody still here?

213
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:07,000
- I'm not.
- Who's not?

214
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:08,200
Me.

215
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:10,800
Benny, will you hold my hand.

216
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:13,480
I don't wanna get
emotionally attached, though.

217
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:15,560
Oh my God, dude!
I just saw Tony Danza!

218
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:18,080
No, you didn't just see
Tony Danza, Stanley!

219
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:01,750
Dude, we're totally lost.
We're gonna die out here!

220
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:04,496
- We are?! - Don't worry Kelly,
we're gonna find our way out

221
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:07,080
of the rainforest and make
it back to the concert in time.

222
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:11,280
We just need to respect our mother
rainforest and she will respect us.

223
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:13,080
Mrs. Stevens. You have
a bug on your back.

224
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:14,920
Really? Could
you brush it off?

225
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:17,620
Uh, No.

226
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,000
Oh my God! Get it off me!

227
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:23,800
For the love of God!
Get it off me! Oh my God!

228
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:26,960
Okay children,
we must understand

229
00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:31,440
that the insects of the rainforest
help the delicate balance of life here.

230
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:35,840
- Rainforests suck,
I wanna go home! - Me too!

231
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:42,880
Children, Okay! Let's try to listen
to what the rainforest tells us,

232
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:46,560
and if we use our ears, she
can tell us so many things...

233
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:47,880
There's a dude here!

234
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:49,920
Ah thank goodness! Hello sir!

235
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:52,600
We are lost!
Can you help us?

236
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Que?

237
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:56,200
Let me try. Let me try.

238
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:58,720
We are from America,
A-mer-i-ca.

239
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:00,880
We are lost and very hungry.

240
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:02,800
Neccesito burrito...

241
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:04,760
I don't wanna burrito,
I wanna taco. Supreme.

242
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:07,320
- Y taco... - I want two
tostados in mild sauce.

243
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:10,240
Two tostados in... en charida.

244
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:13,720
Boys! Please! Not every Spanish person
eats tacos and burritos, that's a stereotype.

245
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:16,840
Children, he wants us to follow him.

246
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,160
Oh, thank goodness!
I think this ordeal is over!

247
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:25,360
- This doesn't look very safe. - Yeah, I
think we should get the hell out of here.

248
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:28,351
Now kids, let's be a bit more open
minded. I read all about this in Newsweek,

249
00:13:28,352 --> 00:13:31,786
I read all about this in Newsweek,
this is a people's army,

250
00:13:31,790 --> 00:13:34,800
they're fighting the fascist policies
of their fascist government.

251
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:38,560
- Oh, hello! Do you speak English?
- Who are you?

252
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:43,160
Oh wonderful! We were lost and it is a
such a great coincidence we found you!

253
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:46,320
You see, we're here to protest the
government sanction raping of your rainforest.

254
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:51,400
We are fighters just like you! Could
you help us get back to San Jose?

255
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:55,420
Um, I know! Perhaps
you would like a gift.

256
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:59,720
I have only one gift
to give. The gift of song.

257
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:06,920
There's a place that is
magical and full of rain...

258
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:09,960
Kyle, for the love of God,
do the right choreography.

259
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:13,800
Cleaning the earth
is a mighty big chore.

260
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:16,720
We're spreading
awareness like never before.

261
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:18,880
Oh, Kyle! Please!

262
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:21,960
Getting Gay with Kids is here...

263
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:22,800
Enough!

264
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:25,920
Well, we hope our gift of
song has warmed your hearts.

265
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:28,520
We're not getting gay
with any kids, okay!

266
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:31,240
Uh, yeah. So, do you
have a phone we could use?

267
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:35,560
Yes, we have a phone. It's right over
there, next to the twelve person jacuzzi.

268
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:40,960
Now, get out of
here before we kill you.

269
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:44,320
Is it because of the little
Jewish boy's choreography?

270
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:46,520
You white Americans make me sick!

271
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:49,440
You waste food, oil, and everything
else, because you are so rich.

272
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:50,972
And then you tell
the rest of the world

273
00:14:50,973 --> 00:14:53,973
to save the rainforest because
you like it's pretty flowers.

274
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:02,560
Run! Children! Run!

275
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:23,520
Hello! Anybody?! Help!

276
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:25,120
Wow! Look at the pretty flower!

277
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:28,640
Oh, no, no, no, Jake that
fragile flower is very delicate, okay.

278
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:35,320
I wanna go home!
I hate the rainforest!

279
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:40,840
Oh, Lenny, hold me!
No, I can't get attached.

280
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:42,600
Oh, but I do like you.

281
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:44,940
Oh, but you're only going
to leave me. - God damn it!

282
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:49,309
We're here live in San Jose, Costa
Rica, where hundreds of rich Americans

283
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:51,580
have gathered for the
Save the Rainforest Summit.

284
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:53,505
Everyone is here so they can
feel good about themselves

285
00:15:53,506 --> 00:15:56,506
and act like they aren't the ones
responsible for the rainforest's peril.

286
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:59,680
That's right, Bob, and of course
the main attraction today

287
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:02,280
the darling kids choir,
Getting Gay with Kids,

288
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:05,280
all of whom must be backstage
preparing at this very moment.

289
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:10,480
Oh, there's just no end to this place!
I think maybe we're going in circles.

290
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:13,760
Oh! Dear God! The summit starts
in an hour! I'm gonna lose my job.

291
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:17,640
This is bullcrap! I am not following
this stupid hippie around anymore!

292
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:19,760
- Eric, where are you going?
- I'm going this way.

293
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:23,160
Young man, I am the adult here,
and I say you go this way!

294
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:26,560
Look, you can stay over myah,
but I'm going over myah.

295
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,400
Young man, I have had it!

296
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:30,640
No no no no no no! You myah.

297
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:33,800
Screw you
guys, I'm going home.

298
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:36,920
Good! You deserve to
die, you little bastard!

299
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:39,440
Eric, we have to stay together!

300
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:42,909
God damn stupid hippie activist!
I should be home, nestled in the couch

301
00:16:42,910 --> 00:16:46,040
with my little Kitty right now,
watching Fat Abbot cartoons and...

302
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:49,440
Yes! I knew it! I'm saved!

303
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:52,160
- Hey, maybe Cartman was right.
- Yeah, it happened once before.

304
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:55,960
No, the spirit of Maya has
told me to go this way.

305
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:57,840
Mister, you gotta help me,
I'm starvin' to death!

306
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,200
What are you
doing here, little boy?

307
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:01,158
I was with my class, and we
got all lost in the rainforest,

308
00:17:01,159 --> 00:17:02,859
and I need some
food, I'm fading fast!

309
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:05,560
Lost in the rainforest? Oh my
Lord! Where are all the others?

310
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:07,960
Food! I have to have food!

311
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:11,400
Oh my God! Get this
child some food quick!

312
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:13,600
- Chicken wings.
- Chicken wings!

313
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:14,640
Medium spicy.

314
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:18,560
Start the show! Start
the show! Start the show!

315
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:50,440
Oh God, this is a nightmare! We're
never gonna make the festival!

316
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:52,000
Hey look over there!
Isn't that smoke?

317
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:54,560
Let's go, quickly!

318
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:57,680
Hey, it's a fire. That
means there must be people.

319
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:02,800
Children! It's the Yanagapa!

320
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:06,880
Do not be afraid. We are not
here to tear down your rainforest.

321
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:12,200
Look how they live in
peace with all living things,

322
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:13,640
gentle, noble...

323
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:16,280
Run for you lives, children!

324
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:17,440
Holy crap!

325
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:20,520
Jesus Christ!

326
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:22,040
Run! Run! Run!

327
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:31,760
- What the hell?
- We're sinking!

328
00:18:31,795 --> 00:18:33,680
It's quicksand!

329
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:43,030
All we ever heard
while growing up was:

330
00:18:43,031 --> 00:18:44,311
"save the rainforest",
" the rainforest is fragile".

331
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:45,860
Yeah, fragile my ass!

332
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:48,520
Larry, if we make it out of this,
I want to be your girlfriend,

333
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:52,240
even if we do live in different
places. I don't care. - Oh, okay.

334
00:18:56,160 --> 00:19:00,040
Okay, just what the hell
is going on here, people?

335
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:13,040
Oh no! That big thing is going
to make love to Miss Stevens!

336
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:17,400
Alright! That does it! God
damn stupid-ass rainforest!

337
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:19,280
This stupid place fuckin sucks!

338
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:20,700
I was wrong!

339
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:23,520
Fuck the rainforest! I fuckin
hate it! I fuckin hate it!

340
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:25,120
Oh now she figures it out!

341
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:27,540
Quick! Everybody help the children!

342
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:39,480
Dude! Bulldozers rule!

343
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:41,720
Come on, let's get you
back to civilization.

344
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:44,000
Hooray! Children!

345
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:46,880
- How did you know where we were?
- Your little friend helped me out.

346
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:48,900
- Eric? - Who'd you
expect? Merv Griffin?

347
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:52,640
Exactly what are you guys doing out
here with all this construction equipment?

348
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:55,720
We're clearing out big sections of
the rainforest for a lumber yard.

349
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:58,640
- Really? That's great!
- You mean, you don't mind?

350
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:00,520
No! I hate the rainforest!

351
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:03,280
You go right ahead and plough
down this whole fuckin thing!

352
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:04,280
That's swell!

353
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:07,040
Okay, Benny, in order for our
long distance relationship to work,

354
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:09,960
we'll have to call each other every
other day. - Okay. I can do that.

355
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:14,900
Lenny! No!

356
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,760
- Oh my God! They killed Kenny!
- You bastards!

357
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:20,040
What!? Who!?
Who killed him!?

358
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:23,040
- They did.
- Who's "they"!?

359
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:27,040
- You know... "they".
- They're... they're bastards.

360
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:28,960
Well don't just stand
there! Help him!

361
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:30,680
- What?
- Help... him?

362
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,280
Come on Benny, breathe!

363
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:38,280
Breathe
you sonofabitch!

364
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:43,200
Whoa, dude!

365
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:49,700
And now, here to teach us about the
rainforest is... Getting Gay with Kids.

366
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:51,920
Does everybody
remember the new lyrics?

367
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:59,440
There a place called the
rainforest that truly sucks ass.

368
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:02,720
Lets knock it all down
and get rid of it fast.

369
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:06,040
You say "save the
rainforest" but what do you know?

370
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:10,920
You've never
been there before.

371
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:14,440
Getting Gay with Kids is here

372
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:17,680
tell you things you
might not like to hear.

373
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,040
You only fight these
causes 'cause caring sells.

374
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:24,560
All you activists can
go fuck yourselves.

375
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:27,280
- That was so inspiring!
- What a wonderful message!
