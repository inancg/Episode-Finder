Fighting the frizzies at eleven!

3
00:00:07,925 --> 00:00:13,839
We've all heard of Rudolph and his
shiny nose, and we all know Frosty

4
00:00:13,907 --> 00:00:16,020
who's made out of snow!

5
00:00:16,125 --> 00:00:21,053
But, all of those stories seem kind
of gay, 'cause we all know

6
00:00:21,083 --> 00:00:25,026
who brightens up our holiday!

7
00:00:30,309 --> 00:00:32,663
Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo!

8
00:00:33,013 --> 00:00:35,045
Small and brown, he comes from you!

9
00:00:35,474 --> 00:00:37,586
Sit on the toilet! Here he comes!

10
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:39,812
Squeeze him 'tween your festive buns!

11
00:00:40,162 --> 00:00:43,600
A present from down below
spreading joy with a...

12
00:00:43,627 --> 00:00:44,642
Howdy Ho!

13
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:47,224
He's seen the love inside of you,
'cause...

14
00:00:47,261 --> 00:00:48,851
He's a piece of poo!

15
00:00:49,487 --> 00:00:51,677
Sometimes, he's nutty!
Sometimes he's corny!

16
00:00:51,729 --> 00:00:53,617
He can be brown or greenish-brown!

17
00:00:53,748 --> 00:00:54,200
Mm, mm!

18
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:58,257
But, if you eat fibre on Christmas Eve,
he might come to your town!

19
00:00:58,588 --> 00:01:00,805
Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo!

20
00:01:00,925 --> 00:01:05,686
He loves me! I love you! Therfore,
vicariously, he loves you!

21
00:01:05,761 --> 00:01:07,630
I can make a Mr. Hankey too!

22
00:01:08,226 --> 00:01:13,200
Howdy ho! I'm Mr. Hankey,
the Christmas Poo!

23
00:01:13,381 --> 00:01:18,000
Santa's greetings to all of you!
Let's sing songs and dance and play,

24
00:01:18,098 --> 00:01:22,242
now before I melt away!
Here's a game I like to play!

25
00:01:22,694 --> 00:01:24,792
Stick me in your mouth and try to say...

26
00:01:25,075 --> 00:01:27,300
Howdy Ho Ho, yum, yum, yum!

27
00:01:27,397 --> 00:01:29,600
Christmas time has come!

28
00:01:29,621 --> 00:01:30,700
Sometimes he's runny!

29
00:01:30,795 --> 00:01:31,949
Sometimes he's firm!

30
00:01:31,990 --> 00:01:34,200
Sometimes he's practically water!

31
00:01:34,291 --> 00:01:38,200
Sometimes he hangs of the end
of your ass and won't fall in the toilet,

32
00:01:38,237 --> 00:01:41,123
'cause he's just clinging to your
sphinkter, and he won't drop off,

33
00:01:41,145 --> 00:01:43,700
and so you shake your ass around,
try to get 'im to drop in the toilet,

34
00:01:43,768 --> 00:01:44,781
and finally it does!

35
00:01:45,786 --> 00:01:49,162
Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo!

36
00:01:49,376 --> 00:01:51,467
Christmas leaves! He must leave too!

37
00:01:51,722 --> 00:01:55,860
Flush him down, but he's never gone!

38
00:01:56,301 --> 00:02:01,138
His smell and his spirit lingers on!

39
00:02:03,635 --> 00:02:05,091
Howdy ho!

40
00:02:07,908 --> 00:02:12,200
Howdy ho, folks! We're gonna do
something a little bit different tonight!

41
00:02:12,255 --> 00:02:15,108
Instead of our normal thing,
we're just gonna sit back and

42
00:02:15,122 --> 00:02:19,627
enjoy some holiday songs!
And, if you don't like it, well,

43
00:02:19,636 --> 00:02:22,007
I guess you can suck my tiny
little balls!

44
00:02:22,544 --> 00:02:25,239
So let's start off with a festive
Hanukkah song,

45
00:02:25,653 --> 00:02:29,348
sung by my favourite jewish
person in the whole world!

46
00:02:30,692 --> 00:02:33,800
Okay, Ike! You're my little brother,
so I have to show you how to

47
00:02:33,804 --> 00:02:35,087
celebrate Hanukkah!

48
00:02:35,095 --> 00:02:36,041
This is called a dreidel!

49
00:02:36,475 --> 00:02:38,986
You spin it and see where
it lands and you sing this song!

50
00:02:39,456 --> 00:02:41,325
I have a little dreidel!

51
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:42,907
I made it out of clay!

52
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:46,181
And when it's dry and ready,
with dreidel, I shall play!

53
00:02:46,511 --> 00:02:47,836
Oh, dreidel, dreidel dreidel!

54
00:02:48,146 --> 00:02:49,332
I made you out of clay!

55
00:02:49,883 --> 00:02:51,112
Dreidel, dreidel dreidel!

56
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:52,573
With dreidel, I shall play!

57
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:54,035
Hey! What the hell are you doing!

58
00:02:54,138 --> 00:02:55,014
Oh! Hey, Cartman!

59
00:02:55,355 --> 00:02:56,676
We're playing dreidel!
You wanna try?!

60
00:02:56,975 --> 00:02:57,815
Sure!

61
00:02:59,481 --> 00:03:02,174
Here's a little dreidel that's
small and made of clay,

62
00:03:02,669 --> 00:03:05,405
but I'm not gonna play with it,
'cause dreidel's frickin' gay!

63
00:03:05,696 --> 00:03:06,947
Hey! Shut your mouth, fatass!

64
00:03:07,276 --> 00:03:12,585
Jews play stupid games! Jews!
That's why they're lame!

65
00:03:12,759 --> 00:03:19,300
Jews play stupid games! Jews!
That's why they're lame!

66
00:03:19,368 --> 00:03:21,615
What's going on?! Oh!
It's that Hanukkah thing!

67
00:03:22,161 --> 00:03:23,624
It's so amazing!

68
00:03:23,358 --> 00:03:27,058
You spin this thing on the ground
and it goes round and round,

69
00:03:27,144 --> 00:03:28,003
and I could watch it all day!

70
00:03:28,017 --> 00:03:30,070
Let me try!

71
00:03:30,121 --> 00:03:35,756
I'll try to make it spin!
It fell! I'll try again!

72
00:03:36,225 --> 00:03:42,161
I'll try to make it spin! It fell!
I'll try again!

73
00:03:55,768 --> 00:03:56,800
Hello, boys!

74
00:03:57,190 --> 00:03:57,811
Hi, mom!

75
00:03:57,979 --> 00:04:00,643
Oh, how precious!
You boys are all playing dreidel!

76
00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:04,077
Now, you know that dreidel is a time
on a tradition for the Hebrew people!

77
00:04:04,082 --> 00:04:07,586
Yes! We know, Miss Broflovski!
It's so very interesting!

78
00:04:07,909 --> 00:04:13,028
Now when you learn to make the
dreidel spin, you'll know our people

79
00:04:13,029 --> 00:04:17,339
always win! Keep spinning!
Learn to make the dreidel spin!

80
00:04:17,751 --> 00:04:20,572
You'll know our people always win!

81
00:04:21,789 --> 00:04:22,661
Oh! Hi, dad!

82
00:04:23,077 --> 00:04:24,964
Hello, everybody! Say!
Can I join in?

83
00:04:25,044 --> 00:04:30,088
Sure! I have a little dreidel!
I made it out of clay!

84
00:04:30,525 --> 00:04:33,879
And when it's dry and ready,
with dreidel, I shall EVERYBODY!

85
00:04:33,910 --> 00:04:36,546
Dreidel, dreidel dreidel!
I made you out of clay!

86
00:04:36,975 --> 00:04:39,736
Dreidel, dreidel dreidel!
With dreidel, I shall play!

87
00:04:40,162 --> 00:04:42,966
Oh, dreidel, dreidel dreidel!
I made you out of clay!

88
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:46,157
Dreidel, dreidel dreidel!
With dreidel, I shall play!

89
00:04:46,632 --> 00:04:52,451
Courtney Cox, I love you!
You're so hot on that show!

90
00:04:52,842 --> 00:04:53,703
Dad?!

91
00:04:53,559 --> 00:04:54,559
Courtney Cox,...

92
00:04:54,390 --> 00:04:55,613
Dad?!

93
00:04:55,614 --> 00:04:56,564
We're singing about a dreidel!

94
00:04:58,155 --> 00:04:58,619
Oh, sorry!

95
00:04:59,287 --> 00:05:00,801
We'll talk about this later, Gerald!

96
00:05:23,422 --> 00:05:27,343
Woo hoo! Golly! That sure was fun!
But now for our next song!

97
00:05:28,096 --> 00:05:32,302
Hold on to your boot straps,
'cause we're gonna descend down into Hell!

98
00:05:43,033 --> 00:05:51,713
Oh, tannenbaum! Oh, tannenbaum!
Die teil chi hein blatter!

99
00:05:52,582 --> 00:06:00,901
Oh, tannenbaum! Oh, tannenbaum!

100

Too groo chnid doo noot zamadine!

Oh, tannenbaum! Oh, tannenbaum!

102
00:06:23,187 --> 00:06:25,917
Hey! Hitler! What's the matter,
little guy?!

103
00:06:26,899 --> 00:06:31,840
Oh, Satan! Tu tannenbaum die
teil chi hein blatter!

104
00:06:33,394 --> 00:06:35,630
Aaaw! You don't have
Christmas Tree?!

105
00:06:35,934 --> 00:06:39,061
Nootint dien dien
reetint minintstein!

106
00:06:39,692 --> 00:06:42,697
Well, I tell you what! Maybe we'll
have ourselves a little

107
00:06:43,482 --> 00:06:44,900
Christmas right here!

108
00:06:44,976 --> 00:06:46,206
C'mon, everyone! Gather 'round!

109
00:06:46,310 --> 00:06:48,900
String up the lights
and light up the tree!

110
00:06:48,972 --> 00:06:51,050
We're gonna make some revelry!

111
00:06:51,068 --> 00:06:54,718
Spirits are high, so I can tell it's
Christmas time in Hell!

112
00:06:55,286 --> 00:06:59,234
Demons are nicer as you pass them by!
There's lot's of demon toys to buy!

113
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:03,146
The snow is falling and all is well!
It's Christmas time in hell!

114
00:07:03,754 --> 00:07:07,344
There goes Jeffrey Dahmer
wiht a festive Christmas ham!

115
00:07:07,903 --> 00:07:11,499
After he has sex with it, he'll
eat up all he can!

116
00:07:12,141 --> 00:07:15,774
And there goes John F. Kennedy
caroling with his son!

117
00:07:16,257 --> 00:07:20,391
Reunited for the holidays!
God bless us everyone!

118
00:07:20,531 --> 00:07:22,454
Everybody has a happy glow!

119
00:07:22,570 --> 00:07:24,480
Let's dance in blood
and pretend it's snow!

120
00:07:24,715 --> 00:07:26,702
Even Maw Tse Tung
is under the spell!

121
00:07:26,736 --> 00:07:28,517
It's Christmas time in hell!

122
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:32,065
Aldolf, here's a present for you!

123
00:07:32,187 --> 00:07:34,649
Oh! UND TANNENBAUM!

124
00:07:34,973 --> 00:07:36,349
Yes! Und tannenbaum!

125
00:07:37,418 --> 00:07:41,430
God cast me down from heaven's
door to rule in hell forevermore!

126
00:07:41,571 --> 00:07:45,225
But now I'm kinda glad that I fell,
'cause it's Christmas time in hell!

127
00:07:45,843 --> 00:07:47,688
Here's a rack to hang
the stockings on!

128
00:07:47,899 --> 00:07:49,745
We still have to shop
for Genghis Khan!

129
00:07:50,062 --> 00:07:51,887
Michael Landon's hair looks swell!

130
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:53,661
It's Christmas time in hell!

131
00:07:54,341 --> 00:07:58,939
There's Princess Diana holding
burning mistletoe over poor

132
00:07:59,377 --> 00:08:02,048
Gene Siskel's head to watch
his weenie grow!

133
00:08:02,605 --> 00:08:06,165
For wone day we all stop burning,
and the flames are not so thick!

134
00:08:06,681 --> 00:08:10,760
All the screaming and the torture
stops as we wait for ol' Saint Nick!

135
00:08:11,035 --> 00:08:13,102
So, string up the lights
and light up the tree!

136
00:08:13,155 --> 00:08:17,050
We're damned for all eternity,
but for just one day, all is well!

137
00:08:17,272 --> 00:08:19,152
It's Christmas time in hell!

138
00:08:19,517 --> 00:08:21,290
Gather close together
and make it quick!

139
00:08:21,497 --> 00:08:23,553
We gotta make room for Andy Dick!

140
00:08:23,682 --> 00:08:27,500
Wake his mother and ring the bell!

141
00:08:27,553 --> 00:08:44,822
It's Christmas time! Christmas time!
It's Christmas time in hell!

142
00:08:43,377 --> 00:08:45,437
Merry Christmas, movie house!

143
00:08:47,979 --> 00:08:49,511
Fighting the frizzies at eleven!

144
00:08:50,487 --> 00:08:52,335
Howdy ho!

145
00:08:56,250 --> 00:08:57,573
Uh, Hark! Hear the bells!

146
00:08:57,906 --> 00:09:01,971
Sweet silver bells all seem to say,
ding dong, m'kay! Christmas is here!

147
00:09:02,301 --> 00:09:04,595
Bringing good cheer to young and old!

148
00:09:04,683 --> 00:09:06,896
Drinkin' a bowl!
Ding, dong, ding, dong!

149
00:09:07,023 --> 00:09:10,450
That is their song! This joyful ring!
All caroling!

150
00:09:10,514 --> 00:09:13,944
One seems to hear words
of good cheer, from everywhere,

151
00:09:14,061 --> 00:09:15,284
filling the air!

152
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:17,591
Oh, how they pound,
raising their sound!

153
00:09:17,663 --> 00:09:19,936
Oh, here and there,
telling their tale!

154
00:09:20,065 --> 00:09:23,372
Gaily, they ring while people
sing songs of good cheer!

155
00:09:23,611 --> 00:09:26,719
Christmas is here! Merry,
Merry, Merry, Merry Christmas!

156
00:09:27,162 --> 00:09:29,184
Merry, Merry, Merry,
Merry Christmas!

157
00:09:29,498 --> 00:09:34,142
Joyful they sing! All without end!
Their lovely hum to everyone!

158
00:09:34,233 --> 00:09:35,359
Hark! Hear the bells!

159
00:09:35,411 --> 00:09:38,949
Sweet silver bells all seem to say,
ding dong, m'kay!

160
00:09:38,961 --> 00:09:44,917
On do they sing, on without end!
Their joyful toungue to every home!

161
00:09:45,573 --> 00:09:50,479
Ding, dong, ding, dong!
M'kay! ... M'kay!

162
00:09:51,696 --> 00:09:55,837
Well, that was a nice little song!
Wasn't it?!

163
00:09:56,248 --> 00:09:59,349
But, let's not forget that for some
people, Christmas is about the

164
00:09:59,433 --> 00:10:02,573
birth of Jesus! So now, here's a
more serious

165
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:05,918
Christmas song sung by Eric Cartman!

166
00:10:13,697 --> 00:10:23,714
And ... O holy night! The stars are
brightly shining!

167
00:10:23,767 --> 00:10:31,366
It is the night of our dear
saviour's b-b-b-birth!

168
00:10:33,317 --> 00:10:35,887
O holy night!

169
00:10:36,782 --> 00:10:41,854
The, something, something, descend!

170
00:10:42,504 --> 00:10:49,174
It is the night with the Christmas
trees and pie!

171
00:10:51,402 --> 00:11:06,600
Jesus was born and so I get presents!
Thank you, Jesus, for being born!

172
00:11:06,626 --> 00:11:21,258
Fall on your knees and hear
the angels, something!

173
00:11:21,964 --> 00:11:35,157
O night divine!
O night when I get presents!

174
00:11:36,169 --> 00:11:59,071
O night divine!
O night, o night divine!

175
00:12:01,592 --> 00:12:05,643
Oh, boy! That was a super song!
And now, let's hear from

176
00:12:06,103 --> 00:12:08,689
the school teacher, Mr. Garrison!

177
00:12:10,261 --> 00:12:13,045
Okay, children! Let's take our seats!
Today, we're gonna learn how

178
00:12:13,089 --> 00:12:16,474
different cultures around the world
celebrate the holiday season!

179
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:17,869
Aaaaaaaw!

180
00:12:17,970 --> 00:12:19,451
Now, pay attention! Ahem!

181
00:12:20,026 --> 00:12:23,810
I heard there is no Christmas in the
silly Middle East!

182
00:12:24,221 --> 00:12:26,276
No trees! No snow!
No Santa Clause!

183
00:12:26,483 --> 00:12:28,700
They have different religious beliefs!

184
00:12:28,792 --> 00:12:33,318
They believe in Muhahmad
and not in our holiday!

185
00:12:33,366 --> 00:12:37,194
And so, every December,
I go to the Middle East and say!

186
00:12:39,288 --> 00:12:42,037
Hey there, Mr. Muslim,
Merry Fuckin' Christmas!

187
00:12:42,412 --> 00:12:45,542
Put down that book, the Koran,
and hear some holiday wishes!

188
00:12:47,208 --> 00:12:50,016
In case you haven't noticed,
it's Jesus's birthday!

189
00:12:50,355 --> 00:12:53,523
So get off your heathen Muslim
ass and fuckin' celebrate!

190
00:12:55,918 --> 00:12:59,500
There is no holiday season in India,
I've heard!

191
00:12:59,545 --> 00:13:03,231
They don't hang up their stockings,
and that is just absurd!

192
00:13:03,298 --> 00:13:06,822
They've never read a Christmas story!
They don't know what Rudolph is about!

193
00:13:07,246 --> 00:13:12,029
And that is why, in December,
I'll go to India and shout!

194
00:13:13,374 --> 00:13:16,287
Hey there, Mr. Hinduist,
Merry Fuckin' Christmas!

195
00:13:16,402 --> 00:13:19,677
Drink egg nog and eat some beef
and pass it to the Mrs.!

196
00:13:21,163 --> 00:13:23,834
In case you haven't noticed,
it's Jesus's birthday!

197
00:13:24,193 --> 00:13:27,265
So get off your heathen Hindu ass
and fuckin' celebrate!

198
00:13:29,548 --> 00:13:32,900
Now, I heard that in Japan,
Everyone just lives in sin!

199
00:13:32,937 --> 00:13:35,768
They pray to several gods and put
needles in their skin!

200
00:13:36,811 --> 00:13:39,259
On December 25th, all they do
is eat a cake!

201
00:13:39,714 --> 00:13:44,585
And that is why I go to Japan and
walk around and say!

202
00:13:45,958 --> 00:13:49,021
Hey there, Mr. Shintoist,
Merry Fuckin' Christmas!

203
00:13:49,185 --> 00:13:52,088
God is gonna kick your ass, you
infidelic pagan scum!

204
00:13:53,738 --> 00:13:56,199
In case you haven't noticed, there's
festive things to do!

205
00:13:56,604 --> 00:13:59,745
So let's all rejoice for Jesus!
Merry Fuckin' Christmas to you!

206
00:14:01,843 --> 00:14:04,937
On Christmas day, I travel
'round the world!

207
00:14:05,636 --> 00:14:09,328
Taoists, Krushnas, Buddhists,
and all you atheists too,

208
00:14:09,971 --> 00:14:20,585
Merry Fuckin' Christmas to you!
Uh, thank you, Mr. Hat!

209
00:14:21,288 --> 00:14:22,364
Frizzies at eleven!

210
00:14:23,509 --> 00:14:25,017
Howdy ho!

211
00:14:31,079 --> 00:14:35,242
I saw three ships come sailing in,
on Christmas day, on Christmas day!

212
00:14:35,357 --> 00:14:39,636
I saw three ships come sailing in,
on Christmas day in the morning!

213
00:14:39,795 --> 00:14:44,030
And what was in those ships all three,
on Christmas day, on Christmas day!

214
00:14:44,150 --> 00:14:44,800
And what

215
00:14:44,843 --> 00:14:47,374
Shut up, turds!

216
00:14:49,757 --> 00:14:53,256
was in those ships all three,
on Christmas day in the morning!

217
00:14:53,264 --> 00:14:57,407
The virgin Mary and Christ were there,
on Christmas day, on Christmas day!

218
00:14:57,724 --> 00:14:58,867
The virgin Mary and

219
00:14:58,969 --> 00:15:00,690
Shut up, turds!

220
00:15:03,006 --> 00:15:05,565
Christ were there,
on Christmas day in the morning!

221
00:15:06,031 --> 00:15:10,244
Let us all rejoice! Amen!
On Christmas day, on Christmas day!

222
00:15:10,587 --> 00:15:10,888
Let

223
00:15:11,118 --> 00:15:12,867
I told you to shut up!

224
00:15:15,308 --> 00:15:18,713
us all rejoice! Amen!
On Christmas day in the morning!

225
00:15:18,859 --> 00:15:23,188
Shelly is starting to get pissed,
on Christmas day, on Christmas day!

226
00:15:23,212 --> 00:15:27,864
Shelly got up and killed the turds,
on Christmas day in the MORNING!

227
00:15:33,620 --> 00:15:37,800
Golly, that sure was swell! I'd say
my Christmas special is going

228
00:15:37,898 --> 00:15:39,333
super fantastic!

229
00:15:39,493 --> 00:15:43,295
But now, it's time to hear from
perhaps the two most important

230
00:15:43,831 --> 00:15:45,761
people of the whole season!

231
00:15:48,187 --> 00:15:49,593
Hello, everyone, and welcome
to McKemicks!

232
00:15:50,207 --> 00:15:54,749
Now, please put your hands together and
welcome Saint Nicholaus and Jesus Christ!

233
00:15:56,014 --> 00:15:58,014
Hello, everybody!

234
00:15:58,148 --> 00:16:00,148
How y'all doin' tonight!

235
00:16:00,248 --> 00:16:03,766
You know, Jesus, there've been so
many wonderfull songs written

236
00:16:03,921 --> 00:16:05,049
about us over the years!

237
00:16:05,575 --> 00:16:09,040
That's right, Santa, and we love each
and everyone of them! Like this one!

238
00:16:09,647 --> 00:16:19,434
Joy to the world, for I have come!
Let Earth receive...me!

239
00:16:20,718 --> 00:16:24,754
Let every heart prepare me room...

240
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:26,698
...and heaven and nature sing!

241
00:16:27,286 --> 00:16:28,675
...and heaven and nature sing!

242
00:16:29,216 --> 00:16:33,565
...and heaven and heaven
and nature sing!

243
00:16:33,599 --> 00:16:36,781
You know, Jesus, that is a nice song!
But I like this one!

244
00:16:37,362 --> 00:16:41,284
Up on the house top, raindeer paws
out jumps good ol' me!

245
00:16:41,882 --> 00:16:44,055
Down through the chimney
with lots of toys!

246
00:16:44,308 --> 00:16:46,416
All for the little one's
Christmas joys!

247
00:16:46,611 --> 00:16:51,129
Ho, ho, ho! Who wouldn't go!
Ho, ho, ho! Who wouldn't go!

248
00:16:51,244 --> 00:16:53,346
Oh, up on the house top!
Click, click, click!

249
00:16:53,583 --> 00:16:55,851
Down through the chimney
with good ol' me!

250
00:16:56,292 --> 00:16:57,066
You get away!

251
00:16:57,306 --> 00:16:57,957
Go away?!

252
00:16:58,223 --> 00:16:58,815
GET away!

253
00:16:59,076 --> 00:16:59,834
WHERE away?!

254
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:05,219
Away in the manger,
no crib for my bed!

255
00:17:05,861 --> 00:17:10,458
That's where cute little ol' me-e lay
down my sweet head!

256
00:17:10,967 --> 00:17:15,936
The stars in the sky look down
where I lay!

257
00:17:16,006 --> 00:17:21,000
Cute little eight pound me-e asleep
in the hay!

258
00:17:23,904 --> 00:17:28,290
Oh come all ye faithful, joyful,
and triumphant!

259
00:17:28,504 --> 00:17:32,526
Oh come ye to bethlehem to see-ee me!

260
00:17:32,691 --> 00:17:33,300
Here's one!

261
00:17:33,303 --> 00:17:35,253
Hark the harold angels sing!

262
00:17:35,482 --> 00:17:36,900
It's my turn!

263
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:39,281
Glory to-o me-e-e! Silient night!

264
00:17:39,428 --> 00:17:39,900
Uh...!

265
00:17:40,571 --> 00:17:41,400
Santa, uh!

266
00:17:41,497 --> 00:17:44,600
All is calm! All is bright!
'Round yon virgin mother and me!

267
00:17:44,685 --> 00:17:45,200
Saint Nicholaus!

268
00:17:45,298 --> 00:17:49,200
Holy me-e-e, tender and mild!
Sleep in heavenly peace!

269
00:17:49,234 --> 00:17:51,388
Sleep in heavenly peace!

270
00:17:51,782 --> 00:17:55,082
Okay, Jesus! Here's one
you might remember!

271
00:17:55,180 --> 00:18:01,598
Her name is Rio and she dances
on the sand, just like that river

272
00:18:01,984 --> 00:18:04,184
twistin' through the dusty land!

273
00:18:04,325 --> 00:18:06,400
Uh, Santa! Santa! Santa!
That's not a Christmas song! But I...

274
00:18:06,468 --> 00:18:09,266
I know, but there's like three
hundred Jesus Christmas songs

275
00:18:09,293 --> 00:18:12,613
and only four fucking Santa ones!
It's not fair! Just do it yourself!

276
00:18:12,903 --> 00:18:13,500
I'm leaving!

277
00:18:13,590 --> 00:18:15,122
Oh c'mon, Santa! You can't leave!

278
00:18:15,128 --> 00:18:16,555
No! Fuck you, Jesus!

279
00:18:17,069 --> 00:18:21,671
But, Santa! ... The weather outside is frightful...

280
00:18:22,023 --> 00:18:22,600
No!

281
00:18:22,673 --> 00:18:26,585
...But the fire is so delightful!

282
00:18:26,630 --> 00:18:29,862
...Well, since I've no place to go...!

283
00:18:30,542 --> 00:18:33,044
Let it snow! Let it snow! Let it snow!

284
00:18:34,249 --> 00:18:35,867
It doesn't show signs of stopping!

285
00:18:36,374 --> 00:18:38,849
But I brought some corn
for poopity-popping!

286
00:18:39,068 --> 00:18:41,026
The lights are turned way down low!

287
00:18:41,027 --> 00:18:41,444
So...

288
00:18:41,497 --> 00:18:46,267
Let it snow! Let it snow!
Let it snow! The fire is slowly dying!

289
00:18:46,572 --> 00:18:49,500
And, my dear, we're still
good-bah-bee-bying!

290
00:18:49,838 --> 00:18:52,080
But, as long as you love me so,...

291
00:18:52,183 --> 00:18:59,998
Let it snow! Let it snow!
Let it snow!

292
00:19:00,008 --> 00:19:04,756
Her name is Rio and she
dances on the sand!

293
00:19:10,428 --> 00:19:12,088
Fighting frizzies at eleven!

294
00:19:12,931 --> 00:19:14,670
Howdy ho!

295
00:19:17,458 --> 00:19:20,808
Well, I guess that's about the end
of our Christmas album!

296
00:19:21,837 --> 00:19:24,988
Gosh, it was sure nice hangin' out
with y'all, yeah!

297
00:19:27,309 --> 00:19:31,304
And, I guess if there's just one
thing I have left to say,

298
00:19:32,330 --> 00:19:33,508
it would be this!

299
00:19:34,430 --> 00:19:39,632
Have yourself a
Merry Little Christmas!

300
00:19:41,143 --> 00:19:44,812
Make the ultide ham!

301
00:19:46,038 --> 00:19:53,113
From now on, our
troubles will be miles away!

302
00:19:57,797 --> 00:20:08,369
Here we are as in olden days!
Happy golden days of yours!

303
00:20:09,799 --> 00:20:20,973
Faithful friends who are dear to us
gather near to us once more!

304
00:20:23,609 --> 00:20:34,138
Through the years, we all will be
