00:00:36,565 --> 00:00:39,365
No, Kitty! These are my spicy hot Louisiana baked chicken tenders!

3
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:41,080
No, Kitty!

4
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:42,280
Someday I will collect all the Chinpokomon!

5
00:00:42,313 --> 00:00:46,573
Then, I will fight the evil power that will reveal itself once all the Chinpokomon are collected! Oha!

6
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:51,080
No, Kitty! You can't have these chicken tenders, because they are mine and I keep mine to myself! Oha!

7
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:55,280
Be sure to tune in tomorrow for another inexplicable episode of Chinpokomon!

8
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:58,080
Hey, kids! Do you love Chinpokomon?!

9
00:00:58,120 --> 00:00:59,080
Yes!

10
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:01,080
Well, now you can buy your very own!

11
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:04,280
I've got to buy Chinpokomon! I've got to buy it! I've got to buy it!

12
00:01:05,020 --> 00:01:05,980

13
00:01:06,073 --> 00:01:06,473

LambToy

18
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:12,080
Collect them all and you can become Royal Crown Chinpokomaster!

19
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:15,120
Royal Crown Chinpokomaster?! Holy Shit!

20
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:17,120
All the Chinpokomon are in stores now!

21
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:20,120
Chinpokomon is super universe toy number one!

22
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:23,120
I've got to buy it! Chinpokomon!

23
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:24,120
Mom! Mom!

24
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:28,080
Mom! Seriously! This thing at the toy store, Mom! Hnya! Must go! Toy store!

25
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:29,080

26
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:31,080
I'm seriously! Mom! Must go! Must buy!

27
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:32,080
What is it, Eric?

28
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:34,080
Mom, I've only just heard!

29
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:35,980
Mom, I've only just heard! They're making Chinpokomon dolls Mom!

30
00:01:36,091 --> 00:01:38,491
You can collect them all! You can collect them all! Mother, quick! We must get to the toy store!

31
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:41,080
I'm making us some lunch right now, Eric!

32
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:48,000
But, Mom, I have to get a Chinpokomom doll before everybody else does, 'cause then I'll be cool!

33
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:51,120
Can't it wait 'til tomorrow, hon?!

34
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:55,160
But, Mom, I have to get the first one or else people won't think I'm cool!

35
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:58,160
- Alright! Let's go!
- Sweet!

36
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:02,360
Everybody's gonna be so jealous when they see my Chinpokomon!

37
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:06,120
Oh! Goddammit!

38
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:08,120
- Hey, fatass!
- Hey, dickhole! I guess you saw the commercial too!

39
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:11,120
Yep! I've got Roostor, LambTron, and Shoe!

40
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:14,400
Well, that's nice! But, I'm gonna get a Pengon! He's the coolest!

41
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:17,120
Goddamit! There's no more Pengons!

42
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:20,120
Kenny! Pengon is my favourite! That's the last one! Let me have it!

43
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Mnya, Kenny! Let me have it!

44
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,760
Mnya! Gimmie Pengon!

45
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:30,160
Honestly! I don't see what they find so amusing about those things!

46
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:32,160
They're so strange! Where are they from?!

47
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:34,700
Well, it's some new big thing from Japan!

48
00:02:34,927 --> 00:02:37,127
I tell ya! Those Japaneese really know how to market to kids!

49
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,160
I've got to collect all Chinpokomon!

50
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,800
I've got to collect them all so I can become Royal Crown Chinpokomaster! Oha!

51
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:45,860
Order Chinpokomon and you
will have happy feelings!

52
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:49,160
I have to become Royal Crown Chinpokomaster!

53
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,560
Must collect Chinpokomom!

54
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:55,860
Okay, Kenny! I'll trade you my ChuChuNesbi for your Pengon!

55
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:58,460
Goddammit! You're supposed to trade, little asshole! Gimmie Pengon!

56
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:02,160
Hey, dudes! What're those?!!
-What're these?!? They're Chinpokomon!

57
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:04,200
You don't appear to have any Chinpokomon!

58
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:07,200
Nope, but look! I just got this sweet Cyborg Bill doll!

59
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:11,200
Oh! Please! Cyborg Bill is so yesterday!
-Yeah, like ancient history!

60
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,200
Cyborg Bill isn't cool anymore?!
-No, dude!

61
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:16,200
Cyborg Bill hasn't been cool for a long time, Kyle!

62
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:19,200
Why the hell don't people tell me these things?!
-It's all Chinpokomon, now!

63
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:22,200
Dude, if you collect Chinpokomon, you can complete the Primary Main Objective!

64
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,200
What's the Primary Main Objective?!

65
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:25,200
You don't even know what the Primary Main Objective is?!

66
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:28,200
The Primary Main Objective is to destroy the Evil Power! -Well, what's the Evil Power?!

67
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:29,200
Oh, my God!

68
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:32,200
The identity of the Evil Power won't be revealed until all

69
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:34,200
Chinpokomon are collected by a Royal Crown Chinpokomaster!

70
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:35,200
What?!

71
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:37,200
Kyle, get with the time, dude!

72
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:38,600
Shit!

73
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,080
Yeah, I guess so!

74
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:42,200
Mom! Dad! Can I have money to buy Chinpokomon?!

75
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:45,200
What's a Chinpokomon?!
- I'm not sure!

76
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:46,540
Well, why do you need one?!

77
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:48,140
I don't know!

78
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:52,240
Well then, the answer is no, Kyle! You just got money to buy your Cyborg Bill doll!

79
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:54,240
Yeah, but Cyborg Bill is totally gay now!

80
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:56,240
Please, Mom! Everybody else has Chinpokomon!

81
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:58,520
Well, Kyle, that's not a reason to buy something!

82
00:03:58,640 --> 00:03:59,040
Nah, Kyle! Don't!

83
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,240
You see, son! Fads come and go!

84
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:04,040
And, this Chinpokomon is obviously nothing more than a fad!

85
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:05,940
You don't have to be a part of it!

86
00:04:06,144 --> 00:04:09,044
In fact, you can even make an even stronger statement by saying to your peers

87
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:13,200
"I'm not going to be a part of this fad
because I'm an individual!"

88
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:15,200
Do you understand?!
- Yes! Yes I do, Dad!

89
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:17,200
Now, let me tell you how it works in the real world!

90
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:19,200
In the real world, I can either get a Chinpokomon

91
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:21,240
or I can be the only kid without one

92
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:24,240
which singles me out and causes the other kids to make fun of me and kick my ass!

93
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,240
Hm! Good point! Here's ten dollars!
-Thanks!

94
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:28,400
Wait! Here's twenty! Get one for your brother too!

95
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:34,280
There you go, son! I honestly don't know what you see in these things!

96
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:36,000
Neither do I!

97
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,560
Guess I'll call it a night!

98
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:43,280
Chinpoko! Buy me! Buy me!

99
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:47,240
When will you become Royal Chinpokomaster?

100
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:49,240
Hurry up and buy me!

101
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:51,240
Down with America!

102
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:52,240
What?!

103
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:54,240
I love you! Let's be best friends

104
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:56,240
and destroy the capitalist American government!

105
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:58,800
What the hell is going on here!

106
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:05,280
Hey, you guys! Check out my sweet Chinpokomon doll!

107
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:08,320
Oh, please! Chinpokomon dolls are so last week!

108
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:11,320
What!? -Yeah, dude! Don't you know?!
It's all about the Chinpokomon video game now!

109
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:14,320
Did you bring your special Chinpokomon game controler?!

110
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:15,320
Huh?! No!

111
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:20,400
Oh! You didn't GET a special Chinpokomon game controler! Jesus Christ!

112
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:23,280
Chinpokomon! What is Primary Objective?!

113
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:25,280
To destroy the Evil Power!

114
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:28,280
I've got to buy all the Chinpokomon so I can destroy the Evil Power! Oha!

115
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:29,280
Damnit!

116
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:33,280
I've got to buy them all! So first, I'd better go to Hawaii and visit Pearl Harbor!

117
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:37,480
Try to bomb the harbour! Ready?! GO!

118
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:45,320
I must collect them all! I must buy them all!

119
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:46,320
We must buy them all!

120
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,400
Try to bomb the harbour!

121
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:57,320
Dude! The video game game Kenny a seisure!

122
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,200
Dude! This game rules!

123
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:15,320
Welcome to Chinpokomon Toy Corporation! Please state name!

124
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:19,360
Red Harris! I own a toy store in America!

125
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:21,360
Please state purpose!

126
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:25,360
Uh, I wanna know what the hell you people are doing with these dolls

127
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:28,000
talking about bringing down American government and all!

128
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:37,360
I am president Hirohito and this is Mr. Hosek!

129
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:38,360
Pleased to meet you!

130
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:42,360
We understand you have big concern about our fine product!

131
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:43,360
Well, yes...

132
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:45,360
Do you mind telling me what the hell this is about

133
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:50,060
The American government lies to you! Join the fight for Japaneese supremecy of the world! More to come!

134
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:53,360
Well?!

135
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:55,360
That is so strange!

136
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:57,360
I do not know how this could happen!

137
00:06:57,400 --> 00:07:01,360
But, rest assured that I will make sure it does not happen again!

138
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:04,360
Well, now c'mon! I don't think that that quite satisfies my...

139
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:05,360
You are American?!

140
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:06,360
Yes...

141
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:09,360
Oh! You must have very big penis!

142
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:13,360
Excuse me?! I was just asking you what you're up to with these toys!

143
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:17,400
Nothing! We are very simple people with very small penis!

144
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:21,120
Mr. Hosek's penis is especially small!

145
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:22,400
He he he! So small!

146
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:25,400
We cannot achieve much with so small penis!

147
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:29,600
But, you Americans! Wow! Penis so big! SO BIG PENIS!

148
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:32,400
Well, I-I guess it is a pretty good size.

149
00:07:33,230 --> 00:07:34,230
Minata, kite kite!

150
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:38,313
This man has a very big penis!

151
00:07:38,313 --> 00:07:40,901
Take takeru o da ne? 
-Hai

152
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:44,240
What an enorm-immense penis!

153
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:47,400
Well, it certainly was nice meeting you folk! I just wanted to bring that...

154
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:49,400
little malfunction to your attention! Bye, bye now...

155
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:53,600
Goodbye! Thank you for stopping by with your gargantuoum penis!

156
00:07:58,295 --> 00:08:00,095
Dame, dame da!

157
00:08:01,158 --> 00:08:02,958
Naze kono chippu wa soto ni detandaba?

158
00:08:03,371 --> 00:08:05,471
Wa, wakarimasen, sachoo san. Mondai desu nee.

159
00:08:06,155 --> 00:08:07,455
Sekinin shoo yobe!

160
00:08:07,716 --> 00:08:08,716
Hai. Hai, sachoo san.

161
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:17,440
I've got to buy Chinpokomon! I've got to buy them!

162
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:21,640
Must buy Chinpokomon!

163
00:08:31,042 --> 00:08:37,041
Amerikano, kodomo mindaga Chinpokomon motte imaga, "phase two" kaesrokida... IKIMASHOO!

164
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:41,680
The time has come! We will take Pearl Harbor!

165
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:46,400
What're you doing?!

166
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,600
I'm watching one of Stanley's Chinpokomon video tapes!

167
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:49,420
Why?!

168
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:52,160
Our son loves this show, Randy! So I think it's important that we watch it

169
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:54,720
to see if it's teaching him good moral values!

170
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:56,760
Hey! You must be Roostor! I haven't bought one of you yet,

171
00:08:56,760 --> 00:09:00,760
but I bet you can transform into Roostalion if you found Diamond Skill Seven!

172
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:03,240
Roostor!

173
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:05,760
Hey! I'm gonna take your Roostor and put it in this bag

174
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:07,760
where willll flurish or expire depending on fate!

175
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:08,760
Hey! Is that a good idea?!

176
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:12,960
Roostors aren't like ChuChuNesbis! They haven't the heart for such endeavors!

177
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:19,140
Are those good moral values?! -I don't know what the hell they're talking about!

178
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:24,080
LambTron! You are loosing the battle of your life!

179
00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:27,080
But LambTron power level gives him a good chance of new fight! Will they succeed?!

180
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:30,480
I am sad now because LambTron must be very lonely

181
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:33,320
because there are so many LambTrons in the world! Will he ever find a companion?!

182
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:37,220
This doesn't make sense! Are those stupid things supposed to be animals or robots or what?!

183
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:39,520
I don't know, but I suddenly kinda wanna own them all!

184
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:41,520
Randy, we can't allow our son to watch this stuff!

185
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:43,520
Well, it's not like it's vulgar or violent!

186
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:47,480
No, but it's incredibly stupid and that can be worse on a child's mind than any vulgarity or violence!

187
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:51,480
Remember what Battle of the Network Stars did to an entire generation!

188
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:52,800
My God! You're right!

189
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:54,840
C'mon, brothers and sisters!

190
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:57,840
We've all got to join together! Join together and give me money

191
00:09:57,880 --> 00:09:59,840
so I can buy more Chinpokomon!

192
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:01,520
We've got to stop this fightin'!

193
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:03,520
- How's it goin, fatass?!
- Haven't made any money yet!

194
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:06,400
What?! You've been out here all weekend! How're we gonna raise money to get into the Chinpokomon Camp?!

195
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:11,120
Hey! I'm the one who's been standing out here with this gay guitar like a goddam hippie all weekend! What've you two assholes done?!

196
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:13,960
We can't do anything! Kenny still hasn't come out of his seisure!

197
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:18,760
I've got it! I've got my Chinpokomon game controler!

198
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:23,520
Jesus-Tap-Dancing-Christ! Get with the program, Kyle!

199
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:27,720
Yeah, nobody plays the Chinpokomon video games anymore! Now, it's all about the big Weekend Chinpokomon Camp!

200
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:28,600
Camp?!

201
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:32,040
The makers of Chinpokomon are going town-to-town and putting on a special camp

202
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:35,040
to show all the Chinpokomasters how to destroy the Evil Power!

203
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:38,040
- You didn't know that?!
- N'naaw, I knew it! I knew it! I was just testing you guys!

204
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:42,800
You just wait 'til I get to that Chinpokomon Camp! I'm gonna be the toughest master of them all! So we'll see you there! Ai!

205
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:44,520
Dude! Did you just say "Ai!"?

206
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:46,400
Yeah! You know! Like Lauren Hill! Ai!

207
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:50,400
Oh my God! That's so yesterday!
- Yeah, dude! Nobody says "Ai!" anymore!

208
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:54,200
What?! "Ai!"'s not cool either?! When did that happen?!
- Like, eight days ago!

209
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:55,600
Goddammit!

210
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,960
Hey, kids! Only one more day 'til the Chinpokomon Camp!

211
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,960
Come early and enjoy all the Chinpokofun!

212
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,960
''I have to buy a ticket!.''

213
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,960
''I have to buy one! A ticket! I've got to buy, buy, buy!.''

214
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,960
This Saturday and Sunday, you can't wait to go!

215
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,680
Chinpokomon!

216
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:19,080
We just thought we'd bring it to everyone's attention because honestly, we don't know how to feel!

217
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:23,280
Well, I'm letting Eric go to the camp! I mean, it seems to me this Chinpokomon thing is just another harmless fad!

218
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:26,120
Yeah! We told Kyle he could go if he did all his chores and he did!

219
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:30,120
No, I'm not sure this blaitant commercialim is good for our boys!

220
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:32,820
Well, you know how it is, Randy! The more we forbid them to play with Chinpokomons,

221
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:34,120
the more they're gonna love them!

222
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:38,120
You're right, Sheila! I guess the best thing we can do is just let them go until they get sick of it!

223
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:42,320
Sure! Aparently, they've been doing these camps in every city around the country! How bad can they be?!

224
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:46,640
- Get out of the way! Move it!
- Can you see anything?

225
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:49,000
It's starting! It's starting!

226
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:52,320
''I've got to buy it! I've got to buy it!!''

227
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:54,400
Chinpokomon!

228
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:57,600
Attention! Attention!

229
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:59,600
This is Chinpokomon Camp!

230
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:01,800
Chinpokomon is what we store between our hearts!

231
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:03,000
Our hearts!

232
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,800
Kenny?!

233
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,200
What is the Primary Main Objective?!

234
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:08,200
To destroy the Evil Power!

235
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,000
Power!

236
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:12,400
Yes! And, what is the Evil Power?!

237
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:17,200
The Evil Power is...the United States Government!

238
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:24,360
United States Government is an Evil Power! It has taken Japaneese military!

239
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:29,360
It has broken Japaneese spirit! And, what do Chinpokomasters do to the evil power?!

240
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:31,160
Destroy it!

241
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,160
Destroy it?!

242
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:33,120
That is correct!

243
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:37,120
Now, it is a great honour to present...your Chinpokoleader!

244
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:40,240
Emperor Hirohito!

245
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:44,240
One government can not forever pass it's laws on others!

246
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:48,840
The streinght of Japan its in his history, and it is based on that history...

247
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:53,600
that we shall again rise to the dominant world powuh!

248
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:55,600
Is this cool or not?! I can't tell.

249
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:59,880
It is again time for the rising sun to ship tall in the sky!

250
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:03,200
One Japan! One society!

251
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:10,500
We will begin with language and exercise skills! Hajimete!!

252
00:13:11,255 --> 00:13:13,355
Ichi, ni, san, shi! Ichi, ni, san, shi!

253
00:13:14,774 --> 00:13:17,174
Ichi, ni, san, shi! Ichi, ni, san, shi!

254
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:24,000
Okay, children! I want it quiet!

255
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:29,080
Now, we're gonna try this again until we get it right! What is six times three?!

256
00:13:29,592 --> 00:13:30,881
Juuhachi desu ka? 
-Juuhachi da nee!

257
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:33,720
No, Goddammit! It's eighteen!

258
00:13:33,721 --> 00:13:34,721
"Juuhachi" is 18, Garrison-san.

259
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:37,920
For the last time, my name is not Garison san! Alright?!

260
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:43,120
And this is not Hat san! And you all better start talking in a matter that I can understand!

261
00:13:43,121 --> 00:13:44,921
Wuu, Garrison-san sabuchii dana!

262
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:45,900
What did he say?!

263
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:49,080
He said: "Garrison-san sabuchii dana!"
-Soo desu nee!

264
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:51,280
Dammit! This is not Japan!

265
00:13:51,281 --> 00:13:52,681
Minata! Kite kite, churi...!

266
00:13:55,316 --> 00:13:56,316
Dare ga pu shita no.

267
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,000
People, please! We can only speak one at a time!

268
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Now, Mr. Garison, you were saying!

269
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:09,000
I can't take it, Mayor! You have to put an end to this ChinpokoCamp!

270
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:11,000
My son hasn't made any sense in days!

271
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:15,000
I tell you, Mayor! These Japaneese are trying to change our American children somehow!

272
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:19,200
Alright, people! Mr. Hirohito and Mr. Hosek were nice enough to stop by to talk to you! Gentlemen!

273

That is why we make Chinpokomon Camp!

275
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:31,000
Well, how is it good?! We don't understand what the point of your product is!

276
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:34,000
There is nothing to worry about!

277

279
00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:42,040
You see, Japaneese penis is so small!
- So small!

280
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:46,240
You Americans have such humungous-burbous penis!

281
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:48,000
Well, I guess that's true!

282
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:51,000
Oh, such uh, nice big penis, American!

00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:56,400
What can we possibly do with such small penis?! We cannot take over your city

284
00:14:56,600 --> 00:15:00,040

00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:01,040
Well, he's got a point there!

286
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:03,040
Well, I guess that settles that!

287
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:05,040
We're sorry we took your time, gentlemen!

288
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:09,440
Oh, no! Thank you! Another chance to be in same room with big American penis!

00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:14,200
Nice guys!

291

So what are we going to do about our children?!

292
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:32,000
Okay, people! I know this Chin-poo-koo Man fad is causing a lot of problems! But I think we've already found a solution!

293
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:33,160
You have?!

294
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:37,200
Children are fickle! All we have to do is come up with a new fad!

295
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:40,200
We find the next toy and turn them all onto it as soon as possible!

296
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:42,200
Of course! That's a great idea!

297
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:43,200
But, what toy?!

298
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:45,400

00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:03,600
"Wild Wacky Action Bike! The bike that's hard to ride!"

305
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:07,000
Wild Wacky Action Bike is almost impossible to steer,

306
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:09,000
and it glows in the dark!

307
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:12,000
"Gonna try riding all day long, but I'm gonna"

308
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:15,600
"fail couse its Wild Wacky Action thing."

309
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:20,040
"Can't ride it! Can't ride it! Wile Wacky Action thing!"

310
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:23,600
Wild Wacky Action Bike comes with everything you see here!

311
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:28,000
Gay!
- Yeah, dude! That was totally gay!

312
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:31,880
Okay! Here's the next one!

313
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:34,920
Hey, kids! Do you like Chinpokomon?!

314
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:35,920
Yeah!

315
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:37,920
Then you're gonna love Alabama Man!

316
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:41,920
"Alabama Man! He's quick! He's strong! He's active!"

317
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:44,680
You can take Alabama Man to the bowling alley where he drinks heavily and chews tobacco!

318
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:46,920
Wow! He can bowl!

319
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:51,200
"He bowls and drinks! He drinks and bowls! Alabama Man!"

320
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:54,000
"When his Wife asks him where he's been, just use the action button "

321
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:55,600
"and Alabama Man busts her lip open!"

322
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:57,200
Shut up, bitch!

323
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:01,800
"He beat the wife and sleeps it off Alabama Man!"

324
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:05,240
-I wanna be just like Alabama Man!

325
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:07,240
Alabama Man comes with everything you see here! (Wife sold separately!)

326
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:10,240
-I though I told you to shut up!

327
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:12,400
(Not all people from Alabama are wife-beaters.)

328
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:17,600
-Gay! -Totally gay!
-Liberace gay!

329
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:22,000
Oh, dear! Well, let's keep trying! How 'bout this?!

330
00:17:23,995 --> 00:17:28,195
Owatta!
-Beikoku!

331
00:17:28,496 --> 00:17:30,696
Nihon en ima hajimaru!

332
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:33,600
Stan?! Stan, it's mommy!

333
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:38,200
Stanley! You need to get home right now! Mommy needs you!

334
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:41,600
Stanley! I'm talking to you!

335
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:46,116
Stan... Please! Come home!

336
00:17:46,116 --> 00:17:50,101
Kore wa watashi no uchi desu!
-So desu nee!

337
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Do not worry! Everythin is okay!

338
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
No it's not okay!

339
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,800
Oh! But you have such a large penis!

340
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:57,400
What?!

341
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:00,000
Your penis! Wow!

342
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:04,600
What he mean is that all men in this town have very large penis!

343
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:08,960
Can't you see what's happening?! They're just using that talk to distract you!

344
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,480
He doesn't really have a small penis!

345
00:18:10,974 --> 00:18:11,974
Misenasai!

346
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:21,960
My God! Is there nothing we can do?!

347
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,960
Wait a minute! Wait a minute! I think I know the answer!

348
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,480
I know how to get our kids to stop liking Chinpokomon!

349
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:27,400
How?!

350
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:29,400
C'mon! We don't have much time!

351
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:33,120
And now, for a special announcement from the President of the United States.

352
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:38,080
My fellow Americans, I wish to address the concerns many of us have

353
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:42,280
over the growing number of Japaneese military bases forming in the United States.

354
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:47,240
The new Japaneese Empiror Hirohito has made our own children into fighter pilots,

355
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:51,040
who will soon fly to Hawaii and and attack Pearl Harbor.

356
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:55,040
I spoke with Mr. Hirohito this morning and he assured me,

357
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:59,240
that I have a very large penis! He said it was mammoth, dinosauric,

358
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:03,040
and absolutely dwarfed his penis, which he assured me was nearly

359
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:07,080
microscopic in size. My penis, he said,

360
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:10,080
was most likely one of the biggest on the planet.

361
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:14,080
I applaud Mr. Hirohito in his honesty. Thank you.

362
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:18,680
Your plane will fly autopilot to Pearl Harbor! When you arive, you will drop many bombs!

363
00:19:18,681 --> 00:19:19,681
Hai, sachoo-san!

364
00:19:22,823 --> 00:19:23,823
Nan da kore?

365
00:19:23,888 --> 00:19:25,688
Chinpoko ga dai-suki yoo!

366
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:29,080
We just came to support you! We love Chinpokomon too!

367
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:31,080
It's super toy number one!

368
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:32,080
You like it?!
- You bet.

369
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:35,080
I think Chinpokeman is Chinpokarific! I've got Shoe!

370
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:39,080
C'mon, Eric! Let's try to battle your Roostor with my DonkeyTron!

371
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:41,080
Uh, no! That's okay, mom!

372
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:42,880
What are they doing?!
- It's a trick!

373
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:45,400
Hey, Stan! Look at my new bumpersticker!

374
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:47,200
Isn't that cool?!
-No!

375
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:52,400
Screw this, dude!
- Where're you going, Stan?!

376
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:54,400
I don't know! Chinpokomon just doesn't seem that cool anymore!

377
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:58,600
I'm gonna go kill some ants or something!
-Wait for me! I wanna get out of these stupid clothes!

378
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:04,400
Noooo!

379
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:08,800
Well, you were right, Sharron! The best way to make our kids not like something is to like it ourselves!

380
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:11,800
That's right! Anything we like is instantly not cool!

381
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:13,800
We know how to take 'em out, Mr. Garrison!

382
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:15,800
Spread the word! Get on the wire to every parent

383
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:20,000
around the country and tell 'em how to bring those sons of bitches down!

384
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:23,800
Hey, mom! I'm sorry we went a little nutty with that Chinpokomon stuff!

385
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:26,400
Can I have five dollars to buy a football?!
-You bet, Stanley!

386
00:20:28,006 --> 00:20:29,006
Owatta Beikoku!

387
00:20:30,865 --> 00:20:31,880
Kyle! It's over!

388
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:34,840
But I'm gonna be Royal Crown Chinpokomaster!

389
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:37,840
Dude, Chinpokomon isn't cool anymore! -What?
-Yeah, dude! That's way over!

390
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:39,840
Dude, you're just jealous because I'm Chinpokomaster!

391
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:41,840
No, Kyle! You see, we've learned something today!

392
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:44,840
This whole Chinpokomon thing happened because we all followed the group!

393
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:47,840
We only liked Chinpokomon because everyone else did! And look at the damage it cost!

394
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:51,840
So now, I should stop liking Chinpokomon because you all don't?!

395
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:52,800
Yep!

396
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:54,800
But if I stop now, I'd just be going with the group again!

397
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:57,600
So to be an individual, I have to bomb Pearl Harbor! See ya!

398
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:02,840
Oh! Wait! Actually, I was wrong! You see, Kyle, I learned something just now

399
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:05,840
It is good to go with the group! A group mentality is healthy sometimes!

400
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:08,000
Aw, screw it! I'm too confused!

401
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:12,600
Oh, I'm sure glad this is all over!

402
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:14,880
Hey! Get off of him! He's not dead yet!

403
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:21,760
No! Get off, you stupid rats! He's not dead yet!

404
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:23,760
Hey, you guys wanna go to the toy store after school and get some Spaceman Greg Cards?

405
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:25,720
Naw, I think I'm through with fads for a while.

406
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:28,240
Me too! I'm choosing my own toys from now on 'cause...

407
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:30,400
What the...

408
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,400
Oh, ho, ho, ho! Gross!

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
