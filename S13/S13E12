Piss off you stupid assholes!

Isn't this great food?

24
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:22,300
You're so right about this place.It's wonderful!

25
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:24,770
You know what's really interesting is that

26
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:42,710

00:01:55,790 --> 00:01:57,790
Everybody is checkin' us out.

29
00:01:57,790 --> 00:02:00,560
Yeah,they think we're pretty cool!

30
00:02:05,390 --> 00:02:07,870
We were definitely turnin' some heads out there!

31
00:02:07,870 --> 00:02:08,890
Yeah!

32
00:02:08,890 --> 00:02:13,440
I was pullin' back on that throttle,and everybody was like what is that?

33
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,310
For sure!

34
00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:19,080
Hey hey nobody here is really paying attention to us.

35
00:02:21,070 --> 00:02:22,910
That's weird.

36
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:34,890
Oh yeah,that's better.

37
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:54,130
Alright.Let's head out!

38
00:02:54,130 --> 00:02:55,670
- Alright! - Yeah,let's hit the streets!

39
00:02:55,670 --> 00:02:57,720
Fire'em up!

40
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,240
Excuse me!

41
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:03,810
Excuse me!

42
00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:05,790
Hey assholes!

43
00:03:07,070 --> 00:03:11,580
You guys know that everyone thinks you're total fags,right?

44
00:03:13,350 --> 00:03:14,660
What did you say?

45
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:16,420
You know when people like you drive down the streets

46
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:19,370
with your unnecessarily loud motorcycles thinking you're all cool,

47
00:03:19,370 --> 00:03:22,160
everyone is actually laughing at you and calling you pathetic faggots.

48
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:24,470
You do realize this,right?

49
00:03:25,490 --> 00:03:29,980
Hey man.We roll how we roll and if people are annoyed or intimidated by it,

50
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:32,530
that's too bad for them!

51
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:36,790
No,no,nobody is intimidated,actually.

52
00:03:36,790 --> 00:03:39,720
Everyone realizes that people who are so needy for attention,

53
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:41,690
they need to dress up and be as loud as possible

54
00:03:41,690 --> 00:03:44,310
are you guys and sixteen year old girls.

55
00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:47,560
Just wanted to let you know you're Fags.

56
00:03:52,310 --> 00:03:53,670
That.

57
00:03:53,670 --> 00:03:57,180
that little boy just called us fags.

58
00:03:57,180 --> 00:03:59,400
Like he didn't think we were cool.

59
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:01,060
But he's wrong!

60
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:03,060
People don't think we're fags!Do they?

61
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:04,250
Course he's wrong!

62
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:05,410
And anyway,

63
00:04:05,410 --> 00:04:09,110
nobody except that little freak would ever say something like that to our faces!

64
00:04:09,110 --> 00:04:10,740
That's right!

65
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:12,770
Come on.Let's roll!

66
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:15,510
- Rev'em up! - Here ow go!

67
00:04:35,090 --> 00:04:37,540
us Just just ignore him!

68
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:47,150
**

69
00:04:47,610 --> 00:04:49,590
God dammit,this is Up!

70
00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:52,070
What's wrong with kids today?

71
00:04:56,710 --> 00:04:58,750
It doesn't make any sense.

72
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:00,980
They all called us fags.

73
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:04,530
How can they call us fags?I mean,listen to this!

74
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:07,480
I know.I know.

75
00:05:07,510 --> 00:05:10,970
Look,guys I think I know what the problem is here.

76
00:05:10,970 --> 00:05:11,790
- Really? - You do?

77
00:05:11,790 --> 00:05:14,290
- What? - Yeah,think about it guys!

78
00:05:14,290 --> 00:05:16,360
You see all the things kids have today?

79
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:20,100
I mean,with their xboxes and surround sound entertainment systems.

80
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:23,360
Kids today are surrounded by big loud stuff all the time.

81
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,960
Hey that's right!

82
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,520
That's all it is guys.

83
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:29,670
We just need to get a little louder.That's all!

84
00:05:33,970 --> 00:05:36,100
Broflovski looks for kenny to get clear for the pass.

85
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:38,390
But cartman just isn't letting up on him!

86
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:41,000
Oh,what the hell.

87
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:54,100
Chicken spears.Chicken spears.Chicken spears.

88
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:56,500
Chicken spears.Chicken spears.

89
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:59,020
God dammit,god dammit!

90
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:02,590
Now we're turnin' some heads!

91
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:06,150
Let's see them call us fags now!

92
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:10,360
Alright.Thanks for coming,everyone.

93
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:13,090
As you all know,the harley problem seems to be getting worse,

94
00:06:13,090 --> 00:06:15,200
and nobody is willing to do anything about it.

95
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:16,460
- Yes. - Agreed.

96
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:20,220
I have had it with those loud annoying ffffaggots.

97
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:23,850
Now we have some ideas.We'd love to hear your ideas and I think that together we

98
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:30,020
And I think that together we can come up

99
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:31,280
with a way to get rid of these fags once and for all.

100
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:32,490
- Sounds good. - Okay.****

101
00:06:32,490 --> 00:06:34,200
- ********** - What are you guys talking about?

102
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:37,310
- Harley's are neato! - What?

103
00:06:37,310 --> 00:06:40,250
I always thought someday when I grow up I'm gonna get a harley!

104
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:41,790
Then people will have to notice me!

105
00:06:41,790 --> 00:06:44,650
And they'll have to deal with my For once!

106
00:06:44,650 --> 00:06:45,890
The open road!

107
00:06:45,890 --> 00:06:47,300
The wind in my face!

108
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:49,970
I'll go from city to city!

109
00:06:51,370 --> 00:06:52,950
Everyone lookin' at me!

110
00:06:52,950 --> 00:06:54,170
Who's that guy?

111
00:06:54,170 --> 00:06:57,370
He must be a he must be tough!

112
00:06:58,650 --> 00:07:01,500
I'll have my girl on the back seat,holdin' on to my fat belly.

113
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:04,790
Sure,she's missin' a few teeth,but she's thinks I'm cool!

114
00:07:04,790 --> 00:07:06,250
That's why when I grow up.

115
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:09,200
I'm gonna be a harley rider.

116
00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:12,110
That makes perfect sense,butters.

117
00:07:12,110 --> 00:07:13,170
It does?

118
00:07:13,170 --> 00:07:14,570
Yes.Now get out of here.

119
00:07:14,570 --> 00:07:16,190
Okay.

120
00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:18,700
Alright.Kyle and I are going to spray paint messages to the harley riders.

121
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:20,060
Cartman,you said you had an idea?

122
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:22,510
I think what I'm going to do is find out wherever there bikes are and,

123
00:07:22,510 --> 00:07:23,580
uh,crap on their seats.

124
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:25,460
- Oh,that's good. - Yeah,I think that'll be nice.

125
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:27,290
But that's a lot of seats how are you going to pull that off?

126
00:07:27,290 --> 00:07:30,930
I think I just need two,maybe three buckets of kfc,extra crispy.

127
00:07:30,930 --> 00:07:32,780
Probably four cartons of gravy?

128
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:34,500
Clyde can you take care of getting the kfc for cartman,

129
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:36,150
kyle and I can get the spray paint cans.

130
00:07:36,150 --> 00:07:40,610
If we do this right,we'll be doing the town a huge favor so let's get to it!

131
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:47,010
That was a good breakfast!

132
00:07:47,010 --> 00:07:48,920
I'm full!

133
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:54,240
You guys smell that?

134
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:58,090
It smells like that new 'famous bowl' at kfc.

135
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:02,630
Somebody took a On my Harley!

136
00:08:02,630 --> 00:08:04,140
What?

137
00:08:04,770 --> 00:08:08,750
Me too!I got All over my pants now!

138
00:08:10,130 --> 00:08:13,110
There's little flags stuck in the !

139
00:08:13,110 --> 00:08:14,930
You're fags.

140
00:08:14,930 --> 00:08:16,890
You gotta be kiddin' me!

141
00:08:16,890 --> 00:08:20,280
Come on!We'll find the bastards who did this!

142
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:46,220
This can't be happening!

143
00:08:49,190 --> 00:08:50,290
Really nice work,guys.

144
00:08:50,290 --> 00:08:53,040
Yeah,I think maybe everything is gonna be okay now.

145
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:57,380
So I said to the guy,you really think I'm paying that much?

146
00:08:57,380 --> 00:08:59,800
Oh,jesus christ.

147
00:09:00,810 --> 00:09:03,250
Oh my god.

148
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:06,970
I thought we were past this.

149
00:09:07,870 --> 00:09:11,680
Students,I am here because of a very serious matter.

150
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:15,200
This morning it was discovered that in several places all over town,

151
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:19,480
somebody had spray painted the words 'fags get out.

152
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:22,420
Many witnesses reported seeing children with spray paint.

153
00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:26,560
Now,if anybody knows anything about the kids who did this,you must come forward.

154
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:28,200
That was us!

155
00:09:28,910 --> 00:09:31,830
- Excuse me? - Yeah,we did that.

156
00:09:33,070 --> 00:09:36,700
Why would you write something like that and be proud of it?

157
00:09:37,190 --> 00:09:39,500
cuz we want all those fags to get out of our town.

158
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:41,610
Yeah,everyone hates those fags,right?

159
00:09:41,610 --> 00:09:43,320
- I hate fags! - I do

160
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:45,340
Now just what the heck is going on here?

161
00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:47,640
That is not what we have taught you in this school.

162
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:51,400
Kyle and stan,you've always been tolerant of gay people!

163
00:09:52,070 --> 00:09:55,200
- Gay people? - We aren't talking about gay people.

164
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:58,350
You just admitted to spray painting that they should get out of town!

165
00:09:58,350 --> 00:10:00,290
Dude,why we would we want gay people to get out of town?

166
00:10:00,290 --> 00:10:02,760
Ohh,they think we meant gay fags.

167
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:04,510
Hey,that's not very nice,mayor.

168
00:10:04,510 --> 00:10:07,650
Just because a person is gay doesn't mean he's a fag.

169
00:10:07,650 --> 00:10:08,930
What?

170
00:10:08,930 --> 00:10:12,440
You four boys in my office,now!

171
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:14,480
******

172
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:21,250
Faggot,often shortened to fag,

173
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:25,790
has been used in the english language since the late 16th century.

174
00:10:25,790 --> 00:10:30,850
Its original meaning was an old or unpleasant woman.

175
00:10:30,850 --> 00:10:33,060
That certainly don't apply to us!

176
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:37,500
Faggot later was defined as a bundle of sticks,

177
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:41,070
and in the 19th century a 'faggot gatherer'

178
00:10:41,070 --> 00:10:45,080
was someone who made a meager living gathering firewood.

179
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:48,130
Well,they certainly ain't callin' us fags cuz we gather sticks!

180
00:10:48,130 --> 00:10:50,240
There's got to be more to this!

181
00:10:56,810 --> 00:10:58,820
What's that part say there?

182
00:10:58,820 --> 00:11:04,220
Later,the term fag was defined as any awkward bundle to be carried,

183
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:09,870
and was often used as an insult to the elderly,as in calling them 'baggage.

184
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:14,890
Fag was used as an insult to women,then poor people,then old people?

185
00:11:14,890 --> 00:11:17,130
In the early 1900s,

186
00:11:17,130 --> 00:11:23,850
the word became a pejoritive term against homosexuals and transgender people

187
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:25,900
in the united states.

188
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:28,590
That word just keeps changing its meaning!

189
00:11:28,590 --> 00:11:31,060
What's it got to do with us?

190
00:11:38,370 --> 00:11:40,940
We are really trying to understand this.

191
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:43,920
How is it that you boys think referring to gay people as 'fags'

192
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:46,260
in today's world is acceptable?

193
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:48,400
Because we're not referring to gay people.

194
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:50,050
You can be gay and not be a fag.

195
00:11:50,050 --> 00:11:51,540
Yeah,a lot of fags aren't gay.

196
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:52,760
I happen to be gay,boys.

197
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:55,140
Do you think I'm a fag?

198
00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:56,340
Do you ride a big,loud harley

199
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:59,450
and go up and down the streets ruining everyone's nice time?

200
00:11:59,450 --> 00:12:00,690
No.

201
00:12:00,690 --> 00:12:02,680
Then you're not a fag.

202
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:06,880
So what if a guy is gay and rides a harley?

203
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:07,960
Then he's a gay fag.

204
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:09,330
I mean,is this really this hard?

205
00:12:09,330 --> 00:12:12,890
- I don't know. - This is Ridiculous.

206
00:12:12,890 --> 00:12:14,720
Alright.Look,you're driving in your car,okay?

207
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:16,860
And you're waiting to make a left at a traffic signal.

208
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:18,730
The light turns yellow.Should be your turn to go.

209
00:12:18,730 --> 00:12:20,700
But the traffic coming at you just keeps coming.

210
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:22,000
And even when the light turns red,

211
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,900
a guy in a bmw runs the red light so you can't make your left turn.

212
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:26,770
What goes through your mind?

213
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:29,440
Fag.

214
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:32,240
Right.But you're not thinking 'oh he's homosexual',

215
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:35,760
you're thinking 'oh he's an inconsiderate douche bag like a harley rider.

216
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:39,390
This.this is making insanely good sense to me.

217
00:12:39,390 --> 00:12:40,670
Alright.How about this:

218
00:12:40,670 --> 00:12:43,630
What would you call a straight man who doesn't own a harley,

219
00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:46,330
but likes them and might buy one someday.

220
00:12:46,330 --> 00:12:48,550
You call him bike curious.

221
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:50,340
- Bikecur  - Bike curious!

222
00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:52,070
Don't you people keep up with today's lingo at all?

223
00:12:52,070 --> 00:12:54,550
Jesus Christ.

224
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:58,710
Fellow homosexuals.

225
00:12:58,710 --> 00:13:03,840
I believe we have an opportunity here to take a big step forward for our kind.

226
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:09,260
We must acknowledge that the words fag and faggot are never going to disappear.

227
00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:12,400
They are simply too much fun for everyone to say.

228
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:16,650
But we must realize that we are no longer the most hated people on the planet.

229
00:13:16,650 --> 00:13:19,850
And help the children change the meaning of the word

230
00:13:19,850 --> 00:13:23,900
to describe those annoying,loud,faggot harley riders!

231
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:25,580
Here,here!

232
00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:29,120
We should all be tolerant but not with these People.

233
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:31,460
They really are faggots.

234
00:13:31,460 --> 00:13:33,540
Yes!Jesus yes!

235
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:36,100
This is channel 4 evening news.

236
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:40,370
A new movement in south park is bringing to question the word 'fag.

237
00:13:40,370 --> 00:13:44,050
' Gay groups are pointing out that the word no longer means to kids today,

238
00:13:44,050 --> 00:13:46,400
what it meant just a few years ago.

239
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:48,650
And what's your name little boy?

240
00:13:48,650 --> 00:13:49,850
Martin.

241
00:13:49,850 --> 00:13:51,840
Alright,martin.Can you do me a favor?

242
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:54,950
Could you point to the fag for me?

243
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:59,880
Just point to which one is the fag.

244
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:06,600
Alright.Now,could you just point to the fag for me,little girl?

245
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:09,090
Which one is a faggot.

246
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:16,420
Sparked by this realization,and persuaded by gay advocate groups,

247
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:18,770
the mayor signed a new city ordinance today

248
00:14:18,770 --> 00:14:25,170
making the word fag officially refer to annoying,inconsiderate harley riders.

249
00:14:25,170 --> 00:14:28,920
How do you fags feel about the new city ordinance?

250
00:14:29,390 --> 00:14:30,730
What did you say?

251
00:14:30,730 --> 00:14:34,930
Just asking if you feel okay or displeased about the ordinance,fag.

252
00:14:34,930 --> 00:14:35,940
Hey,you know what?

253
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:38,370
If you call me fag to my face one more time,you better

254
00:14:38,370 --> 00:14:39,850
I already did it twice.

255
00:14:39,850 --> 00:14:43,500
Well,I think that I think that you you probably you won't say it again.

256
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:44,580
I bet I do.

257
00:14:44,580 --> 00:14:46,980
- Well,okay. - Fag.

258
00:14:48,290 --> 00:14:52,000
As more people in south park adapt to the new meaning

259
00:14:53,130 --> 00:14:54,900
Fags!

260
00:14:56,530 --> 00:15:00,880
More and more harley riders are deciding to ride elsewhere.

261
00:15:02,850 --> 00:15:04,670
Oh,yeah.Nice,kenny.

262
00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:05,950
Isn't this awesome,you guys?

263
00:15:05,950 --> 00:15:08,120
I haven't seen a harley for like three days!

264
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:10,550
I know!It's like we have the outdoors back again!

265
00:15:10,550 --> 00:15:14,310
You four turdballs,in my office.Now!

266
00:15:15,570 --> 00:15:17,290
crap.

267
00:15:17,430 --> 00:15:20,090
You have gotten me in a lot of trouble!

268
00:15:20,090 --> 00:15:24,710
The fact of the matter is that fag is still defined in the dictionary

269
00:15:24,710 --> 00:15:27,320
as a pejorative term against homosexuals.

270
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:30,730
And so you are still causing harm to gay people everywhere,

271
00:15:30,730 --> 00:15:33,150
whether you mean it differently or not.

272
00:15:33,150 --> 00:15:35,970
The town of south park and its mayor have once again shown themselves

273
00:15:35,970 --> 00:15:39,400
to be completely out of touch with the progressive world.

274
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:41,540
She's gaining support all over the country!

275
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:43,150
I should have never listened to you!

276
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:44,320
We're sorry,mayor.

277
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:45,540
Oh,that's nice.

278
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:49,380
You made our entire town look like gaybashing redneck homophobes,

279
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:51,010
but at least you're sorry!

280
00:15:51,010 --> 00:15:52,200
We can fix this!

281
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:53,200
How?

282
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:56,620
That lady said it's because fag still means homosexual in the dictionary.

283
00:15:56,620 --> 00:15:59,600
So we just have to convince the dictionary people to change the definition.

284
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:00,810
Hey,yeah.

285
00:16:00,810 --> 00:16:04,960
Then people would be free to call harley riders fags all over the country!

286
00:16:11,490 --> 00:16:14,620
Now I don't know about you,but I think that town is starting a trend.

287
00:16:14,620 --> 00:16:19,190
And if we let them officially change the meaning of fag from gay people to us,

288
00:16:19,190 --> 00:16:21,760
then soon every town might!

289
00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:28,970
If we don't do anything we could end up

290
00:16:29,050 --> 00:16:32,480
If we don't do anything we could

291
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:33,950
Hey,bartlett!

292
00:16:33,950 --> 00:16:35,430
Bartlett!

293
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:38,180
I'm trying to talk ya,fag!

294
00:16:40,180 --> 00:16:42,740
Aw,see!Now they got us doing it to ourselves!

295
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:44,870
We gotta put a stop to this now!

296
00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:49,340
So I say we ride into that town and kick some Ass!

297
00:17:02,630 --> 00:17:04,040
Excitement is in the air,

298
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:06,260
as the citizens of south park amass

299
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:11,400
to see if the word fag will officially be changed in the english dictionary.

300
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:15,150
Four local boys will state their case to the head dictionary editor,

301
00:17:15,150 --> 00:17:20,060
and if they succeed fag will officially refer to harley riders nationwide.

302
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:21,410
You can do it,boys!

303
00:17:21,410 --> 00:17:23,000
We believe in you!

304
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:27,120
And tom,it looks as though the dictionary officials have arrived!

305
00:17:27,230 --> 00:17:30,090
Entering the scene now are the keepers of the current dictionary

306
00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:35,390
and of course the dictionary's head editor mr.Emmanuel lewewis.

307
00:17:36,150 --> 00:17:37,480
Emmanuel lewis,huh?

308
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:39,800
Oh,it all makes sense now.

309
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:49,350
To change the definition of a word is no trifling thing!

310
00:17:49,350 --> 00:17:53,700
I expect this proposal,for changing the definition of the word fag,

311
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:57,510
to be both discerning and undisputable.

312
00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:00,280
Come on boys,you can do it!

313
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:09,600
Look out!There's a bunch of pissed off faggots!

314
00:18:23,980 --> 00:18:25,320
There's fags everywhere!

315
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:27,100
We gotta run!

316
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:38,040
What nefariousness is this?

317
00:18:38,140 --> 00:18:40,520
You obdurate beasts!

318
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:02,000
Now do you think we're fags?!

319
00:19:02,370 --> 00:19:04,900
Yes!Yes,sir,you are total fags!

320
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:07,170
yeah!You definitely made your point.

321
00:19:07,170 --> 00:19:11,060
No!We rolled in,kicked ass and took Over.
