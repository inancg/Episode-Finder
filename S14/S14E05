La Fabrique

2
00:00:33,783 --> 00:00:36,870
Our factory works 24/7
to produce candy,

3
00:00:36,995 --> 00:00:39,289
and we have over 500 employees.

4
00:00:39,414 --> 00:00:42,541
Here you can see where the cocoa
is mixed with the sugar and milk.

5
00:00:45,128 --> 00:00:47,672
- Chocolate rules.
- You should know, fat ass.

6
00:00:48,048 --> 00:00:50,216
I'm not fat, you sneaky Jew!

7
00:00:50,341 --> 00:00:51,926
God, really?
This again?

8
00:00:52,094 --> 00:00:54,346
Here is where the fudge
is put into boxes

9
00:00:54,471 --> 00:00:56,263
to be shipped all over the world.

10
00:00:56,681 --> 00:00:58,558
Like Cartman's dad
shipped out on him.

11
00:00:58,683 --> 00:01:01,227
I have a dad, butthole!
My mom is my dad!

12
00:01:01,352 --> 00:01:04,814
You guys, stop!
You're just rehashing old stuff!

13
00:01:06,566 --> 00:01:08,193
Isn't that Tom Cruise?

14
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:11,947
It is!

15
00:01:12,072 --> 00:01:14,323
Check it out.
Tom Cruise is a fudge packer.

16
00:01:15,325 --> 00:01:16,450
What did you say?

17
00:01:17,786 --> 00:01:18,953
That is Tom Cruise!

18
00:01:19,579 --> 00:01:21,664
How come you're packin' fudge,
Mr. Cruise?

19
00:01:22,207 --> 00:01:24,166
I'm not a fudge packer!

20
00:01:25,418 --> 00:01:27,002
Don't be ashamed or anything.

21
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:30,172
- But I'm not a fudge packer!
- Then why are you packing fudge?

22
00:01:30,757 --> 00:01:33,134
I'm not.
I'm a very busy actor!

23
00:01:33,259 --> 00:01:36,679
I'm just here trying to get away
for a weekend and do some fly fishing!

24
00:01:37,931 --> 00:01:40,141
You are in a fudge factory
packing fudge.

25
00:01:40,558 --> 00:01:42,601
That does it.
I will sue you!

26
00:01:42,769 --> 00:01:46,397
- For what?
- You can't just get away with it!

27
00:01:46,773 --> 00:01:48,691
Is that fudge packer Tom Cruise?

28
00:01:48,983 --> 00:01:52,069
That's it!
I'm suing this entire intolerant town!

29
00:01:52,237 --> 00:01:53,571
- But...
- No buts!

30
00:01:53,696 --> 00:01:55,907
You wanna accuse somebody
of being a fudge packer,

31
00:01:56,032 --> 00:01:57,617
you'll pay the consequences!

32
00:01:59,244 --> 00:02:01,746
I wanna really thank you all
for coming.

33
00:02:01,914 --> 00:02:06,126
Shockingly, I've just been slandered
once again in the town of South Park,

34
00:02:06,251 --> 00:02:08,335
something I know
you all can relate to.

35
00:02:08,753 --> 00:02:11,338
- Sure can!
- I can't believe it!

36
00:02:11,506 --> 00:02:14,675
That town just seems to be
a hotbed of hatred and lies!

37
00:02:14,843 --> 00:02:18,053
I'm fed up with it.
They suggested I was made of shit.

38
00:02:18,638 --> 00:02:20,890
I was just over there
doing some fly fishing,

39
00:02:21,015 --> 00:02:23,726
and this little boy walks up
and calls me a fudge packer!

40
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:26,270
- That's crazy!
- So wrong!

41
00:02:26,438 --> 00:02:27,564
I know, right?

42
00:02:27,897 --> 00:02:31,066
And other kids in the town
and their teacher start joining in!

43
00:02:31,234 --> 00:02:33,695
South Park, Colorado
is the most insensitive,

44
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:36,280
racist and bigoted place
in this country!

45
00:02:36,656 --> 00:02:40,075
That town think they can say anything
and get away with it.

46
00:02:40,243 --> 00:02:43,454
If anybody has a gripe
against that shit hole, it's me.

47
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:46,582
I say enough.

48
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:48,585
All of us together can put a stop

49
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:51,212
to the slander coming from that town
once and for all!

50
00:02:51,337 --> 00:02:54,256
No longer will they make snide remarks
about whoever they want!

51
00:02:56,593 --> 00:02:58,761
I ate too much Subway.
Where's your bathroom?

52
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:01,013
Just the door down the hall there.

53
00:03:02,182 --> 00:03:03,682
That's a closet.
Go down.

54
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:06,060
A closet too.

55
00:03:07,396 --> 00:03:08,646
That one's a closet.

56
00:03:10,398 --> 00:03:11,691
That's a closet.

57
00:03:12,483 --> 00:03:13,776
That's a closet.

58
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:21,576
<i>Stan Marsh to the Principal's office,
Stan Marsh come immediately.</i>

59
00:03:21,701 --> 00:03:24,120
- What'd you do?
- I have no idea.

60
00:03:30,126 --> 00:03:32,295
You just had to push it, didn't you?

61
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:34,964
You just had
to make fun of Tom Cruise again!

62
00:03:35,423 --> 00:03:37,383
Did you call him a fudge packer?

63
00:03:38,676 --> 00:03:40,135
He was packing fudge!

64
00:03:40,303 --> 00:03:43,723
Little boy, you don't understand
how serious this is.

65
00:03:43,848 --> 00:03:46,976
Tom Cruise has put together
a class action lawsuit

66
00:03:47,101 --> 00:03:49,729
along with 200 other celebrities!

67
00:03:49,854 --> 00:03:53,399
They're going to sue
the bejeezus out of this entire town.

68
00:03:53,567 --> 00:03:56,402
It wasn't just me.
Other kids did, even Mr. Garrison.

69
00:03:56,570 --> 00:03:57,904
But you started it.

70
00:03:58,029 --> 00:03:59,989
Mr. Broflovski,
tell him what you told us.

71
00:04:00,865 --> 00:04:03,952
A class action lawsuit
means the end of this town.

72
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:06,245
We can't possibly go up
against their lawyers.

73
00:04:06,537 --> 00:04:10,041
Dammit, Marsh, why couldn't you
have kept your stupid, ugly kid in line?

74
00:04:10,166 --> 00:04:12,167
Don't start blaming me
for his looks!

75
00:04:15,171 --> 00:04:18,133
Mr. Cruise, my son is so, so sorry,

76
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:21,469
and he would do anything
to take back his hurtful comments.

77
00:04:21,594 --> 00:04:24,180
That's nice.
I'm still suing you all!

78
00:04:24,305 --> 00:04:26,390
Nobody calls me a fudge packer!

79
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:29,060
It was a terrible mistake.

80
00:04:29,352 --> 00:04:31,562
But maybe you could see how...

81
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:33,356
Since you do...

82
00:04:33,773 --> 00:04:36,859
take fudge and pack it into a box...

83
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,570
What?

84
00:04:38,695 --> 00:04:42,656
I'm just saying
that you are employed currently...

85
00:04:42,991 --> 00:04:44,659
as a person who...

86
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:46,327
packages...

87
00:04:46,495 --> 00:04:49,121
I'm an actor!
I do not pack fudge.

88
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:53,668
Right.
My son just got confused,

89
00:04:54,043 --> 00:04:56,170
because you have a little uniform,

90
00:04:56,462 --> 00:04:59,173
and a hat that says
"Fred's Fudge and Candies."

91
00:04:59,549 --> 00:05:00,675
And you are...

92
00:05:01,175 --> 00:05:04,554
It doesn't matter.
Just please withdraw the lawsuit.

93
00:05:04,679 --> 00:05:07,264
Nobody in our town
will ever call you a fudge packer again.

94
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:09,934
There is...

95
00:05:10,601 --> 00:05:12,729
one thing that your town could do...

96
00:05:13,104 --> 00:05:15,148
to maybe make me forget
about this lawsuit.

97
00:05:15,273 --> 00:05:17,734
Anything!
Anything you want!

98
00:05:18,109 --> 00:05:20,445
There's somebody
I've always wanted to meet.

99
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:21,696
Face to face.

100
00:05:21,821 --> 00:05:24,908
- If you could get him in your town...
- Sure! Who is it?

101
00:05:25,033 --> 00:05:26,408
We can get anybody!

102
00:05:26,951 --> 00:05:28,036
Muhammad.

103
00:05:28,369 --> 00:05:30,329
The prophet of the Muslim faith.

104
00:05:33,041 --> 00:05:34,500
That's tricky.

105
00:05:34,668 --> 00:05:36,419
Then you can just get sued!

106
00:05:36,544 --> 00:05:39,255
If there's anybody else
we could bring to town we could...

107
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:40,673
Just him!

108
00:05:40,798 --> 00:05:44,177
You get Muhammad to appear
or your little town is done!

109
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:49,306
People, I know!

110
00:05:50,141 --> 00:05:54,312
But he will get the other celebrities
to withdraw their lawsuit if we...

111
00:05:54,562 --> 00:05:56,730
get Muhammad
to appear in South Park.

112
00:05:57,065 --> 00:05:58,149
Are you nuts?

113
00:05:58,274 --> 00:06:00,944
If Muhammad appears in South Park,
we get bombed!

114
00:06:01,069 --> 00:06:02,695
- That's right!
- You tell 'em.

115
00:06:03,071 --> 00:06:04,364
We don't know that!

116
00:06:04,489 --> 00:06:07,783
Maybe enough time has passed
that now it's okay to show Muhammad.

117
00:06:07,951 --> 00:06:11,036
I can't believe we are dealing
with this Muhammad thing again.

118
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:13,873
But even if it were safe now
for Muhammad to come,

119
00:06:13,998 --> 00:06:15,749
how would we ever find him?

120
00:06:16,292 --> 00:06:19,420
Showing an image of him
is completely off limits and censored,

121
00:06:19,545 --> 00:06:22,090
so nobody has ever seen
what Muhammad looks like!

122
00:06:23,132 --> 00:06:24,300
I saw him once.

123
00:06:26,344 --> 00:06:27,595
You did?

124
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:30,014
A while ago,
my friends joined David Blaine's cult.

125
00:06:30,139 --> 00:06:33,518
I had to go to the Super Best Friends.
Muhammad was one of them.

126
00:06:34,352 --> 00:06:37,813
And he was out in the open
and nobody got bombed?

127
00:06:38,189 --> 00:06:39,231
It was fine.

128
00:06:39,565 --> 00:06:41,900
Muhammad showed up
and there was no violence at all?

129
00:06:42,193 --> 00:06:44,653
A giant John Wilkes Booth
shot Abraham Lincoln...

130
00:06:44,821 --> 00:06:46,155
That's enough!

131
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:48,783
Jesus, you can't learn to shut up,
can you?

132
00:06:49,283 --> 00:06:51,744
Now look,
I believe we can find Muhammad.

133
00:06:51,869 --> 00:06:54,372
I've done a lot of research
and I've completed a sketch

134
00:06:54,497 --> 00:06:56,623
of what Muhammad
could look like today.

135
00:06:56,791 --> 00:06:57,624
Don't!

136
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:03,840
Is that okay to show?

137
00:07:03,965 --> 00:07:06,509
I don't know.
I guess we'll see.

138
00:07:08,636 --> 00:07:11,972
What is up with this Muhammad thing?
It doesn't make sense.

139
00:07:12,598 --> 00:07:15,184
You said we were
just suing South Park!

140
00:07:16,227 --> 00:07:18,229
I said we were going
to use South Park

141
00:07:18,354 --> 00:07:20,481
to make sure
we never got ripped on again.

142
00:07:21,149 --> 00:07:23,943
Look, people, all of us
get ridiculed,

143
00:07:24,068 --> 00:07:26,404
but who is
the one person on this earth

144
00:07:26,529 --> 00:07:28,739
that is completely free
from slander?

145
00:07:29,198 --> 00:07:31,993
You want Muhammad
because he can't be ridiculed?

146
00:07:32,535 --> 00:07:36,164
He has a power that makes him
impervious to being made fun of.

147
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:39,041
What if we could harness that power?

148
00:07:41,544 --> 00:07:45,798
What if nobody could call your music
drunken frat boy monkey garbage?

149
00:07:46,591 --> 00:07:47,967
I'd love it.

150
00:07:48,092 --> 00:07:51,220
By taking what Muhammad has,
we would all be safe from ridicule.

151
00:07:51,388 --> 00:07:52,805
Like Tim Burton here!

152
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:54,015
Imagine it.

153
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:57,143
Nobody could rip on you
for all your rehashed movies lately.

154
00:07:57,268 --> 00:08:01,189
No TV show would point out
you're unoriginal since <i>Beetlejuice</i>

155
00:08:01,314 --> 00:08:03,941
and you always put Johnny Depp
and the same crappy music

156
00:08:04,066 --> 00:08:06,903
and that if you love Johnny Depp,
you should have sex with him.

157
00:08:07,028 --> 00:08:08,905
A TV show could never say that?

158
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,864
Gee, that'd be swell.

159
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:12,492
It can be a reality.

160
00:08:12,617 --> 00:08:15,744
Once we have Muhammad,
we can take his power from him!

161
00:08:16,078 --> 00:08:17,121
Excuse me.

162
00:08:17,997 --> 00:08:20,041
This is the home
of Tom Cruise, right?

163
00:08:21,209 --> 00:08:23,585
It's one of the kids
from South Park that slandered me!

164
00:08:23,753 --> 00:08:25,129
I didn't come for me.

165
00:08:25,254 --> 00:08:28,758
I'm just an escort for another celebrity
who wants to get in on your lawsuit.

166
00:08:29,217 --> 00:08:30,217
Who?

167
00:08:35,181 --> 00:08:36,641
Jennifer Lopez!

168
00:08:40,061 --> 00:08:43,648
I am Jennifer Lopez
and I like tacos and burritos!

169
00:08:48,069 --> 00:08:50,363


170
00:08:54,242 --> 00:08:56,661
<i>In the great hall
of the Super Best Friends,</i>

171
00:08:56,786 --> 00:08:59,955
<i>there are assembled the leaders
of the world's biggest religions!</i>

172
00:09:00,623 --> 00:09:01,498
<i>Jesus!</i>

173
00:09:02,667 --> 00:09:03,709
<i>Buddha!</i>

174
00:09:05,503 --> 00:09:06,795
<i>Krishna!</i>

175
00:09:08,214 --> 00:09:09,298
<i>Muhammad!</i>

176
00:09:11,008 --> 00:09:12,843
<i>Lao Tsu and Joseph Smith!</i>

177
00:09:13,762 --> 00:09:15,513
<i>And the mighty Semen!</i>

178
00:09:15,638 --> 00:09:17,807
It's not Semen.
It's Seaman!

179
00:09:17,932 --> 00:09:18,974
<i>Their mission,</i>

180
00:09:19,142 --> 00:09:21,018
<i>to right that which is wrong</i>

181
00:09:21,143 --> 00:09:23,396
<i>and to serve all mankind!</i>

182
00:09:26,941 --> 00:09:29,860
All we're asking is to bring
Muhammad to our town for an hour.

183
00:09:30,028 --> 00:09:32,779
My son, much has changed
since you were last here.

184
00:09:33,072 --> 00:09:35,532
Muhammad cannot make
public appearances.

185
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:39,119
We simply cannot risk
any violence from the Muslim people.

186
00:09:39,745 --> 00:09:41,164
Not you guys too!

187
00:09:41,289 --> 00:09:42,999
Jesus fucking Christ!

188
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:49,005
<i>Later, at the hall
of the Super Best Friends...</i>

189
00:09:50,464 --> 00:09:54,092
Will you let him come to South Park
if we dress him up like a pirate?

190
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:57,346
Muslims would still be angry
you showed his face.

191
00:09:58,097 --> 00:10:00,224
What if we cover his face
with a paper bag?

192
00:10:01,017 --> 00:10:04,561
You'd still show him walking around.
That could be trouble.

193
00:10:04,895 --> 00:10:08,607
A suit of armor,
so that you can't see anything.

194
00:10:08,775 --> 00:10:12,027
But it's still Muhammad
walking around in human form.

195
00:10:12,403 --> 00:10:14,071
Come on, this is ridiculous!

196
00:10:14,239 --> 00:10:18,201
Boys, you must understand that people
get very offended when he is mocked,

197
00:10:18,326 --> 00:10:20,077
because he is a religious figure!

198
00:10:22,538 --> 00:10:25,040
Buddha,
don't do coke in front of kids!

199
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:29,295
A U-Haul.
What if we bring him in a U-Haul

200
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:31,255
and he stays in there out of sight?

201
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:33,632
But he's talking from the U-Haul?

202
00:10:34,175 --> 00:10:36,051
He has to,
or nobody knows he's in there!

203
00:10:36,552 --> 00:10:39,639
Hearing his voice, I dunno.
What do you think, Moses?

204
00:10:42,224 --> 00:10:44,518
Would there be windows
on the U-Haul?

205
00:10:45,102 --> 00:10:46,436
There doesn't have to be.

206
00:10:48,272 --> 00:10:49,273
I guess...

207
00:10:49,774 --> 00:10:51,734
I guess that would be okay.

208
00:10:55,071 --> 00:10:56,154
Here it is!

209
00:10:56,322 --> 00:10:58,950
Once we have Muhammad,
this machine will give us his power

210
00:10:59,075 --> 00:11:00,659
to not be made fun of.

211
00:11:01,452 --> 00:11:02,954
You're talking crazy.

212
00:11:03,079 --> 00:11:06,749
Only Muhammad has that ability.
How could we ever get it from him?

213
00:11:07,291 --> 00:11:08,793
We take his goo.

214
00:11:11,837 --> 00:11:13,547
It's as simple as that.

215
00:11:15,508 --> 00:11:17,802
Rob Reiner has been telling me
about the goo

216
00:11:17,927 --> 00:11:19,970
which is inside
every person on earth.

217
00:11:20,138 --> 00:11:22,807
Any goo can be harvested
from a person's body

218
00:11:22,932 --> 00:11:24,850
and easily placed into another.

219
00:11:25,518 --> 00:11:28,353
Wait. You mean we aren't gonna sue
and get a bunch of money?

220
00:11:29,397 --> 00:11:30,772
We've all got enough money!

221
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:34,318
Who needs more money?
We need to get Muhammad's goo!

222
00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:37,905
Excuse us.

223
00:11:42,618 --> 00:11:44,579
What do you think you're doing?

224
00:11:44,704 --> 00:11:47,289
What am I doing?
Just having some fun.

225
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:49,875
Cut the crap.
I thought we were here for money!

226
00:11:50,043 --> 00:11:52,711
Just keep your mouth shut
and do what I tell you.

227
00:11:52,879 --> 00:11:55,047
If we're staying,
I want to know what's going on.

228
00:11:55,172 --> 00:11:57,258
Don't forget
I know who you really are.

229
00:11:58,968 --> 00:12:00,135
Mitch Conner.

230
00:12:00,845 --> 00:12:03,513
If you know what's good for you,
you'll keep your mouth shut.

231
00:12:03,681 --> 00:12:05,683
You're a no good swindler
and a two-bit thief.

232
00:12:05,808 --> 00:12:07,351
We were here for money, not goo!

233
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:08,561
Think about it.

234
00:12:08,686 --> 00:12:11,230
Muhammad is the only person
that can't get ripped on.

235
00:12:11,355 --> 00:12:13,190
Those celebrities want his goo.

236
00:12:14,442 --> 00:12:15,317
So what?

237
00:12:15,485 --> 00:12:17,445
You know what it's worth
on the open market?

238
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:20,531
I got people in Hong Kong
would give me 50 mil for that goo.

239
00:12:21,824 --> 00:12:25,369
So we let them take it from Muhammad,
then we steal it for ourselves.

240
00:12:25,494 --> 00:12:26,871
You catch on quick.

241
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:30,332
Someone's coming.
Get my wig back on!

242
00:12:30,624 --> 00:12:32,000
I was seeing if you need...

243
00:12:34,044 --> 00:12:36,296
You found my fudge packing uniform.

244
00:12:37,381 --> 00:12:39,675
Your secret is safe with me.

245
00:12:41,802 --> 00:12:44,096
We are so sorry for doubting you.

246
00:12:44,221 --> 00:12:46,057
You really did bring us Muhammad.

247
00:12:46,182 --> 00:12:48,559
Thank you so much for coming.

248
00:12:52,646 --> 00:12:53,772
You're welcome.

249
00:12:54,607 --> 00:12:56,817
- Is that okay?
- I don't know.

250
00:12:57,569 --> 00:12:59,445
We need to figure out
how to get Muhammad

251
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:01,656
from the truck
into Tom Cruise's limo.

252
00:13:01,781 --> 00:13:04,574
What?
We promised he'd stay in the truck.

253
00:13:04,742 --> 00:13:07,036
Cruise's lawyers were very specific.

254
00:13:07,161 --> 00:13:10,080
He's sending a limo for Muhammad
to meet him outside of town.

255
00:13:10,331 --> 00:13:12,082
But Muhammad can't be seen!

256
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:15,335
- We'll put a sheet over him.
- You can't even show his feet.

257
00:13:15,669 --> 00:13:18,798
How about a Halloween costume
with one of those plastic masks?

258
00:13:18,923 --> 00:13:20,590
You could still see his eyes.

259
00:13:21,342 --> 00:13:23,928
How about like a big mascot outfit.

260
00:13:24,261 --> 00:13:27,431
One that covered him completely,
not even showing his eyes.

261
00:13:28,307 --> 00:13:29,683
Would that be okay?

262
00:13:35,397 --> 00:13:37,358
We've just received word
from the lawyers.

263
00:13:37,483 --> 00:13:40,236
South Park is saying
they have Muhammad for us!

264
00:13:41,195 --> 00:13:44,115
- Will the machine be ready?
- It'll be ready!

265
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,282
More tacos!

266
00:13:45,450 --> 00:13:46,450
I want more!

267
00:13:47,576 --> 00:13:48,994
No more tacos!

268
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:52,289
- More tacos.
- You just had seven tacos!

269
00:13:52,623 --> 00:13:54,917
- I want more tacos!
- I'm sorry.

270
00:13:55,501 --> 00:13:57,878
- Why are you doing this?
- I am Jennifer Lopez.

271
00:13:58,003 --> 00:13:59,463
I need tacos to live!

272
00:13:59,588 --> 00:14:02,799
You're not really Jennifer Lopez.
Now, stop pissing me off!

273
00:14:03,551 --> 00:14:05,677
I can go.
What do you want, three tacos?

274
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:07,930
Thank you, Charlie Sheen!

275
00:14:08,055 --> 00:14:09,849
And maybe an Enchirito too?

276
00:14:10,182 --> 00:14:12,101
They don't even make
Enchiritos anymore!

277
00:14:12,226 --> 00:14:14,562
- Yes, they do!
- I tried getting one last week.

278
00:14:14,687 --> 00:14:17,481
Not all Tacos Bells have Enchiritos,
but some still carry them.

279
00:14:17,649 --> 00:14:19,483
Will somebody shut her up?

280
00:14:21,443 --> 00:14:24,905
The limo's here.
Thanks again for doing this.

281
00:14:26,657 --> 00:14:29,201
You've done this town a huge favor.

282
00:14:29,493 --> 00:14:30,702
Hold on a second!

283
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:33,247
Stop!
There are some extremists

284
00:14:33,372 --> 00:14:37,042
threatening that if we give Muhammad
to the celebrities, they'll bomb us!

285
00:14:37,167 --> 00:14:38,168
What?

286
00:14:38,878 --> 00:14:40,087
It's a stupid threat.

287
00:14:40,212 --> 00:14:42,172
We don't wanna
piss of Tom Cruise again.

288
00:14:44,383 --> 00:14:45,926
All right, we got him!

289
00:14:53,976 --> 00:14:55,060
Are you okay?

290
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:56,561
What was that?

291
00:14:56,729 --> 00:14:58,772
Obviously,
the terrorists are for real!

292
00:14:59,064 --> 00:15:00,691
What does that paper say?

293
00:15:01,234 --> 00:15:03,611
"We have placed bombs
all over your city.

294
00:15:03,861 --> 00:15:05,654
"You will give Muhammad to us.

295
00:15:05,822 --> 00:15:09,116
"Celebrities want Muhammad
for his power to not be ridiculed.

296
00:15:09,241 --> 00:15:10,743
"We want that power.

297
00:15:11,327 --> 00:15:12,244
"Hazaa."

298
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:15,456
- They want his power?
- What kind of extremists are these?

299
00:15:16,624 --> 00:15:18,042
You won't believe it.

300
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:20,210
Our time is near!

301
00:15:20,378 --> 00:15:23,171
Soon gingers
will never be made fun of again!

302
00:15:23,964 --> 00:15:24,965
Hazaa!

303
00:15:26,675 --> 00:15:30,012
- Where do you think you're going?
- I'm through with your stupid plans.

304
00:15:30,137 --> 00:15:32,097
I've got better things to do!

305
00:15:33,098 --> 00:15:34,934
You're gonna walk away from 50 mil?

306
00:15:36,268 --> 00:15:37,478
Let me by.

307
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:40,438
You walk away now
and you'll regret it forever.

308
00:15:41,649 --> 00:15:43,859
Screw this.
Find yourself another partner.

309
00:15:43,984 --> 00:15:46,362
Then I guess I won't tell you
about your father.

310
00:15:48,697 --> 00:15:49,698
My father?

311
00:15:50,199 --> 00:15:52,076
Thought that might get
your attention.

312
00:15:52,201 --> 00:15:54,203
You know nothing
about your dad, right?

313
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:57,164
I know enough.
My mother is a hermaphrodite.

314
00:15:57,289 --> 00:15:59,041
So she is actually my father.

315
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:01,544
You really still believe
that garbage?

316
00:16:01,669 --> 00:16:03,963
The people in your town
sold you that line!

317
00:16:04,338 --> 00:16:06,548
Come on, you've had
to have doubted it all along.

318
00:16:07,675 --> 00:16:10,177
How would you know anything
about who my family is?

319
00:16:10,887 --> 00:16:13,806
I know all about the swindles
and schemes in this dead end town.

320
00:16:14,556 --> 00:16:17,393
You got lied to,
by the people who were closest to you.

321
00:16:17,518 --> 00:16:20,437
I can prove it too,
but I'll want something in return.

322
00:16:22,189 --> 00:16:24,066
If you made this up
to keep me around...

323
00:16:24,191 --> 00:16:25,525
Take me where I tell you.

324
00:16:26,527 --> 00:16:29,029
When you learn the truth,
you'll learn to trust me.

325
00:16:29,321 --> 00:16:30,406
Nobody else.

326
00:16:35,744 --> 00:16:38,789
People, try to evacuate
in an orderly fashion.

327
00:16:40,041 --> 00:16:43,043
We do not have the resources
to deal with this situation.

328
00:16:43,168 --> 00:16:44,920
A full evacuation is impossible.

329
00:16:45,045 --> 00:16:47,005
Jesus Christ,
what are we supposed to do?

330
00:16:47,173 --> 00:16:48,965
We have to give in to the demands!

331
00:16:49,508 --> 00:16:50,717
I'm sorry,

332
00:16:50,885 --> 00:16:53,220
but we'll have
to give you over to the gingers.

333
00:16:53,345 --> 00:16:56,556
- We can't hand him over to them!
- We said we'd take care of him!

334
00:16:56,724 --> 00:16:58,391
Our homes and lives are at stake!

335
00:16:58,726 --> 00:17:00,685
We made a promise, to Jesus.

336
00:17:01,228 --> 00:17:03,772
Jesus doesn't matter
where Muhammad is involved.

337
00:17:06,442 --> 00:17:08,068
That'll be Tom Cruise.

338
00:17:14,742 --> 00:17:16,034
So what's going on?

339
00:17:17,244 --> 00:17:18,537
I'm afraid we...

340
00:17:19,163 --> 00:17:20,705
can't give Muhammad to you.

341
00:17:20,873 --> 00:17:23,166
What do you mean,
you're not giving him to us?

342
00:17:23,334 --> 00:17:25,127
There are these gingers saying

343
00:17:25,252 --> 00:17:27,545
if we don't give him to them
they'll bomb us.

344
00:17:27,713 --> 00:17:30,173
- Gingers?
- Hell no!

345
00:17:30,341 --> 00:17:33,176
Please understand
that we have no choice.

346
00:17:33,344 --> 00:17:36,180
You're gonna give Muhammad
to gingers instead of us

347
00:17:36,305 --> 00:17:38,807
just because
they are threatening you with violence?

348
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:42,770
We can play that game too!

349
00:17:42,895 --> 00:17:45,105
You wanna see violence, you got it!

350
00:17:45,981 --> 00:17:47,691
God damn stupid assholes!

351
00:17:47,816 --> 00:17:49,610
They wanna play rough?
Okay!

352
00:17:50,152 --> 00:17:52,529
Go and get some automatic rifles.
We'll go in there.

353
00:17:52,697 --> 00:17:55,365
We'll take Muhammad by force.
We're gonna show 'em!

354
00:17:57,076 --> 00:17:59,077
We can't be seen getting violent.

355
00:17:59,453 --> 00:18:00,954
That would kill our careers!

356
00:18:01,122 --> 00:18:02,623
The only way we'll get him

357
00:18:02,748 --> 00:18:05,375
is by getting just as violent
with South Park as the gingers!

358
00:18:05,543 --> 00:18:07,628
Fine.
Then let's have her do it.

359
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:08,795
Her, who?

360
00:18:09,171 --> 00:18:11,256
You know, her.

361
00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:15,385
Right, her!

362
00:18:27,439 --> 00:18:28,607
There she is.

363
00:18:29,691 --> 00:18:31,068
Barbara Streisand.

364
00:18:39,535 --> 00:18:42,120
My God! She's even more terrifying
than I remembered.

365
00:18:42,621 --> 00:18:45,207
Barbara Streisand hasn't been active
for a long time.

366
00:18:45,499 --> 00:18:47,083
Are we sure we wanna do this?

367
00:18:47,251 --> 00:18:50,129
Mrs. Streisand was blown apart
in the town of South Park.

368
00:18:50,254 --> 00:18:52,881
She's probably more angry
at that town than any of us.

369
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:54,258
Power her up.

370
00:18:54,383 --> 00:18:55,926
Release the kraken!

371
00:19:28,667 --> 00:19:30,210
It's me, Rob Reiner.

372
00:19:36,425 --> 00:19:40,345
Listen, we're taking on South Park
and we really need your help.

373
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:43,974
We figured you're pissed off
at South Park too, right?

374
00:19:51,356 --> 00:19:52,900
She's pissed all right.

375
00:19:57,404 --> 00:19:59,030
What are you doing here?

376
00:19:59,823 --> 00:20:01,366
Did you all lie to me?

377
00:20:01,742 --> 00:20:03,368
All of you, in that room?

378
00:20:03,785 --> 00:20:05,871
When you told me
my mother was my father?

379
00:20:06,539 --> 00:20:07,539
What?

380
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:10,208
Are you still worried
about that ol' issue...

381
00:20:10,376 --> 00:20:13,086
I don't trust you.
I want to talk to Mr. Hat.

382
00:20:14,546 --> 00:20:16,881
I haven't used Mr. Hat
in a long time...

383
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:19,092
I said get Mr. Hat!

384
00:20:23,305 --> 00:20:24,306
Put it on.

385
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:29,436
Do the voice.

386
00:20:30,562 --> 00:20:32,606
Hello, kids!
It's me, Mr. Hat.

387
00:20:34,358 --> 00:20:36,568
Good to see you.
Hell of a night, isn't it?

388
00:20:38,111 --> 00:20:39,863
I don't believe I know you.

389
00:20:40,031 --> 00:20:41,198
Mitch Conner.

390
00:20:41,323 --> 00:20:43,408
Flew the same division as you
back in Saigon.

391
00:20:43,909 --> 00:20:45,577
This is silly.
Why don't we stop...

392
00:20:45,745 --> 00:20:47,329
Keep your hand up.

393
00:20:50,082 --> 00:20:51,542
All right, gingers.

394
00:20:51,667 --> 00:20:53,335
We have Muhammad for you.

395
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:55,420
Now hand over the detonators.

396
00:20:57,381 --> 00:20:59,800
First, you gotta prove
that's still Muhammad in there.

397
00:20:59,925 --> 00:21:02,093
Have him step
out of the bear costume.

398
00:21:04,721 --> 00:21:05,972
We can't do that.

399
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:09,184
Show us it's Muhammad
or South Park is finished!

400
00:21:10,144 --> 00:21:13,313
Dammit, Mitch, you're asking questions
that shouldn't be answered.

401
00:21:13,481 --> 00:21:15,857
So you admit it.
There was a cover up.

402
00:21:16,942 --> 00:21:18,360
Don't say anymore!

403
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:21,196
- Tell him what you know!
- All right.

404
00:21:21,738 --> 00:21:24,908
Your father was in the room
the day of your DNA test.

405
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:27,869
But the results were tampered with.

406
00:21:28,203 --> 00:21:29,203
By who?

407
00:21:29,579 --> 00:21:32,791
God dammit.
Who is my father?

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
