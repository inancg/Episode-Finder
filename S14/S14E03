00:00:33,074 --> 00:00:34,784
21, 22,

3
00:00:34,909 --> 00:00:37,161
23, 24, 25...

4
00:00:39,497 --> 00:00:42,042
I wish I could exercise
with the rest of the team, coach.

5
00:00:42,167 --> 00:00:44,044
But I've got such a belly ache.

6
00:00:44,169 --> 00:00:47,797
You seem to have a stomach ache
every time we do drills and exercises.

7
00:00:47,922 --> 00:00:49,299
I know, it sucks!

8
00:00:51,134 --> 00:00:53,303
All right.
Practice is over for today.

9
00:00:53,428 --> 00:00:54,429
KFC!

10
00:00:56,890 --> 00:00:57,724
Oh boy!

11
00:00:57,849 --> 00:00:59,809
I'll get a three-piece meal
and crispy strips!

12
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:02,228
You only come
to soccer practice on Fridays,

13
00:01:02,353 --> 00:01:05,023
only because we get to have
Kentucky Fried Chicken afterwards!

14
00:01:05,148 --> 00:01:07,483
Shut up, you shifty Jew!
I'll fucking kill you!

15
00:01:07,942 --> 00:01:09,027
Sorry.

16
00:01:09,152 --> 00:01:11,363
When I wait too long
for the Colonel's chicken,

17
00:01:11,488 --> 00:01:12,864
I get easily agitated.

18
00:01:13,239 --> 00:01:14,908
You're a fucking asshole, Kenny!

19
00:01:15,742 --> 00:01:16,743
Sorry.

20
00:01:17,035 --> 00:01:18,036
Here we are!

21
00:01:20,663 --> 00:01:21,664
It's different.

22
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:27,253
What's up with the KFC?

23
00:01:27,587 --> 00:01:31,549
It's not a KFC anymore.
It's a medicinal marijuana dispensary.

24
00:01:31,883 --> 00:01:32,967
A what?

25
00:01:33,259 --> 00:01:36,554
- Dude, what the fuck?
- So where's the KFC now?

26
00:01:36,888 --> 00:01:39,224
All right, wait out here.
Let me see what's going on.

27
00:01:44,562 --> 00:01:45,814
Can I help you?

28
00:01:46,272 --> 00:01:48,525
We were actually looking
to get some KFC.

29
00:01:48,942 --> 00:01:51,653
Sorry, that's gone.
We only sell marijuana here.

30
00:01:52,445 --> 00:01:56,157
Really?
You're openly selling pot for reals?

31
00:01:56,449 --> 00:01:58,701
Sure.
New state laws say it's okay.

32
00:02:01,329 --> 00:02:02,455
All right!

33
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:04,082
I love the future!

34
00:02:04,457 --> 00:02:08,169
Let's see, I'll take half a pound
of that Jamaican Passion

35
00:02:08,586 --> 00:02:10,505
and gimme
some of that purplish stuff too.

36
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:13,591
All right, I'll just need
your physician's reference.

37
00:02:14,759 --> 00:02:15,760
My huh?

38
00:02:15,969 --> 00:02:18,679
Sir, we can't just sell
the marijuana to anybody.

39
00:02:18,888 --> 00:02:21,390
You need a reference from your doctor
to show it's necessary.

40
00:02:22,433 --> 00:02:23,434
That's dumb.

41
00:02:24,519 --> 00:02:25,728
I'll be right back.

42
00:02:27,063 --> 00:02:29,441
- What'd they say?
- KFC's gone. Been replaced.

43
00:02:29,566 --> 00:02:32,067
That can't do that!
This is the only KFC in South Park!

44
00:02:32,735 --> 00:02:35,238
- I gotta get to the doctor.
- But we wanna eat.

45
00:02:35,363 --> 00:02:36,405
The doctor!

46
00:02:40,994 --> 00:02:42,287
So no KFC?

47
00:02:43,121 --> 00:02:44,372
This is a nightmare.

48
00:02:44,789 --> 00:02:47,125
This is a nightmare
and I can't wake up!

49
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:52,922
Mr. Marsh, it looks like
you are in perfect health.

50
00:02:53,047 --> 00:02:55,884
Your blood work came back great,
and all your vitals appear normal.

51
00:02:56,009 --> 00:02:57,010
All right!

52
00:02:57,594 --> 00:02:58,928
You check out fine.

53
00:02:59,053 --> 00:03:01,681
That's great.
So can I get a referral from you?

54
00:03:01,806 --> 00:03:04,267
- For what?
- Medicinal marijuana.

55
00:03:05,226 --> 00:03:07,020
There's a shop
that opened in the old KFC

56
00:03:07,145 --> 00:03:09,522
and they said
I need a doctor's referral to buy weed.

57
00:03:10,106 --> 00:03:13,401
Mr. Marsh, you don't qualify
for medicinal marijuana.

58
00:03:13,526 --> 00:03:14,902
But you said I'm healthy!

59
00:03:15,153 --> 00:03:18,323
Medicinal marijuana
is for people who aren't healthy!

60
00:03:18,448 --> 00:03:20,408
AIDS patients, cancer patients.

61
00:03:20,533 --> 00:03:22,410
You know?
People going through chemo.

62
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:24,954
The THC helps them eat
and take the pain.

63
00:03:25,246 --> 00:03:26,998
You are in fine shape!

64
00:03:29,042 --> 00:03:30,168
That sucks.

65
00:03:34,589 --> 00:03:37,467
So, Doctor,
how do most people get cancer?

66
00:03:38,259 --> 00:03:40,220
There's a lot of ways
you can get cancer.

67
00:03:40,345 --> 00:03:42,055
Yeah, but what's the quickest way?

68
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:43,598
- The what?
- Like...

69
00:03:43,723 --> 00:03:45,391
what forms of cancer induce in time

70
00:03:45,516 --> 00:03:47,935
for the Ziggy Marley concert
next Saturday in Denver?

71
00:03:55,818 --> 00:03:57,320
Mom, drive faster.

72
00:03:57,445 --> 00:04:00,240
The KFC in Salida
is a long way away, sweetie.

73
00:04:00,365 --> 00:04:02,951
- Be patient.
- Shut up and drive faster!

74
00:04:03,451 --> 00:04:05,286
I've been waiting
for chicken too long!

75
00:04:05,411 --> 00:04:06,788
We're almost to Frisco.

76
00:04:06,913 --> 00:04:09,165
Why don't we go
to the Church's fried chicken there?

77
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:12,460
What?
Church's chicken tastes like cat shit!

78
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:15,421
- All right, let's take it easy.
- Fuck you!

79
00:04:18,758 --> 00:04:19,717
What's going on?

80
00:04:21,636 --> 00:04:22,637
Move aside!

81
00:04:24,681 --> 00:04:26,683
It's closed.
There's nothing in there.

82
00:04:27,058 --> 00:04:29,560
You can't do this.
The KFC in my town is closed too!

83
00:04:30,603 --> 00:04:32,355
That's because
of the vote last November

84
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:34,857
to ban fast food
in low-income areas.

85
00:04:35,149 --> 00:04:37,318
I have to drive all the way
to Denver to get chicken?

86
00:04:37,819 --> 00:04:38,819
You don't get it.

87
00:04:39,237 --> 00:04:41,865
KFCs were only in low-income areas.

88
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:43,908
In the entire state of Colorado,

89
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:47,036
Kentucky Fried Chicken is illegal.

90
00:04:57,839 --> 00:05:00,884
Dad, Mom says to stop
trying to give yourself cancer.

91
00:05:01,009 --> 00:05:04,595
Just gonna get a little bit of cancer.
Tell Mom it's okay.

92
00:05:08,934 --> 00:05:10,768


93
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:14,063
Can I help you?

94
00:05:14,188 --> 00:05:16,691
I need...
Somebody said you could help me...

95
00:05:16,899 --> 00:05:19,360
I haven't had KFC in almost a week.

96
00:05:20,946 --> 00:05:23,489
- Sign your name, put down the time.
- Really?

97
00:05:23,614 --> 00:05:25,575
Your birth year,
we'll get you through 24 hours.

98
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:26,700
Are you serious?

99
00:05:29,746 --> 00:05:31,331
My God!
That's KFC gravy!

100
00:05:31,456 --> 00:05:32,540
You have KFC!

101
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:41,841
This is it?

102
00:05:42,383 --> 00:05:44,218
One lousy little cup of gravy?

103
00:05:44,386 --> 00:05:46,971
This is a clinic to help you
get over your addiction.

104
00:05:47,263 --> 00:05:48,765
Who wants just gravy?

105
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:51,767
It goes on mashed potatoes!
On extra crispy chicken skin!

106
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:53,686
If you don't want it, that's fine.

107
00:05:55,396 --> 00:05:56,564
God, It's so good.

108
00:06:01,402 --> 00:06:04,530
"Frozen and processed foods
appear to have a direct link

109
00:06:04,655 --> 00:06:07,075
"to many forms
of stomach and colon cancers."

110
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,201
All right.

111
00:06:12,497 --> 00:06:15,625
"Tests show that preservatives
in these foods are the leading cause.

112
00:06:16,042 --> 00:06:18,544
"However, luckily,
most of these cancers are...

113

"slow growing

114
00:06:21,339 --> 00:06:22,340
Dammit.

115
00:06:23,174 --> 00:06:24,675
"Testicular cancer.

"Most common in older men,
and can be extremely aggressive."

117
00:06:28,096 --> 00:06:29,055
This is good.

118
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:32,308
"There is no data on what causes
testicular cancer to grow so rapidly.

of testicular cancer are linked

"to exposure

121
00:06:53,871 --> 00:06:55,331
Could you grab me a beer?

122
00:07:20,106 --> 00:07:21,107
What?

123
00:07:26,071 --> 00:07:28,031
I'm afraid
the tests came back positive.

124
00:07:28,156 --> 00:07:30,366
You do have testicular cancer.

125
00:07:33,077 --> 00:07:34,453
Score!

126
00:07:34,621 --> 00:07:36,622
The good news is
it hasn't spread anywhere.

127
00:07:36,747 --> 00:07:38,248
We should schedule to remove...

128
00:07:39,083 --> 00:07:41,418
But for now, can I finally get
my prescription, please?

129
00:07:41,586 --> 00:07:43,087
Your prescription for what?

130
00:07:43,963 --> 00:07:46,048
<i>Buffalo soldier</i>

131
00:07:46,632 --> 00:07:48,968
<i>in the heart of America</i>

132
00:07:49,844 --> 00:07:52,013
<i>Stolen from Africa</i>

133
00:07:52,555 --> 00:07:54,474
<i>brought to America</i>

134
00:07:54,682 --> 00:07:57,059
<i>She was fightin' on arrival</i>

135
00:07:59,103 --> 00:08:02,065
1 ounce of Purple Lurple,
2 ounces of Fishermen's Friend

136
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:04,609
and a half ounce of Alabama Kush!

137
00:08:08,738 --> 00:08:09,906
That is nice.

138
00:08:12,617 --> 00:08:14,744
Jesus!
Your balls!

139
00:08:14,869 --> 00:08:17,580
I know.
Smoking pot right in front of a cop!

140
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:18,998
Pretty sweet, huh?

141
00:08:19,373 --> 00:08:21,083
I mean your actual balls!

142
00:08:22,126 --> 00:08:23,378
Testicular cancer.

143
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:26,380
Here you want some?
Wait, you're healthy!

144
00:08:26,714 --> 00:08:28,132
Bust his ass, officer!

145
00:08:34,597 --> 00:08:35,598
Kid.

146
00:08:35,932 --> 00:08:37,934
They say
you're looking for some KFC.

147
00:08:39,101 --> 00:08:40,102
Who isn't?

148
00:08:40,895 --> 00:08:42,021
We got some...

149
00:08:42,438 --> 00:08:43,898
over at Billy Miller's house.

150
00:08:44,315 --> 00:08:45,858
Billy Miller?
Seriously?

151
00:08:50,321 --> 00:08:52,990
- Eric Cartman, right?
- Tommy said you have some KFC.

152
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:54,367
Sure.

153
00:08:54,867 --> 00:08:55,868
Jessie?

154
00:08:56,744 --> 00:08:59,163
My God, Colonel's popcorn chicken
and honey mustard sauce!

155
00:09:00,915 --> 00:09:01,916
God, yes!

156
00:09:02,583 --> 00:09:04,919
- Where did you get that?
- I have my sources.

157
00:09:05,211 --> 00:09:06,379
That'll be $85.

158
00:09:07,129 --> 00:09:09,298
85 bucks?
I don't have that!

159
00:09:11,717 --> 00:09:12,927
Hold on.

160
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:14,512
You're a big boy.

161
00:09:14,762 --> 00:09:17,848
Maybe you can pay back another way.
Do a little job for me.

162
00:09:18,266 --> 00:09:20,851
I've got some serious KFC
coming in from a dealer.

163
00:09:21,227 --> 00:09:23,896
I need somebody willing to get
a little risky and pick it up.

164
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:25,230
How much KFC?

165
00:09:25,523 --> 00:09:28,317
Two buckets
plus a three-piece meal and four sides.

166
00:09:28,943 --> 00:09:30,360
Holy fuck, dude.

167
00:09:30,528 --> 00:09:33,448
I've got the money to pay for it,
but it's become a risky business.

168
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:34,740
You get it for me,

169
00:09:35,199 --> 00:09:37,159
I'll make sure
you are hooked up for life.

170
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:38,827
Do you wanna do it?

171
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:40,496
Do I wanna do it?

172
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:43,499
Does the pope help pedophiles
get away with their crimes?

173
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:45,751
Excellent.

174
00:09:51,257 --> 00:09:52,883
All right, see ya tomorrow!

175
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:05,438
God, I gotta hurry.
<i>Caprica</i> starts in five minutes!

176
00:10:08,899 --> 00:10:09,900
Jesus!

177
00:10:17,074 --> 00:10:18,242
Could somebody...

178
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:22,747
I gotta get home.

179
00:10:33,883 --> 00:10:34,925
This can work.

180
00:10:35,176 --> 00:10:36,177
This can...

181
00:10:37,845 --> 00:10:39,263
It's like a hoppity hop!

182
00:10:54,445 --> 00:10:55,446
Are you T-Bag?

183
00:10:55,988 --> 00:10:57,698
Maybe I am.
Who's askin'?

184
00:10:57,823 --> 00:10:59,825
Cut the crap.
You got the stuff?

185
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:02,828
I got the hook-up.
Question is, you got the money?

186
00:11:04,497 --> 00:11:05,873
All right.
We in biz.

187
00:11:09,293 --> 00:11:11,295
- It's all there, man.
- Extra crispy, right?

188
00:11:11,587 --> 00:11:13,088
Course, man.
I ain't no fool.

189
00:11:19,428 --> 00:11:20,846
You trying fuck to me, dude?

190
00:11:21,514 --> 00:11:23,474
This is cut
with Boston Market gravy!

191
00:11:24,475 --> 00:11:26,184
It's all the same shit, man.

192
00:11:26,352 --> 00:11:27,937
It is not the same shit!

193
00:11:29,647 --> 00:11:30,815
I'm sorry, yo!

194
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:34,234
You're cuttin' it with Boston Market
to save yourself some fucking money!

195
00:11:34,402 --> 00:11:35,945
I'll take back the gravy.

196
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:38,155
Like anybody
wants KFC without gravy!

197
00:11:38,489 --> 00:11:41,075
Please, I'm sorry!
Take your money back!

198
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,535
Take the KFC too!

199
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:44,077
What's going on?

200
00:11:45,371 --> 00:11:46,622
Nothin'.
It's cool.

201
00:11:48,165 --> 00:11:49,166
I'll call.

202
00:11:49,667 --> 00:11:50,835
45 to you, Ned.

203
00:11:52,878 --> 00:11:55,756
Man.
This rainy day woman is the bomb.

204
00:11:55,881 --> 00:11:57,717
You guys don't know
what you're missing.

205
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:01,887
You know,
you could share some of that with us.

206
00:12:03,055 --> 00:12:04,140
That's illegal.

207
00:12:04,265 --> 00:12:06,558
I can smoke this,
because I have cancer.

208
00:12:06,976 --> 00:12:08,853
Come on, just give us a little bit!

209
00:12:09,687 --> 00:12:12,023
Get your own
medicinal marijuana cards!

210
00:12:12,148 --> 00:12:14,441
You've all got
perfectly good microwaves at home.

211
00:12:15,401 --> 00:12:17,361
I'm telling you guys it's awesome.

212
00:12:17,486 --> 00:12:20,740
I can have all the pot I want.
I get around faster than walking

213
00:12:20,865 --> 00:12:24,285
and whenever I need a seat,
I can just sit on my balls.

214
00:12:24,827 --> 00:12:26,454
Lemme tell you something else.

215
00:12:26,871 --> 00:12:28,414
Chicks love 'em.

216
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:31,375
Women love huge balls?

217
00:12:31,543 --> 00:12:32,626
Love 'em.

218
00:12:32,918 --> 00:12:34,587
Everywhere I go when I walk by,

219
00:12:34,712 --> 00:12:37,214
chicks are like turning their heads
and going "wha"?

220
00:12:37,548 --> 00:12:40,300
I never knew
how much women loved guys' balls

221
00:12:40,468 --> 00:12:42,136
until I got these puppies.

222
00:12:42,636 --> 00:12:45,306
Travis, did you take out the garba...
Wha?

223
00:12:46,724 --> 00:12:47,975
See?

224
00:12:52,397 --> 00:12:54,106
Cartman, my boy!
You got the stuff?

225
00:12:54,690 --> 00:12:55,775
I got the stuff...

226
00:12:56,066 --> 00:12:57,234
and I got the money.

227
00:12:58,944 --> 00:13:01,488
You're good.
I need people like you.

228
00:13:01,781 --> 00:13:04,241
Good, 'cause I ate a bunch
of chicken on the way over here.

229
00:13:04,784 --> 00:13:07,745
That's all right.
I've got something big in the works.

230
00:13:07,995 --> 00:13:09,288
What if I told you...

231
00:13:09,413 --> 00:13:12,249
that I now how a direct line
to get all the KFC we want here?

232
00:13:12,541 --> 00:13:14,085
I'm sending Tommy to Kentucky

233
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:17,629
to try and set up a little arrangement
with the Colonel himself.

234
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:20,257
Wait a minute.
You mean the Colonel?

235
00:13:20,425 --> 00:13:21,550
That's right.

236
00:13:21,675 --> 00:13:24,136
And I'd like you to go as well
and watch Tommy's back.

237
00:13:24,261 --> 00:13:26,012
Is that something you'd want to do?

238
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:28,265
Is that something I'd want to do?

239
00:13:28,557 --> 00:13:29,809
Is the pope Catholic?

240
00:13:29,934 --> 00:13:31,852
And making the world
safe for pedophiles?

241
00:13:32,978 --> 00:13:33,979
Excellent.

242
00:13:35,981 --> 00:13:38,317
Doctor,
Mr. Kline's test results came in.

243
00:13:40,861 --> 00:13:42,696
What the hell is going on?

244
00:13:43,155 --> 00:13:46,367
- Doctor?
- This is the tenth case this week.

245
00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:48,369
It can't be a coincidence.

246
00:13:48,494 --> 00:13:51,789
Something in this town
is giving men testicular cancer.

247
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:05,761
Man, I am stoned off my ass!

248
00:14:06,178 --> 00:14:07,972
I'm stoned off my balls!

249
00:14:11,725 --> 00:14:14,186
Anybody got more
of that Loompa Loompa weed?

250
00:14:18,649 --> 00:14:20,776
Those guys have nice balls.

251
00:14:20,901 --> 00:14:23,028
Wish my man had balls like those.

252
00:14:33,247 --> 00:14:36,250
Our entire production
is headquartered here, boys.

253
00:14:36,542 --> 00:14:39,295
We move over 16 tons
of chicken every month.

254
00:14:40,045 --> 00:14:43,924
With the new laws in Colorado,
my business has taken quite a hit.

255
00:14:44,425 --> 00:14:46,594
I'm worried other states
might follow suit.

256
00:14:46,719 --> 00:14:49,472
We know, but we can
get your chicken into the state.

257
00:14:49,597 --> 00:14:52,390
We just need a bulk deal.
Say $4.95 a ki?

258
00:14:53,058 --> 00:14:55,769
I've got to hand it to you.
You have everything I man could want.

259
00:14:56,061 --> 00:14:58,772
I like you.
There is no lying in you.

260
00:14:59,023 --> 00:15:01,901
Unfortunately, I don't feel
the same way about your friend.

261
00:15:02,151 --> 00:15:03,109
You mean Tommy?

262
00:15:04,987 --> 00:15:05,988
Where'd he go?

263
00:15:06,113 --> 00:15:08,699
Your partner
is an informant for Jamie Oliver.

264
00:15:20,044 --> 00:15:21,127
That was sweet!

265
00:15:21,879 --> 00:15:23,005
He's all choked!

266
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:25,633
How do I know you're not a liar too?

267
00:15:28,469 --> 00:15:31,055
I've been your biggest supporter
since I was two years old.

268
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:32,931
I love your chicken.
I love you.

269
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:37,311
I think you and me
can work this thing out.

270
00:15:37,895 --> 00:15:40,772
- Do business together a long time.
- Good.

271
00:15:41,065 --> 00:15:42,149
Just remember,

272
00:15:42,441 --> 00:15:44,068
I only tell you one time.

273
00:15:45,069 --> 00:15:46,612
Don't fuck me.

274
00:15:48,530 --> 00:15:50,532
Don't you ever try to fuck me.

275
00:16:00,668 --> 00:16:03,546
Will you look at yourself?
Your balls are getting bigger!

276
00:16:03,671 --> 00:16:05,339
I know, they're pretty swollen.

277
00:16:05,464 --> 00:16:07,549
Kinda hurts,
I'm gonna go buy some more weed.

278
00:16:09,176 --> 00:16:11,344
Please!
When you get back,

279
00:16:12,012 --> 00:16:14,056
do you think
maybe we could make love again?

280
00:16:14,556 --> 00:16:16,517
Someone's feeling frisky again, huh?

281
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:19,770
It's just that I thought
some more alone time could be really...

282
00:16:20,396 --> 00:16:21,772
My eyes are up here.

283
00:16:22,272 --> 00:16:23,315
I'm sorry...

284
00:16:23,483 --> 00:16:25,901
It's okay, I just want you
to look at me when we make love

285
00:16:26,026 --> 00:16:27,528
and not just at my balls.

286
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:29,363
I'll be home soon, babe.

287
00:16:48,507 --> 00:16:51,801
Could you get me half a pound
of that Suburban Sunrise, please?

288
00:16:52,344 --> 00:16:55,347
I'm sorry,
but you have to be inside the store.

289
00:16:58,058 --> 00:17:00,143
I'm right here.
Can you just bring it over?

290
00:17:00,436 --> 00:17:03,105
Selling medicinal marijuana
outside the confines

291
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:05,523
of an approved shop
is still illegal.

292
00:17:23,292 --> 00:17:26,170
I'm starting to feel kind of stupid.
Can I please get high?

293
00:17:28,839 --> 00:17:30,173
What, are you crazy?

294
00:17:30,466 --> 00:17:33,260
Making a deal with the Colonel
for 10,000 more boxes?

295
00:17:33,385 --> 00:17:35,220
I can't move that much chicken!

296
00:17:35,345 --> 00:17:37,097
Will you relax?
It's fine.

297
00:17:38,015 --> 00:17:38,849
Fine?

298
00:17:38,974 --> 00:17:40,976
I'm not making any money here.
I'm losing it!

299
00:17:41,101 --> 00:17:43,561
I have to pay for more security.
I got the cops up my ass!

300
00:17:43,854 --> 00:17:46,648
I have to pay for these sorters
to cut the chicken for distribution!

301
00:17:47,441 --> 00:17:50,527
We've got to be thinking bigger.
It's time to expand!

302
00:17:51,904 --> 00:17:55,324
How can I expand when 36%
of our product is going to you?

303
00:17:56,158 --> 00:17:58,661
Get out there
and sell the chicken, or get lost!

304
00:17:58,786 --> 00:18:01,455
You've forgotten
who the boss of this operation is!

305
00:18:03,248 --> 00:18:05,375
You're not going
to be around a lot longer.

306
00:18:06,043 --> 00:18:07,669
What is that supposed to mean?

307
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:12,215
I told your mom you got an F
on that social studies test.

308
00:18:13,634 --> 00:18:15,009
You wouldn't do that.

309
00:18:15,677 --> 00:18:17,429
Does a bear crap in the woods?

310
00:18:17,554 --> 00:18:20,641
Does the pope crap on the broken lives
and dreams of 200 deaf boys?

311
00:18:22,142 --> 00:18:24,102
Your father and I want
to talk to you!

312
00:18:24,686 --> 00:18:25,937
Bye bye, Billy.

313
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:28,565
Everyone, listen up!
I'm in charge now.

314
00:18:28,816 --> 00:18:30,567
Anybody got a problem with that?

315
00:18:31,151 --> 00:18:32,152
Good.

316
00:18:32,861 --> 00:18:34,780
- What do we want?
- Bigger doors!

317
00:18:34,905 --> 00:18:36,740
- Where do we want em?
- Weed stores!

318
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:38,784
- What do we want?
- Bigger doors!

319
00:18:38,909 --> 00:18:40,785
- Where do we want 'em?
- Weed stores!

320
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,412
Look, I'm sorry,

321
00:18:42,621 --> 00:18:46,124
but the bill says I can't modify
any existing structure!

322
00:18:46,667 --> 00:18:49,878
I guess we could change the law
to allow for medicinal marijuana

323
00:18:50,003 --> 00:18:52,464
to be sold
just outside the door of the shop.

324
00:18:52,589 --> 00:18:54,675
I don't know.
Maybe the rule should be

325
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:57,343
somebody can buy
the medicinal weed for others.

326
00:18:57,636 --> 00:19:01,015
Can't we skip all this
and just make pot legal?

327
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:03,642
Everyone is just abusing
this medicinal system anyway.

328
00:19:03,767 --> 00:19:04,809
It's ridiculous.

329
00:19:05,352 --> 00:19:07,187
What's ridiculous about it?

330
00:19:08,689 --> 00:19:10,357
Hold on people, please!

331
00:19:10,732 --> 00:19:13,569
We are all forgetting
what is really at issue here!

332
00:19:13,819 --> 00:19:16,780
Look around!
These men all have cancer.

333
00:19:17,364 --> 00:19:18,490
It's no coincidence

334
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:21,743
that when this building changed,
the rise in cancer went up.

335
00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:23,037
Don't you see?

336
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:25,663
The KFC was keeping people healthy!

337
00:19:31,086 --> 00:19:32,420
Mr. Cartman, come on.

338
00:19:32,629 --> 00:19:35,632
We have to be handling the business.
You're eating too much of the stuff.

339
00:19:35,757 --> 00:19:38,343
Shut up, Kevin
I'm the boss not you, buttlicker.

340
00:19:39,845 --> 00:19:42,222
The Colonel is on the phone.
He sounds pissed.

341
00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:44,099
What?
That's right. I forgot...

342
00:19:44,224 --> 00:19:45,225
Dammit!

343
00:19:45,559 --> 00:19:46,935
Put him on speaker.

344
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:48,187
<i>Hello?</i>

345
00:19:49,271 --> 00:19:50,438
How're you doing?

346
00:19:50,606 --> 00:19:53,192
- <i>What happened?</i>
- We had some problems.

347
00:19:54,651 --> 00:19:55,777
<i>What happened?</i>

348
00:19:56,445 --> 00:19:57,863
We had a little problem.

349
00:19:57,988 --> 00:19:58,989
<i>I heard.</i>

350
00:20:00,407 --> 00:20:01,574
How'd you hear that?

351
00:20:01,909 --> 00:20:05,204
Because Jamie Oliver
gave his speech at the UN today.

352
00:20:05,621 --> 00:20:08,164
He was not supposed
to give that speech.

353
00:20:08,373 --> 00:20:10,042
It's okay.
We'll get him next time.

354
00:20:10,167 --> 00:20:14,003
<i>There's not going to be a next time,
you fucking dumb cock sucker!</i>

355
00:20:14,421 --> 00:20:15,463
Take it easy.

356
00:20:15,881 --> 00:20:17,841
I told you a long time ago,

357
00:20:17,966 --> 00:20:20,677
you fucking little monkey,
not to fuck me!

358
00:20:21,386 --> 00:20:23,889
Who the fuck do you think
you're talking to?

359
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:25,056
Crap!

360
00:20:32,189 --> 00:20:34,066
- Freeze!
- It's the cops!

361
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:36,568
Run, Billy, run!

362
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:39,321
Mommy!

363
00:20:44,701 --> 00:20:45,827
Last November

364
00:20:46,161 --> 00:20:49,206
this town passed a bill
that seemed silly to some.

365
00:20:49,915 --> 00:20:52,209
Since then we've had
underground black markets,

366
00:20:52,334 --> 00:20:54,378
crime, death and shootings.

367
00:20:54,836 --> 00:20:57,964
But now the bill has been repealed,
and I am relieved

368
00:20:58,132 --> 00:21:00,050
to announce that once again

369
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:02,218
marijuana is illegal!

370
00:21:04,554 --> 00:21:07,015
And an other bill
has been repealed as well.

371
00:21:07,307 --> 00:21:11,269
Cause ever since we got rid of KFC,
we've seen a great rise in cancer.

372
00:21:11,561 --> 00:21:13,855
But today we welcome back KFC,

373
00:21:14,064 --> 00:21:16,316
and all the medical benefits
it gives us!

374
00:21:16,484 --> 00:21:19,527


375
00:21:19,736 --> 00:21:20,904
I got to admit,

376
00:21:21,029 --> 00:21:24,283
it's a lot easier to get in doors
with my little prosthetic balls.

377
00:21:25,033 --> 00:21:25,867
Great.

378
00:21:27,077 --> 00:21:30,038
Don't be upset.
The doctor made you a souvenir.

379
00:21:32,874 --> 00:21:34,042
I love it!

380
00:21:34,167 --> 00:21:36,128
And when it gets cold it shrinks.

381
00:21:37,170 --> 00:21:38,839
You got a scrotum coat?

382
00:21:39,965 --> 00:21:41,049
Lucky.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
