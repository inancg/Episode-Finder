to south park?

3
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:11,928
? Gonna have
myself a time?

4
00:00:11,963 --> 00:00:13,411
? Friendly faces
everywhere?

5
00:00:13,446 --> 00:00:15,181
? Humble folks
without temptation?

6
00:00:15,216 --> 00:00:16,717
? Going down
to south park?

7
00:00:16,752 --> 00:00:18,352
? Gonna leave my
woes behind?

8
00:00:18,387 --> 00:00:19,918
? Ample parking
day or night?

9
00:00:19,953 --> 00:00:21,688
? People spouting
"howdy neighbor"?

10
00:00:21,723 --> 00:00:22,989
? Headed on up
to south park?

11
00:00:23,423 --> 00:00:24,724
? Gonna see if
i can't unwind?

12
00:00:28,628 --> 00:00:30,363
? So come on down
to south park?

13
00:00:30,398 --> 00:00:32,098
? And meet some
friends of mine?

14
00:00:34,601 --> 00:00:36,336
Dude, what's your little
brother doing here?

15
00:00:36,371 --> 00:00:38,071
Ike is starting his
first day of kindergarten.

16
00:00:38,106 --> 00:00:39,372
But isn't he only
three years old?

17
00:00:39,806 --> 00:00:41,072
Yeah, but he's
some kind of genius

18
00:00:41,107 --> 00:00:42,409
So he's getting advanced
placement in kindergarten.

19
00:00:42,842 --> 00:00:44,109
I pooped my pants.

20
00:00:44,144 --> 00:00:45,844
But dude, check out
my newtrapper keeper.

21
00:00:45,879 --> 00:00:48,481
It has five different compartments
for each subject in school

22
00:00:48,516 --> 00:00:50,884
And it's all covered with pictures
from "dawson's creek". Cool!

23
00:00:50,919 --> 00:00:53,253
Hey dudes, check out my sweet
dawson's creek trapper keeper

24
00:00:53,686 --> 00:00:56,254
Ultra-Keeper
futura 2000.

25
00:00:56,289 --> 00:00:58,892
Yeah, well, it's got 10 different
compartments for every subject in school,

26
00:00:59,325 --> 00:01:00,592
Electronic
pencil sharpener,

27
00:01:00,627 --> 00:01:03,012
Four plastic bags with electronic
zippers, copy machine, fax,

28
00:01:03,047 --> 00:01:05,398
A better picture of dawson's
creek on the back than kyle's.

29
00:01:05,832 --> 00:01:07,567
Flat screen tv and
of course,onstar.

30
00:01:07,602 --> 00:01:09,701
Wow, cool.
Godammit, cartman!

31
00:01:09,736 --> 00:01:11,471
You only got that because you
knew my mom wouldn't buy it for me!

32
00:01:11,506 --> 00:01:12,772
Oh, but you have
a trapper keep-

33
00:01:13,206 --> 00:01:14,724
Oh, you got the little
"crapper keeper", didn't you?

34
00:01:14,759 --> 00:01:16,242
Well, at least your stupid
brother got a briefcase.

35
00:01:16,676 --> 00:01:18,411
He's going to kindergarten
because he's a genius.

36
00:01:18,446 --> 00:01:20,146
He's not a genius,
he's a little douche bag.

37
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:21,846
I pooped my pants!

38
00:01:21,881 --> 00:01:23,148
He's smarter
than you, fat boy!

39
00:01:23,183 --> 00:01:24,918
I don't even know how you made it
to the fourth grade after all the-

40
00:01:24,953 --> 00:01:27,087
Trapper keeper, i need to
drown out my annoying friend,

41
00:01:27,122 --> 00:01:29,689
Country, high volume.

42
00:01:33,159 --> 00:01:36,629
Nobody gives a crap about
your trapper keeper, cartman!

43
00:01:42,702 --> 00:01:43,968
Ms. Crabtree!

44
00:01:44,003 --> 00:01:46,172
There's another creepy
homeless guy on the bus.

45
00:01:46,207 --> 00:01:47,708
Sit down
and shut up!

46
00:01:47,743 --> 00:01:49,126
But they smell
like pee!

47
00:01:49,161 --> 00:01:50,475
I am not
a homeless person.

48
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:52,679
I am a new fourth-Grade
student. You are?

49
00:01:52,714 --> 00:01:55,281
Yes, my name is bill,
bill cosby.

50
00:01:55,715 --> 00:01:57,016
Aren't you a little old
to be in grade school?

51
00:01:57,450 --> 00:01:59,185
I was held back
10 hu-Man grades-

52
00:01:59,619 --> 00:02:01,753
Unh- I mean, grades.

53
00:02:01,788 --> 00:02:03,523
Do you companion friends
know eric cartman?

54
00:02:03,957 --> 00:02:05,041
Yeah, that's me.

55
00:02:05,076 --> 00:02:06,091
Eric cartman?

56
00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:09,162
And you have a dawson's creek
trapper keeper futura s-2000?

57
00:02:09,197 --> 00:02:10,897
Yeah, you already
know about it?

58
00:02:10,932 --> 00:02:13,066
Yes, yes, i do.

59
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:16,102
Well, "nobody gives a crap about
your trapper keeper, cartman."

60
00:02:16,536 --> 00:02:18,236
I'm gonna shove that thing
up your ass!

61
00:02:18,271 --> 00:02:20,440
Dude, do you really care if cartman
has something that's better than yours?

62
00:02:20,475 --> 00:02:22,175
No, i don't!
I don't care!

63
00:02:22,210 --> 00:02:24,344
Ooh, kyle.

64
00:02:31,284 --> 00:02:32,984
Hey, there he is.

65
00:02:33,019 --> 00:02:36,272
That's the kid that's supposed
to be some kind of genius.

66
00:02:36,307 --> 00:02:39,526
Yeah, he's only three and
he's already in kindergarten.

67
00:02:39,561 --> 00:02:41,226
Come on.

68
00:02:41,261 --> 00:02:44,297
So, you think you're smarter
than the rest of us?

69
00:02:44,332 --> 00:02:46,466
You think you know more
about the world

70
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:49,068
Just because you're
only three and we're five?

71
00:02:49,502 --> 00:02:51,636
I'm go ba-Ba.

72
00:02:51,671 --> 00:02:53,840
Okay, children,
let's take our seats.

73
00:02:54,274 --> 00:02:56,841
My name is mr. Garrison,

74
00:02:56,876 --> 00:02:59,045
And i'm the new
kindergarten teacher.

75
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:01,448
I used to be the
third-Grade teacher,

76
00:03:01,483 --> 00:03:03,816
But i had a little
"nervous breakdown"

77
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:05,985
And went into the mountains
where i lived off of

78
00:03:06,419 --> 00:03:08,154
"Rat carcasses".

79
00:03:08,588 --> 00:03:12,058
But i'm all better now and school was
nice enough to let me go on teaching...

80
00:03:12,093 --> 00:03:14,661
As long as it was
for kindergarten.

81
00:03:15,094 --> 00:03:16,396
But it's not
a demotion, no.

82
00:03:16,829 --> 00:03:18,998
I mean, just because a teacher
was teaching third grade

83
00:03:19,033 --> 00:03:20,534
And now is teaching
kindergarten-

84
00:03:20,569 --> 00:03:22,386
That's not
a demotion, is it?

85
00:03:22,421 --> 00:03:24,169
No, that's right,
it's not.

86
00:03:24,204 --> 00:03:25,939
Well, let's start with
roll call.

87
00:03:26,372 --> 00:03:28,541
Ah, let's see...
filmore anderson?

88
00:03:28,576 --> 00:03:29,374
Here.

89
00:03:29,409 --> 00:03:30,675
Sally bans?
Here.

90
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:32,879
All right,
ike broflovski?

91
00:03:33,313 --> 00:03:34,579
"Cookie monster."

92
00:03:34,614 --> 00:03:37,650
Broflovski, i had your older
brother kyle in my third-Grade class.

93
00:03:37,685 --> 00:03:40,253
He's a very smart kid,
i'm sure you are too.

94
00:03:40,687 --> 00:03:42,387
Well, that's bad news
for everybody else

95
00:03:42,422 --> 00:03:45,458
Because i will be
grading you all on a curve.

96
00:03:49,796 --> 00:03:52,832
And so the other thing that makes
my trapper keeper cooler than kyle's

97
00:03:52,867 --> 00:03:55,868
Is that it can add any peripheral
device to itself automatically.

98
00:03:55,903 --> 00:03:58,471
I can take something as simple
as this calculator and-

99
00:03:58,506 --> 00:04:00,440
Trapper keeper?
Trapper keeper active.

100
00:04:00,475 --> 00:04:02,375
Hybrid with "wellington bear"
calculator.

101
00:04:02,410 --> 00:04:03,676
Ready for hybrid.

102
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:05,845
And now, i can use
wellington bear calculator too.

103
00:04:06,279 --> 00:04:07,111
Wow.

104
00:04:07,146 --> 00:04:09,098
May i hold your
trapper keeper?

105
00:04:09,133 --> 00:04:11,015
Uh, no, i'm afraid not,
bill cosby,

106
00:04:11,050 --> 00:04:13,219
Because it is coded to
the prints on my fingers.

107
00:04:13,653 --> 00:04:14,919
If anybody but me
tries to hold it

108
00:04:14,954 --> 00:04:17,123
Big metal spikes come out
and pierce through their hands.

109
00:04:17,158 --> 00:04:18,658
Oh, you're so full of
crap, cartman!

110
00:04:18,693 --> 00:04:20,159
Metal spikes
will not come out!

111
00:04:20,593 --> 00:04:23,630
Oh really, then why don't
you hold it?

112
00:04:24,063 --> 00:04:25,365
Well, go on, kyle,

113
00:04:25,798 --> 00:04:28,401
If it doesn't have
metal spikes, then hold it.

114
00:04:28,436 --> 00:04:29,936
Hold it.
I'm gonna!

115
00:04:29,971 --> 00:04:31,402
Hold it.
I will!

116
00:04:31,437 --> 00:04:34,907
And that's how the relationship
with my father sort of ended.

117
00:04:34,942 --> 00:04:37,076
There's still some sort of
skeletons in the closet,

118
00:04:37,111 --> 00:04:39,210
But things between us
are a little better.

119
00:04:39,245 --> 00:04:43,149
Okay, children, well now it's time
for us to elect a class president.

120
00:04:43,184 --> 00:04:45,283
So first
we must pick nominees.

121
00:04:45,318 --> 00:04:47,452
Who would like to
nominate someone?

122
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:51,824
I nominate filmore because he's
the smartest kid in the class.

123
00:04:51,859 --> 00:04:54,861
Okay, filmore, you'll be
our first nominee.

124
00:04:54,896 --> 00:04:56,162
And who else?

125
00:04:56,596 --> 00:04:57,463
Yes, jenny.

126
00:04:57,897 --> 00:04:59,597
I gotta go doody.

127
00:04:59,632 --> 00:05:02,668
In a minute, jenny
- Who else wants to nominate a class president?

128
00:05:02,703 --> 00:05:05,705
Oh, come on, you can't have an
election with just one person running,

129
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:07,405
What's the fun
in that?

130
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:10,043
Ike, how about you,
you're a genius?

131
00:05:10,078 --> 00:05:11,309
No.

132
00:05:11,344 --> 00:05:15,647
Okay, our second nominee
is "ike... the genius".

133
00:05:15,682 --> 00:05:19,152
Okay, children, now we'll hear
briefly from each nominee.

134
00:05:19,187 --> 00:05:21,719
Filmore, why don't you
go first.

135
00:05:21,754 --> 00:05:26,092
If i'm elected class president,
i'll call for bigger chairs.

136
00:05:26,127 --> 00:05:29,996
And on fridays i'll add
two minutes to nap time.

137
00:05:30,031 --> 00:05:31,262
Thank you.

138
00:05:31,297 --> 00:05:32,997
Very enthralling.

139
00:05:33,032 --> 00:05:35,851
Okay, ike,
how about you?

140
00:05:35,886 --> 00:05:38,671
Cookie monster... eyes.

141
00:05:39,105 --> 00:05:41,924
Well, this is gonna be
a tough one, kids.

142
00:05:41,959 --> 00:05:44,653
Oh no, dude, here comes
that weird new kid.

143
00:05:44,688 --> 00:05:47,347
Oh, hello, eric, can i be
your hu-Man friend?

144
00:05:47,382 --> 00:05:49,047
Unh- I mean, friend.

145
00:05:49,082 --> 00:05:51,684
I don't know, dude, i'm not supposed
to have male friends that are over 30.

146
00:05:51,719 --> 00:05:53,384
I kinda got screwed
on that once.

147
00:05:53,419 --> 00:05:56,456
Please, we can have fun and play
games like hu-Man four square.

148
00:05:56,491 --> 00:05:58,589
I mean, four square.

149
00:05:58,624 --> 00:06:01,227
Dude, you can't just ask to be
somebody's friend and be their friend!

150
00:06:01,262 --> 00:06:02,493
It doesn't
work that way.

151
00:06:02,528 --> 00:06:04,697
If you want my friendship
you have to pay me.

152
00:06:05,131 --> 00:06:05,963
Oh, i see.

153
00:06:05,998 --> 00:06:08,601
All right, i'll pay
100 galga stones-

154
00:06:08,636 --> 00:06:11,204
I mean, human dollars,
i mean, dollars.

155
00:06:11,239 --> 00:06:12,470
Okay, that's cool.

156
00:06:12,505 --> 00:06:14,240
Can we play some
hu-Man tether ball?

157
00:06:14,674 --> 00:06:15,940
All right.

158
00:06:15,975 --> 00:06:16,843
Pretty sweet, you guys,

159
00:06:17,276 --> 00:06:18,578
Getting 100 bucks to play
tether ball with some-

160
00:06:18,613 --> 00:06:19,680
Serve!
Ah!

161
00:06:19,715 --> 00:06:20,747
Got it!

162
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:22,915
Dude, he's running off
with your trapper keeper!

163
00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:24,615
Wha-Huh!

164
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:26,351
You son of a bitch!

165
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:27,652
Wait a minute,
lucky for me

166
00:06:27,687 --> 00:06:29,856
I have my trapper keeper
homing device.

167
00:06:29,891 --> 00:06:31,122
What the hell
just happened?

168
00:06:31,157 --> 00:06:34,193
Damn, i thought fourth grade
was gonna be different.

169
00:06:34,627 --> 00:06:39,399
So that's six votes for filmore
and six votes for ike.

170
00:06:39,434 --> 00:06:42,400
And the last vote is for...

171
00:06:42,435 --> 00:06:47,640
Ah, let's see, flora,
i can't tell who you voted for.

172
00:06:48,074 --> 00:06:49,809
You've got the winning vote,
flora, who'd you pick?

173
00:06:50,243 --> 00:06:51,110
I don't know.

174
00:06:51,544 --> 00:06:53,279
Flora, you have to pick one,
filmore or ike.

175
00:06:53,314 --> 00:06:55,899
Um, i vote for...
i don't know.

176
00:06:55,934 --> 00:06:58,449
Oh great,
flora's undecided.

177
00:06:58,484 --> 00:07:00,618
Well, you're just gonna have to
sit there flora

178
00:07:00,653 --> 00:07:02,822
And think about it until
you come up with an answer.

179
00:07:02,857 --> 00:07:03,689
Okay.

180
00:07:04,123 --> 00:07:05,425
Flora, just say
you vote for filmore

181
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:07,160
So we can
all go home.

182
00:07:07,593 --> 00:07:08,860
Um...

183
00:07:08,895 --> 00:07:10,630
No, you want ike
to be president.

184
00:07:10,665 --> 00:07:12,382
We're gonna be here
all night.

185
00:07:12,417 --> 00:07:14,100
Why don't you guys
just concede?

186
00:07:14,534 --> 00:07:15,366
Yeah! Yeah!

187
00:07:15,401 --> 00:07:16,702
Why don't you
just concede?

188
00:07:16,737 --> 00:07:17,969
Yeah!

189
00:07:18,004 --> 00:07:19,270
Filmore!
Filmore! Ike!Ke!

190
00:07:19,305 --> 00:07:20,606
I want filmore to be-
I want ike-

191
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:23,643
Oh, for christ's sakes, you're
all acting like a bunch of kids!

192
00:07:25,812 --> 00:07:27,980
Turn left here, we're getting
close! Get your gun ready.

193
00:07:28,414 --> 00:07:31,017
Eric, i'm not gonna shoot anybody
for taking your school folder.

194
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:32,283
It was not a school folder,

195
00:07:32,318 --> 00:07:34,487
It was a dawson's creek
trapper keeper futura s-2000!

196
00:07:34,921 --> 00:07:36,222
And if- There he is!

197
00:07:36,656 --> 00:07:37,089
Ah!

198
00:07:37,523 --> 00:07:37,957
Gotcha!

199
00:07:38,391 --> 00:07:39,258
Hey!

200
00:07:39,692 --> 00:07:41,427
Aah!

201
00:07:48,367 --> 00:07:50,102
Whoa, dude.

202
00:07:54,874 --> 00:07:57,477
Oh, try to take my
trapper keeper, will you?

203
00:07:57,512 --> 00:07:59,610
Please, you do not
understand.

204
00:07:59,645 --> 00:08:01,814
Book him, barbrady,
another job well done.

205
00:08:01,849 --> 00:08:03,948
That trapper keeper
has to be destroyed.

206
00:08:03,983 --> 00:08:06,152
Why are you so obsessed with
cartman's trapper keeper, bill cosby?

207
00:08:06,187 --> 00:08:07,453
Bill cosby!

208
00:08:07,887 --> 00:08:11,357
No, listen to me!
I am not really bill cosby.

209
00:08:11,392 --> 00:08:14,358
My name is bsm-471.

210
00:08:14,393 --> 00:08:17,864
I am a cyborg engineered by
hu-Mans from the year 2034.

211
00:08:18,297 --> 00:08:19,997
Well, i knew you
weren't bill cosby.

212
00:08:20,032 --> 00:08:21,732
I have come to destroy
that trapper keeper

213
00:08:21,767 --> 00:08:24,153
Because it was the dawson's
creek trapper keeper

214
00:08:24,188 --> 00:08:26,504
That belongs to
an eric cartman in south park

215
00:08:26,539 --> 00:08:30,009
Which three years from now manifests
itself into an omnipotent super being

216
00:08:30,044 --> 00:08:31,744
And destroys
all of hu-Manity.

217
00:08:31,779 --> 00:08:33,913
In the year 2004,

218
00:08:34,347 --> 00:08:38,251
A hybrid assimilating computer linked
with a satellite uplink computer.

219
00:08:38,286 --> 00:08:39,986
From there, it was able to
slowly take over

220
00:08:40,021 --> 00:08:41,738
Every computer in the world.

221
00:08:41,773 --> 00:08:43,421
It became stronger
and stronger

222
00:08:43,456 --> 00:08:46,926
Until, by the year 2018,
it broke away from mankind

223
00:08:46,961 --> 00:08:49,546
And there was nothing
the hu-Mans could do.

224
00:08:49,581 --> 00:08:52,096
It wasn't long before
hybrid trapper keeper

225
00:08:52,131 --> 00:08:55,167
Started to destroy everything
it saw as useless...

226
00:08:55,202 --> 00:08:57,301
Including humans.

227
00:08:57,336 --> 00:08:59,505
The nations tried everything
to stop it-

228
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:01,674
Nuclear devices,
seismic missiles-

229
00:09:01,709 --> 00:09:02,940
But nothing worked.

230
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:06,012
The hu-Mans built robots of
their own, whole armies of them.

231
00:09:06,047 --> 00:09:09,916
But nothing was strong enough
to stop trapper keeper.

232
00:09:11,651 --> 00:09:14,218
And so finally,
the hu-Mans decided to send

233
00:09:14,253 --> 00:09:16,856
One of their robots into the
past to destroy the trapper keeper

234
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:18,591
Before it
even got started.

235
00:09:19,025 --> 00:09:20,326
Wow,
that's amazing.

236
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:23,362
Man, i guess sometimes we let our
technology and stuff grow too fast.

237
00:09:23,397 --> 00:09:25,114
What do you think,
officer barbrady?

238
00:09:25,149 --> 00:09:26,797
Huh- Oh, i'm sorry,
i wasn't listening.

239
00:09:26,832 --> 00:09:31,170
And so eric, now you see why we
must destroy your trapper keeper.

240
00:09:31,604 --> 00:09:35,074
You guys, did i mention
that it has a pencil sharpener

241
00:09:35,109 --> 00:09:36,340
Anda crayon sharpener?

242
00:09:36,375 --> 00:09:38,110
Cartman, it takes over the world
and destroys all of humanity!

243
00:09:38,145 --> 00:09:39,810
What would you guys
have me do, huh?

244
00:09:39,845 --> 00:09:42,014
Walk around with just a plain
old trapper keeper like kyle's,

245
00:09:42,049 --> 00:09:43,766
Is that what you want?
Yes!

246
00:09:43,801 --> 00:09:45,449
Godammit!
Here, take it!

247
00:09:45,484 --> 00:09:46,751
Do you want
my heart as well?

248
00:09:46,786 --> 00:09:49,822
You'll find it on the
bottom of your shoes!

249
00:09:53,726 --> 00:09:55,426
I decided.

250
00:09:55,461 --> 00:09:56,762
Oh, thank god, flora.

251
00:09:57,196 --> 00:09:58,931
All right,
who do you vote for?

252
00:09:58,966 --> 00:10:00,232
Umm, ike.

253
00:10:00,666 --> 00:10:01,534
Yay! Yay!

254
00:10:01,968 --> 00:10:04,570
Okay, so then the total
is six votes for filmore

255
00:10:04,605 --> 00:10:06,322
And now seven votes
for ike.

256
00:10:06,357 --> 00:10:08,040
Ike is the new
class president.

257
00:10:08,075 --> 00:10:10,009
We want a recount.
What?

258
00:10:10,044 --> 00:10:11,909
Recount, recount,
recount...

259
00:10:11,944 --> 00:10:14,113
Oh, of all the juvenile things
i've ever heard-

260
00:10:14,547 --> 00:10:16,716
You lost, filmore,
don't be such a baby!

261
00:10:19,318 --> 00:10:21,487
All right, all right,
i'll count up the ballots again.

262
00:10:21,522 --> 00:10:24,488
Okay, we had
one vote for filmore...

263
00:10:24,523 --> 00:10:29,295
And this time i again get six votes
for filmore and seven votes for ike.

264
00:10:29,330 --> 00:10:31,030
Count 'em again.
Yeah!

265
00:10:31,297 --> 00:10:33,766
No, children,
i've recounted 106 times now

266
00:10:33,801 --> 00:10:36,200
And i keep coming up with
seven to six!

267
00:10:36,235 --> 00:10:38,404
Except in the one instance where
it came out seven to five

268
00:10:38,439 --> 00:10:40,590
And one where it came out
12 to 14.

269
00:10:40,625 --> 00:10:42,742
It's over!
Ike is class president!

270
00:10:43,175 --> 00:10:45,309
Wait, there's still
the absent kid.

271
00:10:45,344 --> 00:10:47,947
Yeah, carlos is absent,
we have to wait for his vote.

272
00:10:47,982 --> 00:10:49,647
Oh, will you grow up?!

273
00:10:49,682 --> 00:10:52,718
Absent kids count, absent
kids count, absent kids...

274
00:10:52,753 --> 00:10:54,852
Jesus, all right,
we'll wait for tomorrow

275
00:10:54,887 --> 00:10:58,791
So the absent kid can cast
his vote, now go home!

276
00:11:01,827 --> 00:11:04,395
Good morning, hu-Mans.
Hey, bill cosby.

277
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:06,599
I have successfully destroyed
eric cartman's trapper keeper.

278
00:11:06,634 --> 00:11:07,865
I broke it apart,

279
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:10,034
Dipped the motherboards in acid,
burnt the memory chips

280
00:11:10,069 --> 00:11:13,105
And sent the wiring to the four
corners of canada. That should do it.

281
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:16,142
So what are you gonna do with your
crappy robot life now, bill cosby?

282
00:11:16,575 --> 00:11:18,310
Well, that is a problem that is
causing me some disconcern-Ment.

283
00:11:18,345 --> 00:11:20,444
I am still here,
but i shouldn't be here.

284
00:11:20,479 --> 00:11:23,082
If trapper keeper has been
stopped, then i should not exist,

285
00:11:23,117 --> 00:11:24,348
But here i am.

286
00:11:24,383 --> 00:11:25,251
Something is still
not right.

287
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:26,517
Hey, dudes.

288
00:11:26,552 --> 00:11:27,853
Cartman, you still got
a trapper keeper!

289
00:11:27,888 --> 00:11:29,553
Yeah, i'm a genius.

290
00:11:29,588 --> 00:11:31,757
Last night i went home and told
my mom that i lost the last one.

291
00:11:32,191 --> 00:11:33,926
Then i cried and i cried,
and finally she felt so bad

292
00:11:33,961 --> 00:11:35,661
That she took me to the store
and bought me a new one.

293
00:11:35,696 --> 00:11:36,962
So everything worked out.

294
00:11:37,396 --> 00:11:38,229
Oh, no!

295
00:11:38,264 --> 00:11:39,999
Cartman, you dumb ass!
You can't get a new one.

296
00:11:40,034 --> 00:11:41,300
Why the hell not?

297
00:11:41,734 --> 00:11:43,000
Because ifyourtrapper keeper
takes over the world,

298
00:11:43,035 --> 00:11:45,638
Then maybe it wasthistrapper
keeper and not the one before.

299
00:11:45,673 --> 00:11:47,807
So then you guys burnt
my last one for no reason.

300
00:11:47,842 --> 00:11:49,108
We will have to destroy
this trapper keeper.

301
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:51,711
But i don't think i can get
my mom to buy me another one.

302
00:11:52,144 --> 00:11:54,747
Don't you get it? You can't
haveany trapper keepers, fat ass!

303
00:11:54,782 --> 00:11:56,013
Oh, that is bull crap!

304
00:11:56,048 --> 00:11:57,748
And you know
what i think?

305
00:11:57,783 --> 00:11:59,483
I think this whole thing
is a setup!

306
00:11:59,518 --> 00:12:01,687
That's right, kyle got this guy
to say he's a robot from the future

307
00:12:01,722 --> 00:12:03,856
Just because he's jealous
of my trapper keeper.

308
00:12:03,891 --> 00:12:05,122
And you know what else?

309
00:12:05,157 --> 00:12:07,326
Screw you guys,
i'm going home.

310
00:12:07,361 --> 00:12:08,194
Cartman!

311
00:12:08,627 --> 00:12:09,929
No- Screw you guys.
Home.

312
00:12:09,964 --> 00:12:10,796
Well, that does it.

313
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:12,063
Hey, what are you doing?

314
00:12:12,098 --> 00:12:13,364
I'm afraid i have
no other choice.

315
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:15,134
For the sake of humanity
i have to kill him.

316
00:12:15,169 --> 00:12:16,435
Oh, okay.
Yeah, that's fine.

317
00:12:16,869 --> 00:12:18,170
No, wait!
What?

318
00:12:18,205 --> 00:12:19,437
Can i do it?

319
00:12:19,472 --> 00:12:20,738
Oh well, i suppose.

320
00:12:20,773 --> 00:12:22,508
Sweet- Kiss your ass
good-Bye, fat boy!

321
00:12:22,942 --> 00:12:24,208
Wait, perhaps
there is another way.

322
00:12:24,243 --> 00:12:25,978
If you could take me to
where eric cartman lives,

323
00:12:26,412 --> 00:12:28,147
I could try reasoning
with his human mother.

324
00:12:28,182 --> 00:12:29,682
Well, yeah, or we could
just kill him.

325
00:12:29,717 --> 00:12:31,183
Yeah, that'd be faster.
He's right there.

326
00:12:31,218 --> 00:12:32,918
I'm afraid i can't.

327
00:12:33,352 --> 00:12:35,955
I think i'm actually starting to feel
what you humans call "compassion".

328
00:12:35,990 --> 00:12:37,256
It is an
amazing feeling.

329
00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:38,522
Ah! Ah!

330
00:12:38,557 --> 00:12:40,257
All right, children,
as you know,

331
00:12:40,292 --> 00:12:43,329
We've been waiting for the
absent kid's ballot to come in.

332
00:12:43,364 --> 00:12:44,630
Well, his mother
was nice enough

333
00:12:45,064 --> 00:12:46,582
To bring him in
from the hospital

334
00:12:46,617 --> 00:12:48,100
So that he could
cast his vote.

335
00:12:48,135 --> 00:12:49,835
Mrs. Harris.

336
00:12:53,305 --> 00:12:55,439
Thank you
very much, billy.

337
00:12:55,474 --> 00:12:56,741
Don't forget to
pick up your lung.

338
00:12:56,776 --> 00:13:01,113
All right, the absent kid's
ballot is for... filmore.

339
00:13:01,148 --> 00:13:02,848
Yay! Yay!

340
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:05,416
Wait one minute!

341
00:13:05,451 --> 00:13:06,752
Oh jesus-
Tap-Dancing-Christ.

342
00:13:07,186 --> 00:13:08,452
I think the ballots
were misleading.

343
00:13:08,487 --> 00:13:10,656
Some kids didn't understand
who they were voting for.

344
00:13:10,691 --> 00:13:12,825
There's a box next to
filmore's name

345
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:14,143
And a box next to ike's.

346
00:13:14,178 --> 00:13:15,453
What's not to
understand?

347
00:13:15,488 --> 00:13:16,694
You're just saying that

348
00:13:16,729 --> 00:13:18,429
'Cause you know
you're gonna lose now.

349
00:13:18,464 --> 00:13:20,633
No, i'm saying that because
you're a booger-Face!

350
00:13:20,668 --> 00:13:22,333
Well, just you wait,

351
00:13:22,368 --> 00:13:24,970
'Cause my famous aunt is
on her way right now.

352
00:13:25,005 --> 00:13:26,670
Who's your famous aunt?

353
00:13:26,705 --> 00:13:28,839
My aunt rosie,
rosie o'donnell.

354
00:13:28,874 --> 00:13:31,477
Your aunt rosie o'donnell
is coming here?

355
00:13:31,512 --> 00:13:33,880
Yeah, she's very active
in politics.

356
00:13:33,915 --> 00:13:36,248
She's gonna set
all of this straight.

357
00:13:36,283 --> 00:13:37,983
Oh, no.

358
00:13:41,887 --> 00:13:43,354
Recharging.

359
00:13:43,389 --> 00:13:45,322
Sweet. You're so cool,
trapper keeper,

360
00:13:45,357 --> 00:13:47,092
I would never let
those assholes take you away.

361
00:13:47,127 --> 00:13:48,793
? I don't wanna wait?

362
00:13:48,828 --> 00:13:50,563
? For my trapper keeper
to be over...?

363
00:13:50,598 --> 00:13:54,900
Trapper keeper
ready to insorb.

364
00:13:55,334 --> 00:13:56,167
Oh, cool.

365
00:13:56,202 --> 00:13:58,804
Trapper keeper merging.

366
00:13:58,839 --> 00:14:00,105
Whoa.

367
00:14:04,443 --> 00:14:05,744
And so you see,
ms. Cart-Man,

368
00:14:06,178 --> 00:14:08,347
You cannot buy your son eric
another trapper keeper.

369
00:14:08,382 --> 00:14:09,648
Not now, not ever!

370
00:14:10,082 --> 00:14:11,817
Right, because it will hybrid
with all those other processors

371
00:14:12,251 --> 00:14:14,854
And generate a whole new era
of technological darkness.

372
00:14:14,889 --> 00:14:16,120
Correct.

373
00:14:16,155 --> 00:14:18,324
Well, i certainly won't
buy him any more then, bill.

374
00:14:18,359 --> 00:14:20,024
Good, now all
that is left to do

375
00:14:20,059 --> 00:14:21,794
Is destroy the trapper keeper
eric has now.

376
00:14:22,228 --> 00:14:23,312
Where is he?

377
00:14:23,347 --> 00:14:24,361
In his room.

378
00:14:24,396 --> 00:14:26,999
But, why don't i show you
the rest of the house first.

379
00:14:27,034 --> 00:14:28,300
Uh-Oh.
Here we go again.

380
00:14:28,734 --> 00:14:30,000
Come this way, billy.

381
00:14:30,035 --> 00:14:31,302
Well come on,
let's go upstairs

382
00:14:31,337 --> 00:14:33,072
And get cartman's
trapper keeper ourselves.

383
00:14:33,107 --> 00:14:34,807
Kyle is just jealous
of you, trapper keeper.

384
00:14:34,842 --> 00:14:36,108
You kick ass!

385
00:14:36,542 --> 00:14:38,277
? I don't wanna wait
for my trapper keeper-?

386
00:14:40,012 --> 00:14:42,615
Open up, cartman, we're
taking your trapper keeper.

387
00:14:42,650 --> 00:14:46,085
? Screw you guys
screw you guys?

388
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:47,351
? Screw you guys-?

389
00:14:47,386 --> 00:14:49,121
Trapper keeper
ready to insorb.

390
00:14:49,156 --> 00:14:50,387
Heh.

391
00:14:50,422 --> 00:14:51,689
Dammit, cartman,
open up!

392
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:54,291
Trapper keeper
ready for hybrid.

393
00:14:54,326 --> 00:14:57,363
Oh sweet, what's it gonna
hybrid with now?

394
00:14:57,796 --> 00:14:59,496
Cartman, you might
as well open up,

395
00:14:59,531 --> 00:15:01,267
We're just gonna have bill cosby
bust the door down

396
00:15:01,302 --> 00:15:03,002
After he finishes having sex
with your mom!

397
00:15:04,303 --> 00:15:05,604
Cartman?

398
00:15:05,639 --> 00:15:06,906
Ahh!

399
00:15:08,207 --> 00:15:10,376
He's not gonna open it,
break it down.

400
00:15:10,411 --> 00:15:11,208
You break it down.

401
00:15:11,243 --> 00:15:12,544
Okay, ready-
1, 2, 3, not it.

402
00:15:12,978 --> 00:15:14,280
Not it.
You lose, kenny.

403
00:15:14,315 --> 00:15:16,015
Oh!

404
00:15:20,786 --> 00:15:22,521
Oh my god-
They killed kenny!

405
00:15:22,556 --> 00:15:23,822
You ba-!

406
00:15:25,557 --> 00:15:27,293
Ahh!

407
00:15:34,667 --> 00:15:36,835
Ooh yeah, ohyeah!

408
00:15:39,438 --> 00:15:42,006
What the hell is that?

409
00:15:42,041 --> 00:15:44,174
Oh my god!
What is that thing?

410
00:15:44,209 --> 00:15:45,945
Children, there's some
huge bulbous monstrosity

411
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:47,697
Heading for the classroom!

412
00:15:47,732 --> 00:15:49,441
Oh my god,
it's awful!

413
00:15:49,476 --> 00:15:51,150
It's coming
for the door!

414
00:15:52,885 --> 00:15:55,452
Hello, kids.
Aunt rosie.

415
00:15:55,487 --> 00:15:57,656
Run for your lives, children,
i'll try to fight it off!

416
00:15:57,691 --> 00:15:59,825
That's my aunt
rosie o'donnell.

417
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:01,091
Oh.

418
00:16:01,126 --> 00:16:03,729
Oh, uh, pleasure to
meet you, ms. Donnell.

419
00:16:03,764 --> 00:16:05,464
You're looking... well.

420
00:16:05,898 --> 00:16:07,633
Don't worry, kids,
everything's gonna be fine.

421
00:16:07,668 --> 00:16:08,899
What's the problem?

422
00:16:08,934 --> 00:16:12,404
Aunt rosie, we think
i won class president.

423
00:16:12,439 --> 00:16:13,671
No, ike won.

424
00:16:13,706 --> 00:16:14,573
Look,
it's very simple-

425
00:16:15,007 --> 00:16:16,273
We took a vote
and the vote tied

426
00:16:16,308 --> 00:16:17,609
So now we've gotta
come up with a way-

427
00:16:18,043 --> 00:16:20,177
Well it obviously isn't
that simple, is it?

428
00:16:20,212 --> 00:16:22,381
I mean, you'd think a little
kindergarten teacher

429
00:16:22,416 --> 00:16:23,647
Could've handled this,

430
00:16:23,682 --> 00:16:26,719
But now we're gonna
do it my way!

431
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:35,793
We are trapper keeper.

432
00:16:35,828 --> 00:16:38,864
Oh no, it's heading for
cheyenne moun-Tain.

433
00:16:38,899 --> 00:16:40,130
Why is that bad?

434
00:16:40,165 --> 00:16:42,334
It was when the
trapper keeper assimilated

435
00:16:42,369 --> 00:16:44,503
With the supercomputer
at cheyenne moun-Tain

436
00:16:44,937 --> 00:16:47,973
That it was able to fuse
into our defensive computers.

437
00:16:48,008 --> 00:16:51,010
Then we have to stop it
before it gets there.

438
00:16:51,045 --> 00:16:53,178
Step on it,
bill cosby!

439
00:16:55,781 --> 00:16:57,516
Hey mark, look.

440
00:16:59,251 --> 00:17:03,155
Wow, that is about the nicest
trapper keeper i've ever seen.

441
00:17:04,456 --> 00:17:05,758
Cartman,
you have to stop.

442
00:17:05,991 --> 00:17:09,626
We are trapper keeper,
we are one.

443
00:17:09,661 --> 00:17:13,565
A part of your friendmust
still be alive in there.

444
00:17:16,602 --> 00:17:17,868
He is in there.

445
00:17:17,903 --> 00:17:20,072
That must be what trapper keeper
is using for ventilation.

446
00:17:20,506 --> 00:17:22,674
If one of you could get in
there, you could reach the c.P.U.

447
00:17:22,709 --> 00:17:23,941
1, 2, 3, not it.

448
00:17:23,976 --> 00:17:25,711
Not it-
Ahh, dammit.

449
00:17:37,423 --> 00:17:39,123
What are you
doing, kyle?

450
00:17:39,158 --> 00:17:41,326
I'm going to try and break you
away from the computer, cartman,

451
00:17:41,361 --> 00:17:43,027
I need to remove
the c.P.U.

452
00:17:43,062 --> 00:17:45,230
I'm afraid i can't
let you do that, kyle.

453
00:17:45,265 --> 00:17:46,549
Screw you, fat ass!

454
00:17:46,584 --> 00:17:47,833
Hey, screw you.

455
00:17:48,267 --> 00:17:50,002
Cartman!
Ah!

456
00:17:50,436 --> 00:17:51,737
No!

457
00:17:54,773 --> 00:17:56,075
Okay, so then what
we need to do,

458
00:17:56,508 --> 00:17:57,810
Is count everybody's vote
by hand.

459
00:17:58,243 --> 00:18:00,846
And after that, we're gonna go over
the votes again manually and then-

460
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:03,847
Oh stop it, stop it,
stop it!

461
00:18:03,882 --> 00:18:07,786
Look, kids, we're all in this
kindergarten class together.

462
00:18:07,821 --> 00:18:09,088
We have to
respect one another

463
00:18:09,521 --> 00:18:12,558
Or else we're in for
a terrible school year.

464
00:18:12,593 --> 00:18:13,824
We're just making sure

465
00:18:13,859 --> 00:18:15,993
That the kids who voted for
my nephew don't get cheated.

466
00:18:16,028 --> 00:18:19,932
Half the kids in the class didn't vote
for your nephew! So what about them?

467
00:18:19,967 --> 00:18:22,552
You don't give a crap about them
because they're not on your side!

468
00:18:22,587 --> 00:18:25,137
People like you preach tolerance
and open-Mindedness all the time,

469
00:18:25,571 --> 00:18:26,403
But when it comes to
middle america

470
00:18:26,438 --> 00:18:28,607
You think we're all evil
and stupid country yokels

471
00:18:28,642 --> 00:18:30,307
Who need your
political enlightenment!

472
00:18:30,342 --> 00:18:33,378
Well, just because you're on tv doesn't
mean you know crap about the government!

473
00:18:33,812 --> 00:18:35,547
Now get your ass
back on first class

474
00:18:35,981 --> 00:18:39,017
And respect this class' right
to make up their own minds!

475
00:18:41,186 --> 00:18:43,355
Oh, sorry, i got a little
off the subject there, kids.

476
00:18:43,390 --> 00:18:45,055
How dare you!

477
00:18:45,090 --> 00:18:47,909
I will not be preached at
by a country bumpkin.

478
00:18:47,944 --> 00:18:50,729
I'm leaving this podunk town,
but in my place

479
00:18:51,163 --> 00:18:53,332
I'm gonna send more lawyers,
statesmen and press

480
00:18:53,765 --> 00:18:55,899
Than you have
ever seen!

481
00:18:55,934 --> 00:18:59,404
Oh, no, children, i think i just
made this a whole lot worse.

482
00:19:09,381 --> 00:19:11,116
Ahh!

483
00:19:11,151 --> 00:19:12,851
Whoa!

484
00:19:16,321 --> 00:19:17,189
Well, that does it.

485
00:19:17,623 --> 00:19:18,924
I'm gonna have to
report this.

486
00:19:19,358 --> 00:19:21,527
Guard one to base-
Ahh!

487
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:23,478
It is infusing
with everything.

488
00:19:23,513 --> 00:19:24,962
It is already
too powerful to stop.

489
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:28,033
Kyle's got to succeed,
he's just got to.

490
00:19:28,467 --> 00:19:31,503
I can't reach
the c.P.U.

491
00:19:31,538 --> 00:19:33,039
What are you doin'?

492
00:19:33,074 --> 00:19:34,505
Get out of my way.

493
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:36,708
Oh no, now there's
two of those things.

494
00:19:37,142 --> 00:19:38,877
No, i think that other thing
is rosie o'donnell.

495
00:19:39,311 --> 00:19:40,577
Huh? Which one?

496
00:19:40,612 --> 00:19:42,998
It's like
i'm seeing double.

497
00:19:43,033 --> 00:19:45,384
I said,
get out of my way!

498
00:19:45,419 --> 00:19:47,119
Aahhh!

499
00:19:52,758 --> 00:19:54,892
Ew.

500
00:19:54,927 --> 00:19:56,662
Look, i think that infusing
with rosie o'donnell

501
00:19:57,095 --> 00:19:59,229
Has made
trapper keeper sick.

502
00:19:59,264 --> 00:20:03,567
Euhhh... bad pie,
bad pie.

503
00:20:03,602 --> 00:20:06,205
This is your chance, kyle,
cartman is weakened.

504
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:09,675
Got him.

505
00:20:14,012 --> 00:20:16,181
He did it!

506
00:20:20,519 --> 00:20:23,520
Okay, children,
the lawyers for ike's side

507
00:20:23,555 --> 00:20:25,724
Have agreed with the lawyer's
on filmore's side

508
00:20:26,158 --> 00:20:29,194
To hold another meeting
regarding form 22-F.

509
00:20:29,229 --> 00:20:30,929
Do we all
have that form?

510
00:20:31,129 --> 00:20:32,231
Is this the
kindergarten classroom?

511
00:20:32,266 --> 00:20:34,798
Jesse jackson?
That's right.

512
00:20:34,833 --> 00:20:36,568
I believe the african-American
students in your class

513
00:20:37,002 --> 00:20:38,268
Were misrepresented.

514
00:20:38,303 --> 00:20:40,906
We don't have any african-
Americans in our class!

515
00:20:40,941 --> 00:20:43,907
Oh- Bye.

516
00:20:43,942 --> 00:20:45,677
All right, so apparently
what we're gonna do now

517
00:20:46,111 --> 00:20:48,280
Is hand count
each person's ballot.

518
00:20:48,315 --> 00:20:51,750
Mr. Garrison,
i concede.

519
00:20:51,785 --> 00:20:54,318
You- You what?

520
00:20:54,353 --> 00:20:56,955
I don't wanna play anymore
'cause this game is stupid.

521
00:20:56,990 --> 00:20:59,141
Yeah, it doesn't
make any sense.

522
00:20:59,176 --> 00:21:01,293
Ike, you could be
class president.

523
00:21:01,328 --> 00:21:03,028
I pooped my pants!

524
00:21:03,462 --> 00:21:04,763
Can we finger paint now?

525
00:21:05,197 --> 00:21:06,932
Finger paint!
Finger paint!

526
00:21:07,366 --> 00:21:11,703
Ah- Yes, yes,
let's finger paint!

527
00:21:11,738 --> 00:21:12,970
You did it, kyle.

528
00:21:13,005 --> 00:21:14,306
Kyle saved your life,
fat ass.

529
00:21:14,341 --> 00:21:16,041
Look, i'm fading!

530
00:21:16,475 --> 00:21:18,644
It must have worked,
i don't exist!

531
00:21:19,077 --> 00:21:20,777
Oh, that's a bitch.

532
00:21:20,812 --> 00:21:23,415
Oh, well, i guess
everything's fine now.

533
00:21:23,450 --> 00:21:24,248
So let's go home.

534
00:21:24,283 --> 00:21:25,983
Hey, whoa, whoa,
whoa, cartman-

535
00:21:26,018 --> 00:21:28,186
All you've been doing is making fun
of kyle and now he saved your life.

536
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:29,921
You at least owe him
a thank you.

537
00:21:29,956 --> 00:21:31,223
Oh, man...

538
00:21:31,657 --> 00:21:32,489
Cartman!

539
00:21:32,524 --> 00:21:34,259
All right, all right.

540
00:21:34,294 --> 00:21:36,428
Kyle...
