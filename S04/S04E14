00:00:11,299 --> 00:00:14,336
Ahh... dickens-

3
00:00:14,770 --> 00:00:16,938
The imagery of
cobblestone streets,

4
00:00:16,973 --> 00:00:18,638
Craggy london buildings

5
00:00:18,673 --> 00:00:22,144
And nutmeg-Filled
yorkshire puddings.

6
00:00:22,179 --> 00:00:24,711
Hello,
i'm a british person.

7
00:00:24,746 --> 00:00:26,481
For years now
the character "pip"

8
00:00:26,516 --> 00:00:28,216
Has been
featured prominently

9
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:30,350
In the american show
"south park".

10
00:00:30,385 --> 00:00:33,855
However, many americans don't
realize where pip came from.

11
00:00:33,890 --> 00:00:36,024
He's the prowling,
adorable little englishman

12
00:00:36,458 --> 00:00:39,494
From charles dickens'
timeless classic

13
00:00:39,529 --> 00:00:41,663
"Great expectations".

14
00:00:42,097 --> 00:00:43,797
And so tonight,
the makers of south park

15
00:00:43,832 --> 00:00:47,267
Have agreed to take a break
from their regular show

16
00:00:47,302 --> 00:00:50,772
And instead present the prestigious
dickens tale in its entirety

17
00:00:50,807 --> 00:00:52,472
From beginning
to end.

18
00:00:52,507 --> 00:00:53,809
Indeed, after
watching this show

19
00:00:54,242 --> 00:00:55,942
You'll know
the timeless classic

20
00:00:55,977 --> 00:00:59,014
As if you'd read
thecliff notesthemselves.

21
00:00:59,049 --> 00:01:01,616
Our story is set
in england,

22
00:01:02,050 --> 00:01:05,087
In the small town of
draffordshire-Upon-Topsmart

23
00:01:05,122 --> 00:01:07,689
Where a young blond-Haired boy
named pip

24
00:01:08,123 --> 00:01:11,159
Was on his way
to see his parents.

25
00:01:17,666 --> 00:01:18,967
Hello, mum.
Hello, dad.

26
00:01:19,401 --> 00:01:21,968
It certainly is nice
to see you again.

27
00:01:22,003 --> 00:01:24,137
Don't worry, sister is still
taking very good care of me.

28
00:01:24,172 --> 00:01:26,775
She just loves to smack me in the
face and tell me i'm worthless.

29
00:01:26,810 --> 00:01:28,944
Oh, we have
such fun together!

30
00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:33,281
Well, it's getting dark,
mum and dad.

31
00:01:33,715 --> 00:01:35,450
I'll see you again soon.

32
00:01:38,487 --> 00:01:39,753
Wha!

33
00:01:39,788 --> 00:01:42,355
What you doing here,
you little wiversham?

34
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:44,559
Oh, hello, why, you look
like an escaped convict.

35
00:01:44,594 --> 00:01:46,728
Did we breakie-Wakies
out of prison?

36
00:01:46,763 --> 00:01:48,897
Oh, dear,
but you're shackled.

37
00:01:48,932 --> 00:01:50,163
Here, let me help you.

38
00:01:50,198 --> 00:01:51,465
What are you
doing with those?

39
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:53,451
I'm an apprentice blacksmith,
there you are.

40
00:01:53,486 --> 00:01:55,403
And here's a sandwich,
you must be starving.

41
00:01:55,438 --> 00:01:58,240
Yeah, why are you
so easy to help me?

42
00:01:58,275 --> 00:02:01,042
Well, it's not for me
to judge you, sir.

43
00:02:01,077 --> 00:02:03,211
We are all the same.

44
00:02:04,946 --> 00:02:07,549
Don't quite all smell the same,
though, i'm afraid.

45
00:02:08,850 --> 00:02:10,152
Pip, where
have you been?!

46
00:02:10,585 --> 00:02:11,418
Wha!

47
00:02:11,453 --> 00:02:12,719
Lovely day, isn't it?

48
00:02:12,754 --> 00:02:14,020
What the hell's
lovely about it?!

49
00:02:14,055 --> 00:02:16,224
Joe, teach this boy
some bloody cynicism!

50
00:02:16,259 --> 00:02:18,358
Oh, i don't know
about that.

51
00:02:18,393 --> 00:02:21,429
I just like to keep
to me blacksmithing.

52
00:02:21,464 --> 00:02:24,266
Hey, look, i made me
a metal fire poker.

53
00:02:24,301 --> 00:02:27,068
A lot of bloody good
a fire poker's gonna do

54
00:02:27,103 --> 00:02:28,768
While i'm starving
to death!

55
00:02:28,803 --> 00:02:31,839
Why don't you make us some
bloody food to eat!

56
00:02:31,874 --> 00:02:34,876
All right, look here,
i made me a metal orange.

57
00:02:34,911 --> 00:02:37,045
Stuff your metal orange,
you bastard!

58
00:02:37,479 --> 00:02:40,081
You're not worth a tablespoon
of nightingale droppings,

59
00:02:40,515 --> 00:02:41,816
You metal-Pounding fairy!

60
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:43,552
And you, why don't you
get a job?!

61
00:02:43,587 --> 00:02:45,252
You're eight years old now!

62
00:02:45,287 --> 00:02:49,624
Oh, lookie here, i've gone
and made a metal newspaper.

63
00:02:49,659 --> 00:02:51,324
Shut up, you silly nit!

64
00:02:51,359 --> 00:02:53,962
What the hell are we supposed
to do with a metal newspaper?!

65
00:02:54,396 --> 00:02:56,998
Well, for starters,
we can look in the want ads

66
00:02:57,033 --> 00:02:59,167
And see if we can
find pip a job.

67
00:02:59,367 --> 00:03:00,867
Oh, look here!

68
00:03:00,902 --> 00:03:03,071
"Young man wanted
for paid position."

69
00:03:03,106 --> 00:03:04,771
Where?
Where?

70
00:03:04,806 --> 00:03:07,842
"Havesham residence seeks young
boy to play with lonely daughter.

71
00:03:08,276 --> 00:03:11,313
Will pay up to...
20 quid a day"!

72
00:03:11,348 --> 00:03:12,579
That's a lot of
money-Woney.

73
00:03:12,614 --> 00:03:16,518
You can keep a little girl
company for 20 quid a day, pip.

74
00:03:16,553 --> 00:03:20,422
And old mrs. Havesham is the
wealthiest woman in the town!

75
00:03:20,457 --> 00:03:22,556
Well, the very next day,

76
00:03:22,591 --> 00:03:25,794
Pip went to old miss havesham's
house to inquire about the job.

77
00:03:25,829 --> 00:03:30,398
And it was there that he met
the girl of his dreams.

78
00:03:30,433 --> 00:03:31,665
Who are you?

79
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:33,833
I've come to
answer the want ad.

80
00:03:33,868 --> 00:03:35,604
Is that so, you smelly
little bastard?

81
00:03:36,037 --> 00:03:36,870
What?!

82
00:03:36,905 --> 00:03:40,375
This way, you pathetic
squirt of vaginal discharge.

83
00:03:41,676 --> 00:03:46,014
This way, you beef-Witted
shriveled-Up monkey's penis.

84
00:03:46,049 --> 00:03:49,918
Up here, you gamey mass
of baby vomit.

85
00:03:51,653 --> 00:03:53,787
In here.
Oh, after you, miss.

86
00:03:53,822 --> 00:03:57,292
I'm not going in there, you stupid
puddle of a homeless man's urine.

87
00:04:00,328 --> 00:04:02,028
Who is that?

88
00:04:02,063 --> 00:04:04,232
I've come to answer
the want ad, ma'am.

89
00:04:04,267 --> 00:04:07,667
Come closer, look at me.

90
00:04:07,702 --> 00:04:09,654
Does it frighten you
to look upon a woman

91
00:04:09,689 --> 00:04:11,606
Who has not seen the sun
in over 20 years?

92
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:13,306
Oh, no, no!

93
00:04:13,341 --> 00:04:15,076
You sort of look upon women
who have not seen the sun

94
00:04:15,111 --> 00:04:17,679
For over 20 years
quite a lot these days.

95
00:04:17,714 --> 00:04:19,379
I sometimes
have sick fancies.

96
00:04:19,414 --> 00:04:22,450
And i have a fancy i shall
like to see someone play,

97
00:04:22,485 --> 00:04:24,185
So play.

98
00:04:24,619 --> 00:04:25,920
Play.

99
00:04:26,354 --> 00:04:27,222
Umm.

100
00:04:29,824 --> 00:04:31,126
Estella,
play with this boy.

101
00:04:31,559 --> 00:04:33,693
Withhim?

102
00:04:33,728 --> 00:04:36,330
But he's
just a commoner!

103
00:04:36,365 --> 00:04:38,950
But, you can
break his heart.

104
00:04:38,985 --> 00:04:41,501
All right, boy,
let us play.

105
00:04:41,536 --> 00:04:43,488
Rightie-O, what are
we going to play?

106
00:04:43,523 --> 00:04:45,405
We are going to play
a little game called

107
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:48,008
"Smack the blond boy in
the head with a large log."

108
00:04:48,043 --> 00:04:50,645
Oh, yes, my sister and i play
that game at home all the time!

109
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:53,480
Who will go first?

110
00:04:53,515 --> 00:04:56,718
Oh, you stupid
pathetic boy!

111
00:04:57,152 --> 00:04:58,852
What do you
think of her?

112
00:04:58,887 --> 00:05:01,690
Well, i... i think
she's very pretty.

113
00:05:01,923 --> 00:05:03,189
Hmm, what else?

114
00:05:03,224 --> 00:05:05,393
I think she's
rather insulting.

115
00:05:05,428 --> 00:05:07,527
You quite fancy her,
don't you?

116
00:05:07,562 --> 00:05:11,431
Come back again next week,
we shall play some more.

117
00:05:11,466 --> 00:05:14,901
That night, pip spent
all his sleeping hours

118
00:05:14,936 --> 00:05:18,406
Unable to get estella's
beautiful face out of his mind.

119
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:22,310
Stop dreaming about me,
you slow-Witted rectal belch.

120
00:05:22,744 --> 00:05:24,913
Day after day,
pip visited estella.

121
00:05:24,948 --> 00:05:26,231
Sometimes, they would play.

122
00:05:26,266 --> 00:05:27,515
Sometimes,
they would talk.

123
00:05:27,949 --> 00:05:31,419
But every single day,
pip's love for estella grew.

124
00:05:33,154 --> 00:05:34,456
Don't you want to
play anymore?

125
00:05:34,889 --> 00:05:36,791
Boy, do you still
think i'm pretty?

126
00:05:37,058 --> 00:05:38,360
Oh, well, yes, miss.

127
00:05:38,793 --> 00:05:40,528
And do you still think
i'm insulting?

128
00:05:40,962 --> 00:05:43,131
Oh, um,
not so much as before.

129
00:05:43,565 --> 00:05:43,998
Ow!

130
00:05:44,432 --> 00:05:45,265
I hate you!

131
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:47,469
You're an oozing, painful
hemorrhoid that belches pus.

132
00:05:47,504 --> 00:05:48,336
Oh dear.

133
00:05:48,770 --> 00:05:50,939
You may kiss me
if you like.

134
00:05:51,373 --> 00:05:53,975
Come, let us walk
in the daisy garden.

135
00:05:54,409 --> 00:05:56,578
Oh, what fun it is to
splash about in a fountain!

136
00:05:56,613 --> 00:05:58,113
You there,
the prowling little boy,

137
00:05:58,148 --> 00:05:59,965
I bet you can't
jump on my back.

138
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,783
Go on then,
try and jump on my back.

139
00:06:01,818 --> 00:06:02,615
Who is that?

140
00:06:02,650 --> 00:06:04,784
Just another playmate,
hired to amuse me.

141
00:06:04,819 --> 00:06:06,554
You didn't think you were
the only one, did you?

142
00:06:06,589 --> 00:06:08,254
Oh, i, rather
thought i was.

143
00:06:08,289 --> 00:06:10,423
Oh, you silly
small-Testicled boy.

144
00:06:10,458 --> 00:06:13,695
Come, let us walk through
the rose garden.

145
00:06:13,730 --> 00:06:15,230
Yes, good,

146
00:06:15,663 --> 00:06:19,134
She will break his pathetic
heart into a million pieces.

147
00:06:24,339 --> 00:06:26,941
Well, what a spot
poor pip was in!

148
00:06:27,375 --> 00:06:28,641
He was hired
to be the friend

149
00:06:28,676 --> 00:06:30,411
Of the very harsh
and beautiful estella.

150
00:06:30,446 --> 00:06:32,112
And although she
treated him like dirt,

151
00:06:32,147 --> 00:06:34,714
Or perhapsbecause
she treated him like dirt,

152
00:06:34,749 --> 00:06:38,219
Pip found himself more in love with
the little girl each and every day.

153
00:06:38,254 --> 00:06:40,822
Oh, bless him,
isn't he lovely?

154
00:06:40,857 --> 00:06:43,390
But, isn't it sad?

155
00:06:43,425 --> 00:06:46,027
Because pip knew that someone as
sophisticated and as wealthy as estella

156
00:06:46,461 --> 00:06:48,161
Could never
love him,

157
00:06:48,196 --> 00:06:51,232
For he was just a simple
blacksmith's apprentice.

158
00:06:52,967 --> 00:06:54,269
And so you
bang on this side.

159
00:06:54,702 --> 00:06:55,969
A bang on that side.

160
00:06:56,004 --> 00:06:59,474
And there you have it,
your very own metal fuzzy dice.

161
00:06:59,509 --> 00:07:00,792
Yes, i see.

162
00:07:00,827 --> 00:07:02,041
Ha ha, lovely.

163
00:07:02,076 --> 00:07:03,777
Ehh, what's
all this, pip?

164
00:07:03,812 --> 00:07:05,980
Joe, do you know
anything about girls?

165
00:07:06,015 --> 00:07:07,247
Sure.

166
00:07:07,282 --> 00:07:10,752
They're those things
with vaginas in 'em.

167
00:07:11,186 --> 00:07:12,921
But, do you know
anything about them,

168
00:07:12,956 --> 00:07:14,187
About how they work?

169
00:07:14,222 --> 00:07:15,523
Oh, i don't know
about that.

170
00:07:15,957 --> 00:07:18,525
I just like to keep to
me blacksmithing.

171
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,295
Do you think that a girl
who's rich and educated

172
00:07:20,330 --> 00:07:22,464
Would ever want to be
with a blacksmith?

173
00:07:22,499 --> 00:07:25,934
Oh... no,
i don't think so, pip.

174
00:07:27,669 --> 00:07:28,970
Who could that be?

175
00:07:29,404 --> 00:07:31,538
Joe the blacksmith?
The same.

176
00:07:31,573 --> 00:07:34,175
I'm a lawyer from london in
search of a young lad named pip.

177
00:07:34,609 --> 00:07:35,442
I'm pip, sir.

178
00:07:35,477 --> 00:07:36,995
Mr. Blacksmith,
i've been sent here

179
00:07:37,030 --> 00:07:38,513
To offer you a
reasonable sum of money

180
00:07:38,548 --> 00:07:40,482
In exchange for
your apprentice.

181
00:07:40,517 --> 00:07:42,382
Oh, well, pip's not
for sale, sir.

182
00:07:42,417 --> 00:07:45,453
I have a client who wishes to
give this bright child a future.

183
00:07:45,488 --> 00:07:47,587
Anything he desires,
do you still object?

184
00:07:47,622 --> 00:07:50,658
Heaven forbid i should stand
in the way of pip's future, but-

185
00:07:50,693 --> 00:07:52,627
He will one day inherit
a handsome property.

186
00:07:52,662 --> 00:07:54,913
But the owner of that
property wants him first

187
00:07:54,948 --> 00:07:57,165
To travel to london and
learn to be a gentleman.

188
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:59,299
That's great news!

189
00:07:59,334 --> 00:08:01,034
There's only one
condition, pip.

190
00:08:01,069 --> 00:08:03,238
Your benefactor wishes
to remain anonymous.

191
00:08:03,273 --> 00:08:05,371
Oh, but it must be
miss havesham.

192
00:08:05,406 --> 00:08:08,009
Uh, uh! If you have any suspicion
of who that person might be,

193
00:08:08,044 --> 00:08:09,744
You're to keep it in your
own breast, understood?

194
00:08:09,779 --> 00:08:11,010
Yes, sir.

195
00:08:11,045 --> 00:08:12,780
Then you will go to london
in a week's time.

196
00:08:12,815 --> 00:08:14,047
Here's 20 sovereigns.

197
00:08:14,082 --> 00:08:15,383
Well, blacksmith,
you look stunned.

198
00:08:15,418 --> 00:08:16,649
I am, sir.

199
00:08:16,684 --> 00:08:17,985
Then i shall
take my leave.

200
00:08:18,020 --> 00:08:19,252
Good evening,
gentlemen,

201
00:08:19,287 --> 00:08:21,022
And we shall see you
in london next week, pip.

202
00:08:21,057 --> 00:08:22,288
Good-Bye, sir.

203
00:08:22,323 --> 00:08:27,529
Pip, a young gentleman...
of great expectations!

204
00:08:35,336 --> 00:08:37,939
You shall stay here with
your roommate, mr. Pocket.

205
00:08:37,974 --> 00:08:39,639
He is a distinguished
young lad

206
00:08:39,674 --> 00:08:41,843
Who will help you on your way
to being a gentleman.

207
00:08:41,878 --> 00:08:43,144
I trust you see
no problem with this?

208
00:08:43,578 --> 00:08:44,410
None, sir.

209
00:08:44,445 --> 00:08:45,712
I should think not.

210
00:08:45,747 --> 00:08:47,916
On up then, and prepare
for school on the morrow.

211
00:08:47,951 --> 00:08:50,084
Yes, sir,
thank you, sir.

212
00:08:55,290 --> 00:08:56,157
Mr. Pip.

213
00:08:56,192 --> 00:08:57,025
Mr. Pocket?

214
00:08:57,458 --> 00:08:58,542
Pray, come in.

215
00:08:58,577 --> 00:08:59,592
Thank you kindly.

216
00:08:59,627 --> 00:09:00,894
You look rather
familiar.

217
00:09:00,929 --> 00:09:02,880
As do you, perhaps we've
seen each other before.

218
00:09:02,915 --> 00:09:04,797
As to our lodging, it's not
by any means splendid.

219
00:09:04,832 --> 00:09:07,001
This is our sitting room, just chairs
and tables and carpets and so forth.

220
00:09:07,036 --> 00:09:08,753
This is my little bedroom,
rather musty.

221
00:09:08,788 --> 00:09:10,471
And this is your bedroom.
My, how lovely.

222
00:09:10,506 --> 00:09:11,738
Oh, what a gay time
we shall have!

223
00:09:11,773 --> 00:09:14,375
And i do mean gay as in festive,
not as in penetration of the bum.

224
00:09:14,410 --> 00:09:15,694
Oh, but dear me,
i beg your pardon!

225
00:09:15,729 --> 00:09:16,978
You're holding your
bags all this time.

226
00:09:17,412 --> 00:09:19,147
Pray, let me take them,
i'm quite ashamed.

227
00:09:19,182 --> 00:09:20,847
Oh, it's quite all right.
Lord bless me!

228
00:09:20,882 --> 00:09:23,051
Why, you're the pale young gentleman
i saw in miss havesham's house.

229
00:09:23,086 --> 00:09:24,786
Why yes, of course, you're
the prowling little boy!

230
00:09:24,821 --> 00:09:26,087
Oh, what a
smashing coincidence.

231
00:09:26,122 --> 00:09:27,353
Perhaps, but perhaps not.

232
00:09:27,388 --> 00:09:29,088
Miss havesham
is very generous indeed.

233
00:09:29,123 --> 00:09:30,858
That old biddy, i assure you, i
have nothing to do with her anymore,

234
00:09:30,893 --> 00:09:32,594
She's absolutely mad.
What do you mean?

235
00:09:33,027 --> 00:09:34,727
Don't you know about miss
havesham's melancholy past?

236
00:09:34,762 --> 00:09:38,232
Dear me, it's quite a story, and
shall be discussed over dinner, come.

237
00:09:38,666 --> 00:09:40,835
Right, time for a smashing meal
and the story of miss havesham.

238
00:09:40,870 --> 00:09:42,268
Pocket, may i ask you
a favor?

239
00:09:42,303 --> 00:09:43,871
I am desperately trying
to become a gentleman

240
00:09:43,906 --> 00:09:45,572
For the love
of a certain girl.

241
00:09:45,607 --> 00:09:47,992
So will you please tell me if i
do something wrong at the table?

242
00:09:48,027 --> 00:09:50,378
You'll do fine, dear fellow, just
fine. Now, on to miss havesham.

243
00:09:50,812 --> 00:09:53,414
She was raised by a wealthy father and
grew up to be somewhat of a spoiled brat.

244
00:09:53,449 --> 00:09:55,114
And now,
i might mention, pip,

245
00:09:55,149 --> 00:09:57,085
That in london it is not the custom
to put the knife in the mouth.

246
00:09:57,318 --> 00:09:59,452
Oh dear, i'm terribly
sorry. Not at all, i'm sure.

247
00:09:59,487 --> 00:10:02,523
Anyway, miss havesham grew up to be a
lovely young lady and soon a man came along.

248
00:10:02,558 --> 00:10:04,059
Which gets me to the
cruel part of the story.

249
00:10:04,094 --> 00:10:05,525
Merely breaking off,
my dear pip, to remark

250
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:07,295
That a dinner napkin should
never be placed into the tumbler.

251
00:10:07,729 --> 00:10:09,862
Sorry, sorry.
Not at all, i'm sure.

252
00:10:09,897 --> 00:10:12,500
So this man pursued miss havesham closely
and professed to be devoted to her.

253
00:10:12,535 --> 00:10:13,766
She passionately
loved him back.

254
00:10:13,801 --> 00:10:15,103
The marriage day was fixed,
the wedding dresses bought,

255
00:10:15,138 --> 00:10:16,803
The wedding guests
all invited.

256
00:10:16,838 --> 00:10:18,573
And finally the the day came,
but not the groom.

257
00:10:18,608 --> 00:10:20,273
And i break from the tale now
only to mention

258
00:10:20,308 --> 00:10:22,043
That one should never
pass gas at the dinner table.

259
00:10:22,078 --> 00:10:24,212
Oh, excuse me.
Not at all, i'm sure!

260
00:10:24,646 --> 00:10:26,381
So the groom never showed,
he simply wrote a letter,

261
00:10:26,814 --> 00:10:28,983
A letter that miss havesham received
20 minutes before the wedding.

262
00:10:29,018 --> 00:10:29,851
At half nine,

263
00:10:30,284 --> 00:10:31,586
The time when she stopped
all the clocks in the house.

264
00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:34,622
But afterwards she laid waste to the
entire house, as you have seen it,

265
00:10:34,657 --> 00:10:36,357
And has never since
looked upon the light of day.

266
00:10:36,392 --> 00:10:37,893
And the story ends, pip,
with me suggesting

267
00:10:37,928 --> 00:10:39,528
That one should never
pull out their wee-Wee

268
00:10:39,563 --> 00:10:41,129
And check it for scabs
whilst at the table.

269
00:10:41,164 --> 00:10:42,664
Terribly sorry,
pocket.

270
00:10:42,699 --> 00:10:44,130
Not at all, i'm sure!

271
00:10:44,165 --> 00:10:46,334
And so, pip spent the next
several months

272
00:10:46,369 --> 00:10:48,034
Learning how to be
a gentleman.

273
00:10:48,069 --> 00:10:49,804
He was schooled
in several languages.

274
00:10:50,238 --> 00:10:51,938
He was taught fencing
and marksmanship.

275
00:10:51,973 --> 00:10:54,540
And he was shown how to dance
and how to eat box.

276
00:10:54,575 --> 00:10:57,612
And after it all, after weeks
and weeks of intense schooling,

277
00:10:58,046 --> 00:11:01,481
Pip was finally
a full-Fledged gentleman.

278
00:11:01,516 --> 00:11:05,420
Proud of himself, pip decided
to pay miss havesham a visit

279
00:11:05,455 --> 00:11:07,553
To thank her
for her generosity

280
00:11:07,588 --> 00:11:11,059
And to see if he was indeed now,
good enough for estella.

281
00:11:11,492 --> 00:11:12,360
Good evening,
miss havesham.

282
00:11:12,794 --> 00:11:13,626
Come closer, pip.

283
00:11:13,661 --> 00:11:15,830
My, you're quite the
gentleman now, aren't you?

284
00:11:15,865 --> 00:11:16,831
Thanks to you.

285
00:11:16,866 --> 00:11:17,964
Perhaps.

286
00:11:17,999 --> 00:11:19,300
Estella's been off
to school as well.

287
00:11:19,734 --> 00:11:21,000
She's become
quite the lady.

288
00:11:21,035 --> 00:11:22,987
Would you like to see
a picture of her?

289
00:11:23,022 --> 00:11:24,939
Oh my, she is even
prettier than before.

290
00:11:24,974 --> 00:11:27,542
Oh, you love her,
don't you, pip?

291
00:11:27,577 --> 00:11:28,409
I don't know, i mean,

292
00:11:28,843 --> 00:11:30,144
I think about her
every day.

293
00:11:30,179 --> 00:11:31,446
Do you know what
love is, pip?

294
00:11:31,879 --> 00:11:33,146
It is blind devotion,

295
00:11:33,181 --> 00:11:35,748
Unquestioning self humiliation,
utter submission.

296
00:11:35,783 --> 00:11:38,820
Trust and belief against yourself
and against the whole world,

297
00:11:39,253 --> 00:11:41,856
Giving up your whole
heart and soul to smiter.

298
00:11:41,891 --> 00:11:42,689
Right-O.

299
00:11:42,724 --> 00:11:43,990
Love her, pip.

300
00:11:44,025 --> 00:11:47,495
I developed her into what she
is so that she might... be loved.

301
00:11:47,530 --> 00:11:49,195
Yes, but,
where will i find her?

302
00:11:49,230 --> 00:11:50,965
There's a dance at the
palace tomorrow night,

303
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,231
Estella will be there.

304
00:11:52,266 --> 00:11:54,652
Go and seek her out,
and love her, love her.

305
00:11:54,687 --> 00:11:57,038
Thank you, miss havesham,
for everything.

306
00:11:57,472 --> 00:11:59,172
I'm the happiest boy
in the land!

307
00:11:59,207 --> 00:12:01,375
And if she wounds you,
love her,

308
00:12:01,410 --> 00:12:03,509
If she tears your heart
into pieces,

309
00:12:03,544 --> 00:12:05,713
And as you get older
it will tear deeper...

310
00:12:05,748 --> 00:12:06,714
Love her.

311
00:12:11,786 --> 00:12:14,388
Yes, our young pip
had come a long way.

312
00:12:14,423 --> 00:12:16,956
From the apprentice
of a blacksmith

313
00:12:16,991 --> 00:12:20,027
To a fine young gentleman
of great expectations.

314
00:12:20,461 --> 00:12:24,365
And now he was to finally see his
beloved estella, again, at a grand ball

315
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:26,933
Held by the king
of england, tony blair.

316
00:12:26,968 --> 00:12:29,570
It was here that pip would
finally and formally ask estella

317
00:12:30,004 --> 00:12:31,270
To be his girlfriend,

318
00:12:31,305 --> 00:12:33,908
And all would be
right with the world.

319
00:12:39,547 --> 00:12:40,813
Hello, estella.

320
00:12:40,848 --> 00:12:43,017
Pip, my goodness,
how you've changed.

321
00:12:43,451 --> 00:12:44,752
Yes, i've become
a gentleman.

322
00:12:44,787 --> 00:12:46,288
May i?

323
00:12:46,323 --> 00:12:47,789
I suppose.

324
00:12:49,957 --> 00:12:52,126
So how is it that you've
learned to dress and dance?

325
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:54,260
Well, i was sent to be
schooled in london.

326
00:12:54,295 --> 00:12:56,898
I see, and you no longer live
with the blacksmith?

327
00:12:56,933 --> 00:12:58,633
Oh, i see joe
once in a while,

328
00:12:59,066 --> 00:13:00,368
But i don't have much
in common with him anymore,

329
00:13:00,802 --> 00:13:02,103
Now that i'm
a gentleman and all.

330
00:13:02,138 --> 00:13:03,404
Naturally.

331
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:08,176
It is wonderful to
see you again, estella.

332
00:13:08,211 --> 00:13:09,442
Is it, why?

333
00:13:09,477 --> 00:13:10,778
Because i believe
i am in love with you.

334
00:13:11,212 --> 00:13:12,947
Pip, you must know
that i have no heart.

335
00:13:13,381 --> 00:13:14,647
I think you do.

336
00:13:14,682 --> 00:13:16,851
Oh, i have a heart to be
shot or stabbed in, no doubt.

337
00:13:16,886 --> 00:13:19,020
And if it ceased to beat,
i should ceased to be, but,

338
00:13:19,453 --> 00:13:21,622
You know what i mean,
i have no softness there,

339
00:13:21,657 --> 00:13:23,158
No sympathy, sentiment.

340
00:13:23,193 --> 00:13:24,624
I see past that, estella,

341
00:13:24,659 --> 00:13:26,828
I see a little girl who
wants to be warm and kind.

342
00:13:26,863 --> 00:13:29,231
Hey, estella,
let's get outta here.

343
00:13:29,266 --> 00:13:31,599
All right, steve,
just one moment.

344
00:13:32,033 --> 00:13:33,299
Who, who is that?

345
00:13:33,334 --> 00:13:35,503
That is steve,
he is 17 and has a car.

346
00:13:35,937 --> 00:13:38,105
I see, and you fancy
this steve fellow?

347
00:13:38,140 --> 00:13:39,841
I should,
he's my boyfriend.

348
00:13:39,876 --> 00:13:40,673
Boyfriend!

349
00:13:40,708 --> 00:13:41,974
What's the matter,
pip?

350
00:13:42,009 --> 00:13:43,744
I don't understand,
i did everything right.

351
00:13:43,779 --> 00:13:45,063
I stopped being
a poor commoner.

352
00:13:45,098 --> 00:13:46,347
I even blew off
my loving joe!

353
00:13:46,781 --> 00:13:48,950
It's, it's the way it goes
sometimes, pip.

354
00:13:48,985 --> 00:13:50,650
He's 17 and has a car.

355
00:13:50,685 --> 00:13:54,589
I'm-I'm very...
i'm- Leaving.

356
00:14:00,228 --> 00:14:02,396
Miss havesham, you have to
talk to estella,

357
00:14:02,431 --> 00:14:04,096
She's going out with-

358
00:14:04,131 --> 00:14:07,602
Well, well, well,
if it isn't mr. Pip.

359
00:14:07,637 --> 00:14:09,302
Miss havesham,
but i-

360
00:14:09,337 --> 00:14:11,072
Don't they make a
handsome couple, pip?

361
00:14:11,505 --> 00:14:12,807
Look at the way
he holds her hand.

362
00:14:12,842 --> 00:14:14,507
But i don't
understand.

363
00:14:14,542 --> 00:14:17,712
You sent me away to become a gentleman
so thaticould be with estella.

364
00:14:18,012 --> 00:14:20,615
Things aren't always
what they seem, pip.

365
00:14:21,048 --> 00:14:24,952
Oh, what's the matter,
did she break your heart?

366
00:14:25,386 --> 00:14:28,856
Well, i suppose that if you
set out to break my heart,

367
00:14:28,891 --> 00:14:30,825
You did a very good
job of it...

368
00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:32,760
Because it certainly
does hurt.

369
00:14:33,194 --> 00:14:34,894
Yes, tell me about the pain.

370
00:14:34,929 --> 00:14:37,965
Tell me about the crushing
and the prickly things.

371
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,002
It's as if... someone has
a hold of my heart

372
00:14:41,037 --> 00:14:43,135
And is squeezing it
very tightly.

373
00:14:43,170 --> 00:14:45,339
Yes, and it is somewhat
difficult to breathe.

374
00:14:45,539 --> 00:14:47,039
Hey, wait a second!

375
00:14:47,074 --> 00:14:50,111
You mean that this whole thing
was just a setup by your mom?

376
00:14:50,146 --> 00:14:52,514
Is your heart broken as well?
Tell me all about it.

377
00:14:52,549 --> 00:14:54,882
But, why do you make
your daughter hurt people?

378
00:14:54,917 --> 00:14:57,016
Why?
Well, that's simple.

379
00:14:57,051 --> 00:14:59,654
Because i need the tears
of brokenhearted men

380
00:14:59,689 --> 00:15:01,787
To use in my
"genesis" device.

381
00:15:01,822 --> 00:15:05,691
You see, my foolish child,
i am growing very old.

382
00:15:05,726 --> 00:15:09,630
But tonight i will fuse my soul
into estella's once and for all,

383
00:15:09,665 --> 00:15:13,534
And then i can go on breaking
men's hearts for another generation.

384
00:15:13,968 --> 00:15:15,234
What the hell!

385
00:15:15,269 --> 00:15:18,072
Estella, prepare yourself
for the genesis platform.

386
00:15:18,306 --> 00:15:20,006
Oh, no you don't,
you're my girl,

387
00:15:20,041 --> 00:15:22,643
And i'm not letting you
walk out on me!

388
00:15:23,945 --> 00:15:25,645
What the!

389
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:27,380
And as for you, pip,

390
00:15:27,415 --> 00:15:30,017
My robot monkeys should
take care of you.

391
00:15:31,752 --> 00:15:33,487
Ahh!

392
00:15:39,126 --> 00:15:41,295
Pip, pip old chap?

393
00:15:41,330 --> 00:15:42,995
Joe?

394
00:15:43,030 --> 00:15:45,164
That's right,
you're safe and warm now.

395
00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:47,333
Joe found you lying face down
in the street, mr. Pip.

396
00:15:47,368 --> 00:15:49,537
You were in such a state, you've been
unconscious here for nearly three hours.

397
00:15:49,971 --> 00:15:51,671
Miss havesham!

398
00:15:51,706 --> 00:15:54,308
She has all the men who have had their
hearts broken by estella trapped in her house.

399
00:15:54,742 --> 00:15:56,442
Oh, why would she have
wasted all that time

400
00:15:56,477 --> 00:15:58,212
Sending me to school and
turning me into a gentleman?

401
00:15:58,247 --> 00:15:59,478
Well, about that, pip,

402
00:15:59,513 --> 00:16:02,116
There's another person
who wants to see you.

403
00:16:02,151 --> 00:16:05,117
'Ello, pip,
do you remember me?

404
00:16:05,152 --> 00:16:07,720
I'll rip off your arms
and shove 'em up your arse!

405
00:16:07,755 --> 00:16:11,225
Why, you're the escaped convict
i helped a long time ago.

406
00:16:11,260 --> 00:16:13,394
Yes, after you helped me
i moved to wales

407
00:16:13,429 --> 00:16:15,129
And made something
of myself.

408
00:16:15,164 --> 00:16:15,962
If it weren't for you

409
00:16:15,997 --> 00:16:17,732
I'd have never
become a millionaire.

410
00:16:18,165 --> 00:16:20,299
He's the one that sent
you to london, pip!

411
00:16:20,334 --> 00:16:23,371
He's the one that sent you off
to be a gentleman!

412
00:16:23,406 --> 00:16:25,539
You? But why?

413
00:16:25,973 --> 00:16:28,541
Because back then you treated
me like any other person.

414
00:16:28,576 --> 00:16:31,178
You weren't a snob and you helped
me like you would a rich man.

415
00:16:31,612 --> 00:16:34,215
Oh dear, all this time i thought
it was miss havesham.

416
00:16:34,648 --> 00:16:36,349
She totally
let me believe it.

417
00:16:36,384 --> 00:16:38,119
I tried to tell you, pip,
she's a vengeful, spiteful woman

418
00:16:38,552 --> 00:16:39,854
Who wanted nothing more
than to see you hurt

419
00:16:39,889 --> 00:16:41,606
Along with the rest
of the male sex.

420
00:16:41,641 --> 00:16:43,289
Well, i've certainly
learned a lot.

421
00:16:43,324 --> 00:16:45,059
That being a gentleman doesn't
mean learning to dance

422
00:16:45,493 --> 00:16:46,759
Or proper table manners.

423
00:16:46,794 --> 00:16:48,529
It means being
a gentle man,

424
00:16:48,564 --> 00:16:50,281
Gentle to everyone.

425
00:16:50,316 --> 00:16:51,964
Right-O, pip, right-O.

426
00:16:51,999 --> 00:16:54,602
And now i suppose there's
only thing left to do.

427
00:16:54,637 --> 00:16:55,868
What's that, pip?

428
00:16:55,903 --> 00:16:58,939
If miss havesham is determined
to do this to others...

429
00:16:58,974 --> 00:17:00,674
Let's go kick her ass!

430
00:17:00,709 --> 00:17:01,542
Yeah!

431
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:09,350
And now we come to the final act
of the dickens' classic tale

432
00:17:09,784 --> 00:17:12,386
In which the stage is set
for an epic showdown.

433
00:17:12,820 --> 00:17:15,423
Miss havesham's robot monkeys
prove a formidable foe, but,

434
00:17:15,856 --> 00:17:18,242
Pip is not about to let
estella's soul

435
00:17:18,277 --> 00:17:20,593
Be forever consumed
by the genesis device.

436
00:17:20,628 --> 00:17:24,965
And now the thrilling conclusion
of "great expectations"!

437
00:17:28,869 --> 00:17:30,136
Are you ready, estella?

438
00:17:30,171 --> 00:17:31,906
Are you ready
to complete the cycle?

439
00:17:32,339 --> 00:17:33,841
Yes, mother.

440
00:17:36,243 --> 00:17:38,612
Not so fast,
you ugly ancient bitch!

441
00:17:38,846 --> 00:17:40,546
Pip?

442
00:17:40,581 --> 00:17:44,051
Your man-Hating days
are over, havesham!

443
00:17:44,086 --> 00:17:45,751
Quite the contrary,
blacksmith,

444
00:17:45,786 --> 00:17:48,823
My revenge on the male race
is only about to begin.

445
00:17:48,858 --> 00:17:50,523
Dear god, pip, look!

446
00:17:50,558 --> 00:17:53,160
Estella, help me,
i'm your boyfriend!

447
00:17:53,195 --> 00:17:54,860
So am i.
And me.

448
00:17:54,895 --> 00:17:57,064
We were all estella's boyfriends
at one time or another.

449
00:17:57,498 --> 00:17:58,365
Now, we're doomed.

450
00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:00,066
Yes, cry away, males.

451
00:18:00,101 --> 00:18:02,703
Once your tears have collected
into the genesis device,

452
00:18:02,738 --> 00:18:04,872
The fusion of estella and me
will be complete.

453
00:18:05,306 --> 00:18:06,173
You won't get away
with this!

454
00:18:06,607 --> 00:18:08,342
Won't i?

455
00:18:12,246 --> 00:18:15,065
Let the
transformation begin.

456
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:17,885
Pip, she started
the device!

457
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:21,355
Pocket, get over there
and do whatever it takes

458
00:18:21,390 --> 00:18:23,090
To keep those blokes
from crying.

459
00:18:23,125 --> 00:18:23,958
Right-O, pip.

460
00:18:24,391 --> 00:18:25,658
It begins.

461
00:18:25,693 --> 00:18:27,428
Come, estella, you can't want
to be part of this!

462
00:18:27,463 --> 00:18:30,030
It is...
what i was raised for.

463
00:18:31,765 --> 00:18:33,934
Hello, gentleman, oh whatever
you do, please do not cry.

464
00:18:33,969 --> 00:18:36,103
Havesham's device fuels itself
on your tears, i'm afraid.

465
00:18:36,138 --> 00:18:37,369
How are we
not to cry?

466
00:18:37,404 --> 00:18:39,140
Our hearts have been broken,
our lives ruined

467
00:18:39,175 --> 00:18:40,406
And now we are set to die.

468
00:18:40,441 --> 00:18:43,442
Yes, but just think about...
panda bears.

469
00:18:43,477 --> 00:18:46,080
Oh, they're so cuddly and sweet,
panda bears are.

470
00:18:46,115 --> 00:18:48,414
What silly little
noses they have.

471
00:18:48,449 --> 00:18:50,816
Panda bears make me sad,
they're almost extinct.

472
00:18:50,851 --> 00:18:53,020
Oh, right, right, let's not
think about panda bears then.

473
00:18:53,454 --> 00:18:55,189
Let's think about...
swimming.

474
00:18:55,224 --> 00:18:56,889
Oh, what jolly fun
swimming is

475
00:18:56,924 --> 00:19:00,394
With a splishy splash and
a hold-Your-Breath-Tight.

476
00:19:00,594 --> 00:19:01,262
Yes.

477
00:19:01,695 --> 00:19:04,732
Get out of that chair,
you old cow!

478
00:19:04,767 --> 00:19:06,467
Grrlalaa!

479
00:19:06,901 --> 00:19:08,167
Estella, listen to me,

480
00:19:08,202 --> 00:19:10,070
You are a wonderful girl,
with a kind heart.

481
00:19:10,105 --> 00:19:11,672
I told you, pip,
i have no heart.

482
00:19:11,707 --> 00:19:12,938
But you do!

483
00:19:12,973 --> 00:19:15,142
And i shall prove it
to you once and for all.

484
00:19:16,877 --> 00:19:18,612
Look at this
adorable little bunny.

485
00:19:18,647 --> 00:19:20,781
Oh my, he's very cute.

486
00:19:20,816 --> 00:19:22,047
You see that?

487
00:19:22,082 --> 00:19:23,384
A heartless person wouldn't
care at all about this bunny,

488
00:19:23,419 --> 00:19:25,553
They'd just as soon
break its neck.

489
00:19:27,288 --> 00:19:29,456
Oh... but look at
this bunny.

490
00:19:29,491 --> 00:19:30,723
There, you see that?

491
00:19:30,758 --> 00:19:33,360
You have too big a heart
to kill two baby bunnies.

492
00:19:35,095 --> 00:19:36,562
Right.

493
00:19:36,597 --> 00:19:38,015
Oh, what fun it is
to collect stamps!

494
00:19:38,050 --> 00:19:39,433
Lick the backs,
put them into books,

495
00:19:39,867 --> 00:19:41,168
All neat and tidy with their
smashing little pictures

496
00:19:41,602 --> 00:19:42,868
And happy bright colors.

497
00:19:42,903 --> 00:19:45,506
My father died in a stamp
collecting accident.

498
00:19:45,639 --> 00:19:47,675
Right, let's not talk about
stamp collecting then.

499
00:19:47,710 --> 00:19:48,976
Let's talk about...

500
00:19:49,143 --> 00:19:50,242
Ice skating!

501
00:19:50,277 --> 00:19:51,977
Oh, what fun
ice skating is!

502
00:19:52,012 --> 00:19:53,747
Who can catch me, who can
catch the ice skating king?

503
00:19:53,782 --> 00:19:55,014
That's me.

504
00:19:55,049 --> 00:19:56,784
I can't fight 'em off
no more!

505
00:19:56,819 --> 00:19:58,085
Nine, nine baby bunnies.

506
00:19:58,519 --> 00:20:00,254
A person with a heart could
never kill nine baby bunnies.

507
00:20:00,688 --> 00:20:02,623
So, you do have too big
a heart to-

508
00:20:02,658 --> 00:20:04,557
10 baby bunnies.

509
00:20:04,592 --> 00:20:05,858
There's too many
of 'em!

510
00:20:05,893 --> 00:20:08,460
Please, sirs,
you must not cry.

511
00:20:08,495 --> 00:20:11,532
We can't help it,
you're boring us to tears.

512
00:20:14,568 --> 00:20:16,070
Pip, it's too late!

513
00:20:16,303 --> 00:20:18,906
26 baby bunnies.

514
00:20:19,340 --> 00:20:21,942
I don't want to, i don't
see the point in this. What?

515
00:20:22,176 --> 00:20:23,794
I don't want to
kill any more of them.

516
00:20:23,829 --> 00:20:25,412
There, you see,
you do have a heart!

517
00:20:25,846 --> 00:20:26,679
You think so?

518
00:20:26,714 --> 00:20:28,449
Let me see it,
maybe i can kill it.

519
00:20:28,484 --> 00:20:29,750
No, no, i'm sure of it.

520
00:20:30,184 --> 00:20:31,919
You have a heart,
you want your own life.

521
00:20:32,353 --> 00:20:34,521
Come with me now!

522
00:20:34,556 --> 00:20:35,823
Yeah...

523
00:20:42,763 --> 00:20:44,281
Nooo!

524
00:20:44,316 --> 00:20:45,799
Ahhh!

525
00:20:46,233 --> 00:20:48,835
Ooh, top smart, pip!

526
00:20:48,870 --> 00:20:51,438
You did it, pip!

527
00:20:54,041 --> 00:20:57,511
Well, i guess old miss havesham
won't be taking any revenge

528
00:20:57,546 --> 00:20:59,211
On any more blokes, eh?

529
00:20:59,246 --> 00:21:02,283
Yes, her poor miserable life
is finally over.

530
00:21:02,318 --> 00:21:03,584
You're released
from her now, estella.

531
00:21:04,018 --> 00:21:06,186
Now we can begin
our life together.

532
00:21:06,221 --> 00:21:08,355
Yes, yes,
my small-Testicled love.

533
00:21:08,789 --> 00:21:10,489
Oh, i'm so glad everything
has worked out.

534
00:21:10,524 --> 00:21:13,127
Where are all my little bunnies
that you borrowed then, pip?

535
00:21:13,162 --> 00:21:16,180
And they all lived
happily ever after.

536
00:21:16,215 --> 00:21:19,659
Except for pocket
who died of hepatitis b.

537
00:21:19,694 --> 00:21:23,103
So ends charles dickens'
"great expectations".

538
00:21:23,537 --> 00:21:26,105
We hope you now have a deeper
appreciation for pip,

539
00:21:26,140 --> 00:21:29,610
And indeed, all masterpieces
of literature like this one.

540
00:21:29,645 --> 00:21:32,646
Until next time,
i'm a british person.

541
00:21:32,681 --> 00:21:34,381
Good night.
