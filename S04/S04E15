Captioning made possible by
comedy central

2
00:00:09,154 --> 00:00:10,437
? I'm going down
to south park?

3
00:00:10,472 --> 00:00:11,721
? Gonna have
myself a time?

4
00:00:12,155 --> 00:00:13,456
? Friendly faces
everywhere?

5
00:00:13,890 --> 00:00:15,392
? Humble folks
without temptation?

6
00:00:15,427 --> 00:00:17,044
? Going down
to south park?

7
00:00:17,079 --> 00:00:18,521
? Gonna leave my
woes behind?

8
00:00:18,556 --> 00:00:19,963
? Ample parking
day or night?

9
00:00:20,397 --> 00:00:22,132
? People spouting
"howdy neighbor"?

10
00:00:22,167 --> 00:00:23,433
? Headed on up
to south park?

11
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:25,168
? Gonna see if
i can't unwind?

12
00:00:28,638 --> 00:00:30,373
? So come on down
to south park?

13
00:00:30,408 --> 00:00:32,108
? And meet some
friends of mine?

14
00:00:35,378 --> 00:00:37,113
All right, children,
as i'm sure you all remember,

15
00:00:37,547 --> 00:00:39,716
Today we're gonna continue
our biology lesson

16
00:00:39,751 --> 00:00:41,885
By dissecting an organism.

17
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:43,151
Yeah!
Woo-Hoo!

18
00:00:43,186 --> 00:00:44,921
Now, what we are going to
dissect today

19
00:00:44,956 --> 00:00:46,656
Is the west indian manatee.

20
00:00:47,090 --> 00:00:49,224
Manatees are mammals
that live in the oceans

21
00:00:49,259 --> 00:00:51,861
And are often called
"the gentle clowns of the sea".

22
00:00:51,896 --> 00:00:54,464
Uh, miss choksondik,
aren't manatees endangered?

23
00:00:54,499 --> 00:00:56,164
They sure are, wendy.

24
00:00:56,199 --> 00:00:58,368
And that's why we must learn
what's inside them.

25
00:00:58,802 --> 00:01:01,369
Now, we don't have quite enough
manatees to go around

26
00:01:01,404 --> 00:01:03,573
So i think we're gonna have to
split up into groups of four.

27
00:01:03,773 --> 00:01:05,742
Hey, ours is
still alive!

28
00:01:05,777 --> 00:01:07,494
Oh, hold on.

29
00:01:07,529 --> 00:01:09,177
Uh, uh!

30
00:01:09,212 --> 00:01:12,682
Now, children, our first incision
will be along the abdomen.

31
00:01:12,717 --> 00:01:13,515
I can't do it, dude.

32
00:01:13,550 --> 00:01:14,417
Oh, don't be
such a baby.

33
00:01:14,851 --> 00:01:15,718
You do it, kenny.

34
00:01:15,753 --> 00:01:16,985
Unh-Uh.

35
00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:18,755
Come on, kenny, i'll give you
five bucks to do it.

36
00:01:18,790 --> 00:01:20,455
Five bucks!

37
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:22,659
Too bad cartman's missing this,
he must be really sick.

38
00:01:22,694 --> 00:01:23,960
Say, terrance,

39
00:01:24,127 --> 00:01:25,695
This body appears to have
been moved since the murder.

40
00:01:25,730 --> 00:01:27,864
Look at the forensic evidence
around the torso.

41
00:01:27,899 --> 00:01:29,165
I don't see anything.

42
00:01:29,599 --> 00:01:30,900
Look closer.

43
00:01:31,334 --> 00:01:33,034
Closer.

44
00:01:33,069 --> 00:01:36,106
I still don't see
anything, phillip.

45
00:01:36,141 --> 00:01:36,973
Wait, wait.

46
00:01:37,407 --> 00:01:38,708
I know what's gonna
happen, mom.

47
00:01:38,743 --> 00:01:39,974
You wanna know
what's gonna happen?

48
00:01:40,009 --> 00:01:42,178
Keep looking, terrance, the forensic
evidence is right around here.

49
00:01:49,552 --> 00:01:51,252
Whoa, that totally
surprised me!

50
00:01:51,287 --> 00:01:53,890
I can't believe how this show
manages to stay fresh, huh, mom?

51
00:01:53,925 --> 00:01:54,757
Yes, sweetie.

52
00:01:54,792 --> 00:01:56,059
Mom...

53
00:01:56,493 --> 00:01:58,661
Can you go make me a toaster-Pastry-
Chocolate-Mix-Butter bar?

54
00:01:58,696 --> 00:02:01,264
Oh, honey, why don't you
go make it yourself.

55
00:02:01,698 --> 00:02:03,832
Mommy's expecting
some company.

56
00:02:03,867 --> 00:02:06,469
God, i have to do
everything around here!

57
00:02:08,204 --> 00:02:09,506
? You'll never find...?

58
00:02:11,674 --> 00:02:13,626
?... No matter
where you search?

59
00:02:13,661 --> 00:02:15,578
? Someone who
loves you tender?

60
00:02:15,613 --> 00:02:17,313
? Like i do?

61
00:02:22,085 --> 00:02:24,254
? I'm not braggin'
on myself, baby?

62
00:02:24,289 --> 00:02:25,954
? But the-?

63
00:02:25,989 --> 00:02:28,123
What the hell's
going on?

64
00:02:28,158 --> 00:02:32,495
Uh, sweetie, your friends wanted
to have a "talk" with you.

65
00:02:32,530 --> 00:02:34,629
Eric, your friends
and your family

66
00:02:34,664 --> 00:02:38,134
Are all concerned about
your weight, m'kay.

67
00:02:38,169 --> 00:02:39,002
What?

68
00:02:39,435 --> 00:02:40,737
We believe that you
might have a problem.

69
00:02:41,171 --> 00:02:42,437
You're goddamn right
i have a problem!

70
00:02:42,472 --> 00:02:44,207
"Terrance and phillip" is on
and i don't have anywhere to sit!

71
00:02:44,641 --> 00:02:45,508
Now what the hell
is this?!

72
00:02:45,942 --> 00:02:46,809
It's called
intervention, eric.

73
00:02:47,243 --> 00:02:48,510
Your friends and i
have all chipped in

74
00:02:48,545 --> 00:02:52,015
And we're going to send you up
to a weight management retreat.

75
00:02:52,050 --> 00:02:54,184
Fat camp?
Yes, fat camp.

76
00:02:54,617 --> 00:02:55,919
All right, i don't know who
the hell put you all up to this,

77
00:02:56,352 --> 00:02:58,955
But i am sure as hell not going
to any gay-Ass fat camp!

78
00:02:59,088 --> 00:03:00,655
Now, eric, all these
people came here

79
00:03:00,690 --> 00:03:03,293
And paid to send you to camp
because they care about you.

80
00:03:03,328 --> 00:03:04,993
Yeah, except for me.

81
00:03:05,028 --> 00:03:07,197
I just wanted to see the look
on your face when they told you.

82
00:03:07,630 --> 00:03:08,463
Mom, tell them.

83
00:03:08,498 --> 00:03:09,799
Tell them i'm not fat,
i'm just big-Boned.

84
00:03:10,233 --> 00:03:11,534
Tell them all the stories about
how everyone in your family

85
00:03:11,968 --> 00:03:13,269
Was big as a child but then
grew into their bodies.

86
00:03:13,703 --> 00:03:15,438
Oh, sweetie,
those were all lies.

87
00:03:15,872 --> 00:03:17,607
You're just fat.

88
00:03:19,776 --> 00:03:21,910
And now, we will be
removing the spleen.

89
00:03:21,945 --> 00:03:24,078
Notice how the manatee's
spleen is designed for-

90
00:03:24,113 --> 00:03:28,017
Ah, miss choksondik, can we have
a quick word with you? All right.

91
00:03:28,451 --> 00:03:31,054
Continue with the removal of the
spleen, children, i'll be right back.

92
00:03:31,089 --> 00:03:32,789
Oh, dude,
check this out.

93
00:03:32,824 --> 00:03:34,055
That's so gross.

94
00:03:34,090 --> 00:03:35,825
Hey, kenny, how much
for you to eat this?

95
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:36,658
I won't eat it.

96
00:03:36,693 --> 00:03:37,994
I'll give you 10 bucks
to eat it.

97
00:03:38,029 --> 00:03:39,260
I'll throw in five.

98
00:03:39,295 --> 00:03:40,995
And so apparently there's
been a little mix-Up.

99
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:43,633
The manatees were meant to go
to the denver shelter aquarium

100
00:03:43,668 --> 00:03:45,802
And the frogs
were meant to come here.

101
00:03:45,837 --> 00:03:47,068
Oh dear.

102
00:03:47,103 --> 00:03:48,803
I'll throw in a dollar! I got three.

103
00:03:48,838 --> 00:03:50,573
Come on, dude, all you gotta do
is eat it really fast.

104
00:03:50,608 --> 00:03:51,874
41 bucks.

105
00:03:54,043 --> 00:03:55,310
Eww-Hoo!
He did it.

106
00:03:55,345 --> 00:03:58,815
All right, children, now,
let's get back in our seats.

107
00:03:58,850 --> 00:04:02,285
Uh, we are now going to put
the manatees back together.

108
00:04:05,321 --> 00:04:07,490
And it has basketball courts
and tennis courts.

109
00:04:07,525 --> 00:04:10,960
And you can call mommy
anytime you want.

110
00:04:10,995 --> 00:04:13,528
Oh, sweetie-Kins,
don't be mad,

111
00:04:13,563 --> 00:04:15,263
I'm sure you're going to
have a good time.

112
00:04:15,298 --> 00:04:18,334
And when you come back,
you'll be all healthy and thin.

113
00:04:18,369 --> 00:04:21,371
Howdy there, i'm one of
the weight counselors here.

114
00:04:21,804 --> 00:04:23,071
This must be eric cartman.

115
00:04:23,106 --> 00:04:25,275
Yes, i'm afraid
he's a little moody.

116
00:04:25,310 --> 00:04:26,975
Oh, we'll change that.

117
00:04:27,010 --> 00:04:29,612
Hello, camper, my name is rick,
how are you doing?

118
00:04:29,647 --> 00:04:32,215
Well, i'm pissed off, rick,
how are you?

119
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:33,915
I'm doing great!

120
00:04:33,950 --> 00:04:35,685
Why don't you come on out
and we'll get you oriented.

121
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:37,854
I'll take care of him
from here, ma'am.

122
00:04:38,288 --> 00:04:40,023
Oh, well,
good-Bye, sweetie.

123
00:04:40,058 --> 00:04:41,723
Don't touch me.

124
00:04:41,758 --> 00:04:45,228
Eric, this is the beginning
of a whole new life for you!

125
00:04:50,433 --> 00:04:52,133
Have you got any candy?
No.

126
00:04:52,168 --> 00:04:53,903
My mom says i ain't to
eat no candy here,

127
00:04:53,938 --> 00:04:55,204
I'm supposed to
lose weight.

128
00:04:55,239 --> 00:04:56,506
All right!

129
00:04:56,939 --> 00:04:59,108
Everybody's here and that means
we can get down to business.

130
00:04:59,542 --> 00:05:00,843
Over the next few weeks
we're gonna learn

131
00:05:01,277 --> 00:05:03,012
That losing weight
is fun, right, gang?

132
00:05:03,047 --> 00:05:04,712
Right.

133
00:05:04,747 --> 00:05:07,784
Wait a second,
do you kids hear something?

134
00:05:07,819 --> 00:05:09,085
Why, i could've
swore that-

135
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:10,351
Rrrar!

136
00:05:10,386 --> 00:05:12,520
Oh no, kids,
it's glutinous fat!

137
00:05:12,555 --> 00:05:15,591
I'm gonna take over your body
and make you slow.

138
00:05:16,025 --> 00:05:17,760
Oh, what are we
going to do?

139
00:05:17,795 --> 00:05:19,027
Wait, i know.

140
00:05:19,062 --> 00:05:20,797
I can knock it out,
with?

141
00:05:20,832 --> 00:05:22,063
Exercise!

142
00:05:22,098 --> 00:05:23,833
And? Proper diet.

143
00:05:23,868 --> 00:05:25,099
Oh no!

144
00:05:25,134 --> 00:05:28,136
Exercise and proper diet
have killed me.

145
00:05:28,171 --> 00:05:31,207
I guess we took care of that
bad old fat, didn't we, kids?

146
00:05:31,641 --> 00:05:32,473
Yeah!

147
00:05:32,508 --> 00:05:33,775
Well, hold on a second,

148
00:05:33,810 --> 00:05:36,846
Because that glutinous fat was
really our good friend susan!

149
00:05:36,881 --> 00:05:39,032
Who's another
weight counselor!

150
00:05:39,067 --> 00:05:41,149
Heh, it was a lady
in a costume.

151
00:05:41,184 --> 00:05:43,786
Would somebody put this retard
out of his misery?

152
00:05:45,088 --> 00:05:45,920
What's the matter?

153
00:05:45,955 --> 00:05:46,823
Kenny's not feeling
so good.

154
00:05:47,256 --> 00:05:48,523
That manatee spleen
made him sick.

155
00:05:48,558 --> 00:05:49,859
Uh-Oh, i guess we shouldn't
have made him eat it.

156
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:52,860
Eww!

157
00:05:52,895 --> 00:05:55,281
Well, at least you got it
out of your system.

158
00:05:55,316 --> 00:05:57,667
Oh, dude, you can still
kind of see the spleen!

159
00:05:57,702 --> 00:05:58,933
How much, kenny?
What?!

160
00:05:58,968 --> 00:06:00,703
I'll give you five bucks
to eat your puke.

161
00:06:01,137 --> 00:06:02,004
I'm in for five.

162
00:06:02,039 --> 00:06:02,837
Oh, you guys.

163
00:06:02,872 --> 00:06:04,138
I got three.
Six.

164
00:06:04,173 --> 00:06:07,643
Uh, here, you can scoop it up
in my r. Kelly thermos.

165
00:06:10,246 --> 00:06:13,282
That's 19 bucks, kenny.

166
00:06:13,317 --> 00:06:14,584
Ohh!
Eww.

167
00:06:15,017 --> 00:06:16,284
Kick ass, dude!

168
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:18,019
Y'know, dude, there might
be something to this.

169
00:06:18,054 --> 00:06:21,524
Yeah, people are willing to pay big
money to see kenny do this stuff.

170
00:06:24,127 --> 00:06:26,729
Doing great, kids,
come on!

171
00:06:33,236 --> 00:06:35,370
This... is...
bull crap!

172
00:06:35,405 --> 00:06:37,573
Well, i sure enjoyed
my carrots and protein bar,

173
00:06:37,608 --> 00:06:38,875
How about you, gang?

174
00:06:38,910 --> 00:06:39,707
I'm starving.

175
00:06:39,742 --> 00:06:41,043
This is it,
i'm going to die here.

176
00:06:41,477 --> 00:06:42,779
I hope you all left room
for dessert-

177
00:06:43,212 --> 00:06:45,815
Soybean pudding
for everybody!

178
00:06:46,249 --> 00:06:48,418
Are you gonna eat
your soybean pudding?

179
00:06:48,851 --> 00:06:50,118
Take it, i can't
eat this crap!

180
00:06:50,153 --> 00:06:52,321
Me neither, i have to
have sugar or i'm gonna die.

181
00:06:52,356 --> 00:06:54,021
Yeah, well,
when i was in prison,

182
00:06:54,056 --> 00:06:56,442
We use to sneak stuff in
by hiding it up our ass.

183
00:06:56,477 --> 00:06:59,170
I've got some fudge hidden
up my ass, you want some?

184
00:06:59,205 --> 00:07:01,864
Pssh- Yeah, i'm not falling
for that one again.

185
00:07:04,033 --> 00:07:05,733
All right, clyde frog,

186
00:07:05,768 --> 00:07:08,371
We just gotta clear the
counselor building and we're free.

187
00:07:12,708 --> 00:07:14,409
We did it,
clyde frog!

188
00:07:14,444 --> 00:07:17,480
Now the only question is, do we go
home to our traitor mom and friends,

189
00:07:17,515 --> 00:07:20,082
Or do we start
a new life on the run?

190
00:07:20,117 --> 00:07:22,251
An ice cream truck!
Hey, wait!

191
00:07:22,286 --> 00:07:23,518
Boy, am i glad to see you.

192
00:07:23,553 --> 00:07:25,288
Can i interest you
in some ice cream?

193
00:07:25,323 --> 00:07:26,923
You're damn right
you can!

194
00:07:26,958 --> 00:07:28,524
Two "roller pops",
please.

195
00:07:28,758 --> 00:07:31,360
Alrighty, do you want
this kind or this kind?

196
00:07:31,395 --> 00:07:33,095
Huh? Oh!

197
00:07:34,831 --> 00:07:36,964
They tricked us
again, huh?

198
00:07:36,999 --> 00:07:39,567
Oh godammit,
let me out of here!

199
00:07:39,602 --> 00:07:42,638
Hang on, we'll be back at camp
in a matter of no time.

200
00:07:45,675 --> 00:07:46,976
They always get us.

201
00:07:47,410 --> 00:07:50,012
Sometimes it's an ice cream
truck, sometimes it's a taco stand.

202
00:07:50,047 --> 00:07:51,314
But they always
fool us.

203
00:07:51,349 --> 00:07:53,014
I can't help it.

204
00:07:53,049 --> 00:07:55,218
I'd give anything, any amount
of money for some candy.

205
00:07:55,651 --> 00:07:56,918
Hey, kids!

206
00:07:56,953 --> 00:07:59,121
Looks like we had some
attempted escapees again tonight.

207
00:07:59,555 --> 00:08:00,388
Escape-Aroo.

208
00:08:00,423 --> 00:08:02,591
Now, campers, i know that
camp is tough,

209
00:08:02,626 --> 00:08:04,725
But you have to believe
that you can do it.

210
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:06,496
And you have to know that
until you drop the weight

211
00:08:06,929 --> 00:08:08,230
You can't leave!

212
00:08:08,265 --> 00:08:09,497
There is no escape.

213
00:08:09,532 --> 00:08:11,232
So, let's just all
put on our "try hard" helmets

214
00:08:11,267 --> 00:08:13,436
And accept that the only way
for us to get out of camp

215
00:08:13,471 --> 00:08:14,937
Is to lose the weight!

216
00:08:14,972 --> 00:08:16,038
God dammit!

217
00:08:20,376 --> 00:08:21,677
Thanks for coming,
everybody.

218
00:08:22,111 --> 00:08:23,412
What's all this about,
mrs. Cartman,

219
00:08:23,846 --> 00:08:26,015
Is eric having trouble at his
weight management camp?

220
00:08:26,050 --> 00:08:26,883
We knew he
wouldn't make it.

221
00:08:27,316 --> 00:08:29,016
Oh, no,
quite the contrary.

222
00:08:29,051 --> 00:08:31,185
Eric showed up and
surprised me last night.

223
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:33,823
Ladies and gentlemen,
i would like to present to you

224
00:08:34,257 --> 00:08:35,992
The new eric cartman.

225
00:08:36,027 --> 00:08:37,293
Hey, dudes!

226
00:08:37,727 --> 00:08:38,993
Whoa!

227
00:08:39,028 --> 00:08:40,294
I don't believe it.

228
00:08:40,329 --> 00:08:43,366
Believe it, he lost
40 pounds at his fat camp.

229
00:08:43,401 --> 00:08:45,769
Eric,
that's fantastic, m'kay!

230
00:08:45,804 --> 00:08:48,137
Congratulations,
how do you feel?

231
00:08:48,571 --> 00:08:49,438
I feel awesome.

232
00:08:49,872 --> 00:08:51,572
What the hell did they do
with all the fat?

233
00:08:51,607 --> 00:08:53,307
That must've been enough to
last an eskimo family months.

234
00:08:53,342 --> 00:08:56,379
Y'know, kyle, there was a time when
your fat jokes would have gotten to me,

235
00:08:56,414 --> 00:08:58,513
But now i'm totally slim
and totally happy.

236
00:08:58,548 --> 00:09:01,584
In fact, i'd say i'm a little
bit trimmer than you, fat boy.

237
00:09:01,619 --> 00:09:03,284
Heh heh,
just kidding, kyle.

238
00:09:03,319 --> 00:09:05,922
I made some healthy
tofu pudding to celebrate.

239
00:09:06,355 --> 00:09:08,090
Who wants some?

240
00:09:08,125 --> 00:09:09,790
Me, me, me, me!

241
00:09:09,825 --> 00:09:11,994
Dude, i don't know if i'm
gonna like the new eric cartman.

242
00:09:12,428 --> 00:09:14,128
Did you like the old one? Good point.

243
00:09:14,163 --> 00:09:17,633
And now back to "jesus and pals"
on south park public access.

244
00:09:18,067 --> 00:09:21,068
Back to our courageous story of a
little boy's triumph over obesity.

245
00:09:21,103 --> 00:09:25,007
Eric, yea, you found that the spirit of
the lord inside you gave you strength.

246
00:09:25,042 --> 00:09:26,742
No, actually i found a diet
that totally works.

247
00:09:27,176 --> 00:09:28,911
A little boy
who overcame the odds.

248
00:09:29,345 --> 00:09:31,213
Let's hear it
for eric cartman!

249
00:09:33,249 --> 00:09:35,851
Well, our second guest tonight is
a young man named kenny mckormick

250
00:09:35,886 --> 00:09:37,587
Who is going to
eat dog crap.

251
00:09:37,622 --> 00:09:39,755
Kenny?

252
00:09:46,262 --> 00:09:47,997
Whoa!

253
00:09:57,106 --> 00:09:58,806
No!

254
00:09:58,841 --> 00:10:00,576
Yes!
Woo-Hoo!

255
00:10:01,010 --> 00:10:01,842
Yeah!

256
00:10:01,877 --> 00:10:04,046
Dammit, all i got was
a little golf clap.

257
00:10:04,081 --> 00:10:06,215
Thanks for coming on
the show, kenny. Sure.

258
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:07,481
Do it again!
Do it again!

259
00:10:07,516 --> 00:10:10,119
Hey kid, i'll give you 20 bucks
to eat a really old piece of bacon.

260
00:10:10,553 --> 00:10:11,819
This is ridiculous!

261
00:10:11,854 --> 00:10:15,324
So, kenny, how did you discover
that you had this talent?

262
00:10:15,359 --> 00:10:16,591
We thought of it, jesus.

263
00:10:16,626 --> 00:10:17,892
I mean, kenny's the one
that does it all,

264
00:10:17,927 --> 00:10:19,228
But we were the masterminds
of the whole thing.

265
00:10:19,662 --> 00:10:21,397
I can't say i approve
of this, my children.

266
00:10:21,432 --> 00:10:23,097
Huh, why not?

267
00:10:23,132 --> 00:10:25,735
Because kenny is only doing
things that anybody could do...

268
00:10:25,770 --> 00:10:27,001
For money.

269
00:10:27,036 --> 00:10:28,736
He's a prostitute.

270
00:10:28,771 --> 00:10:31,374
I'll pay him 50 bucks to eat
someone else's vomit.

271
00:10:31,409 --> 00:10:32,241
Yeah, go for it!
Yeah!

272
00:10:32,675 --> 00:10:33,542
What's a prostitute?

273
00:10:33,577 --> 00:10:34,844
I don't know.

274
00:10:37,013 --> 00:10:38,748
Hello there, children.

275
00:10:39,181 --> 00:10:40,014
Hey, chef! Hey, chef!

276
00:10:40,049 --> 00:10:42,218
Chef, what's a
prostitute?

277
00:10:42,253 --> 00:10:43,484
Dag nabbit, children!

278
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:44,820
How come every time
you come in here

279
00:10:45,254 --> 00:10:46,989
You gotta be asking me questions
i shouldn't be answering?

280
00:10:47,423 --> 00:10:49,592
"Chef, what's a clitoris?
What's a lesbian, chef?

281
00:10:49,627 --> 00:10:51,726
How come they call it
a 'rim job', chef?"

282
00:10:51,761 --> 00:10:53,496
For once, can't you just
come in here and say,

283
00:10:53,531 --> 00:10:55,248
"Hi, chef,
nice day, isn't it?"

284
00:10:55,283 --> 00:10:56,966
Hi, chef,
nice day, isn't it?

285
00:10:57,001 --> 00:10:58,666
It sure is,
thank you.

286
00:10:58,701 --> 00:11:00,436
Chef,
what's a prostitute?

287
00:11:00,636 --> 00:11:03,472
Unh-Uh, you children are gonna get me
in trouble with the principal again.

288
00:11:03,507 --> 00:11:04,774
Lunchtime,
i'm starved!

289
00:11:04,809 --> 00:11:06,509
Oh my god!
Eric?

290
00:11:06,544 --> 00:11:07,810
That's me.

291
00:11:08,244 --> 00:11:10,629
Chef was just about to
tell us what a prostitute is.

292
00:11:10,664 --> 00:11:13,141
Why do you need to know what
a prostitute is anyway?

293
00:11:13,176 --> 00:11:15,618
Because jesus told us that
kenny's a prostitute, is he?

294
00:11:15,653 --> 00:11:16,884
Yeah, am i?

295
00:11:16,919 --> 00:11:19,522
Well, no, of course kenny
is not a prostitute.

296
00:11:19,557 --> 00:11:20,788
Why?

297
00:11:20,823 --> 00:11:22,992
Well, because, children,
a prostitute is someone who...

298
00:11:23,027 --> 00:11:25,594
You can pay for
certain services.

299
00:11:25,629 --> 00:11:26,861
Like what?

300
00:11:26,896 --> 00:11:29,897
Like keeping you company
- Understand? No.

301
00:11:29,932 --> 00:11:32,101
You see, children, sometimes
a man needs to be with a woman,

302
00:11:32,136 --> 00:11:33,801
But sometimes,
when the lovin' is over,

303
00:11:33,836 --> 00:11:36,872
The woman just want to talk
and talk and talk and talk.

304
00:11:37,306 --> 00:11:40,342
? But a prostitute is someone
who would love you?

305
00:11:40,377 --> 00:11:43,379
? No matter who you are
or what you look like?

306
00:11:43,813 --> 00:11:45,981
Yes, it's true children.

307
00:11:46,415 --> 00:11:48,150
? That's not why you
pay a prostitute?

308
00:11:48,584 --> 00:11:50,753
? No, you don't
pay for her to stay?

309
00:11:50,788 --> 00:11:52,887
? You're paying her
to leave afterward?

310
00:11:52,922 --> 00:11:56,826
? That's why i praise the lord
for prostitute?

311
00:11:56,861 --> 00:11:59,446
Ladies and gentlemen,
mr. James taylor.

312
00:11:59,481 --> 00:12:01,623
? A prostitute is like
any other woman?

313
00:12:01,658 --> 00:12:03,766
? They all trade
something for sex?

314
00:12:03,801 --> 00:12:06,333
? And they do it well?

315
00:12:06,368 --> 00:12:09,405
? That's why i say
prostitutes, prostitutes?

316
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:13,274
They- Ohh!

317
00:12:13,309 --> 00:12:15,911
James taylor, what the hell
you doing in here,

318
00:12:15,946 --> 00:12:18,514
Singing about prostitutes
to the children?

319
00:12:18,549 --> 00:12:21,515
Get out of here!

320
00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:24,587
These children
tricked me!

321
00:12:33,262 --> 00:12:34,528
Oh, there you are.

322
00:12:34,563 --> 00:12:36,263
All right,
i got the goods-

323
00:12:36,298 --> 00:12:38,033
Some candy bars, a few donuts
and some beef gravy.

324
00:12:38,068 --> 00:12:39,734
Is anyone starting to
suspect anything?

325
00:12:39,769 --> 00:12:41,937
Nobody, your mom even thinks
i'm a skinny you.

326
00:12:41,972 --> 00:12:42,770
Awesome.

327
00:12:42,805 --> 00:12:43,672
All right,
throw it over.

328
00:12:44,106 --> 00:12:45,407
I want a bigger cut.

329
00:12:45,841 --> 00:12:47,108
What?!
Risking my ass,

330
00:12:47,143 --> 00:12:48,010
Running around in that stupid
town pretending to be you

331
00:12:48,444 --> 00:12:49,745
And collecting all the food
to bring up here.

332
00:12:50,179 --> 00:12:51,480
All you have to do is sit back
and sell it to all the fat kids!

333
00:12:51,914 --> 00:12:52,782
All right, all right,
keep your voice down!

334
00:12:53,215 --> 00:12:54,733
I'll bump you up
to 10%.

335
00:12:54,768 --> 00:12:56,217
20.
Suck my balls, 20!

336
00:12:56,252 --> 00:12:57,553
Fine, then i shall
bid you good day.

337
00:12:57,588 --> 00:12:59,288
Wait, wait, wait-
Fine, 20.

338
00:12:59,722 --> 00:13:02,324
But just remember that your parents think
you're at the drug rehab center next door.

339
00:13:02,359 --> 00:13:04,927
You blow your cover
and we're both screwed.

340
00:13:08,597 --> 00:13:10,531
You guys, you have to
check this tape out!

341
00:13:10,566 --> 00:13:12,301
Hey, we're trying to study,
finals are tomorrow.

342
00:13:12,735 --> 00:13:14,001
No, dude,
check this out.

343
00:13:14,036 --> 00:13:17,072
It's a video of this kid who
does all kinds of crazy stuff.

344
00:13:17,506 --> 00:13:18,773
Check it out!

345
00:13:18,808 --> 00:13:20,976
He jumped into a port-A-Potty
at a construction site

346
00:13:21,011 --> 00:13:22,711
And stayed there
for four days!

347
00:13:23,145 --> 00:13:24,013
Whoa!

348
00:13:27,483 --> 00:13:28,584
Eww!

349
00:13:28,784 --> 00:13:29,868
Oh, gross!
Sick!

350
00:13:29,903 --> 00:13:30,918
That's awesome!

351
00:13:30,953 --> 00:13:33,122
Hey, guys,
check this out!

352
00:13:33,989 --> 00:13:38,726
Get ready for the...

353
00:13:38,761 --> 00:13:40,027
And now,
here's your host,

354
00:13:40,062 --> 00:13:42,665
The kid who will do
anything to himself for money...

355
00:13:43,098 --> 00:13:47,002
Kraaaazy kenny!

356
00:13:47,436 --> 00:13:49,605
Kenny, through the past weeks,
we've seen you eat mice,

357
00:13:50,039 --> 00:13:52,208
Pretend to kill newborn babies
to shock their mothers

358
00:13:52,243 --> 00:13:53,960
And wash your hair
with battery acid.

359
00:13:53,995 --> 00:13:55,678
The question on
all our minds is,

360
00:13:55,713 --> 00:13:58,714
What are you
gonna do next?

361
00:14:01,317 --> 00:14:03,450
Oh, ho ho!
You heard him, folks.

362
00:14:03,485 --> 00:14:06,522
Kenny is going to give
a sensual full-Body massage

363
00:14:06,956 --> 00:14:09,124
To his own grandfather.

364
00:14:09,558 --> 00:14:10,860
Oh ho!
Woo-Hoo!

365
00:14:22,571 --> 00:14:24,523
Oh! Oh!

366
00:14:24,558 --> 00:14:26,440
Oh!
Oh!

367
00:14:26,475 --> 00:14:28,210
Wow, this is kenny's
best show ever!

368
00:14:28,245 --> 00:14:29,476
This is so juvenile.

369
00:14:29,511 --> 00:14:31,247
Cartman, what the hell's
the matter with you?

370
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:32,982
Yeah, you've gotten lame since
you got skinny, what's up?

371
00:14:33,017 --> 00:14:34,248
Nothing.

372
00:14:34,283 --> 00:14:36,886
Hey, can i have some of
that licorice to take home?

373
00:14:36,921 --> 00:14:39,019
All right, campers,
good work today.

374
00:14:39,054 --> 00:14:43,826
Lights out and we'll see you tomorrow
for more exercise and proper diet.

375
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:45,778
All "beddy-Byes" for
the night, are they?

376
00:14:45,813 --> 00:14:47,296
I don't know what
we're doing wrong, susan,

377
00:14:47,331 --> 00:14:49,048
These kids aren't
losing the weight.

378
00:14:49,083 --> 00:14:50,766
We'll just have to
give them more time.

379
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:52,067
They'll do it.

380
00:14:52,102 --> 00:14:55,069
They'll do it!

381
00:14:55,104 --> 00:14:57,706
All right,
they're gone.

382
00:14:59,441 --> 00:15:02,877
The cartman store
is open!

383
00:15:02,912 --> 00:15:05,514
Two donuts and a pack
of licorice, please.

384
00:15:05,549 --> 00:15:08,117
Two donuts and
a pack of licorice.

385
00:15:08,152 --> 00:15:11,587
Hello, tony,
the usual?

386
00:15:12,888 --> 00:15:14,588
Why are you
crying, chad?

387
00:15:14,623 --> 00:15:16,757
Because i'm always
gonna be fat.

388
00:15:16,792 --> 00:15:19,828
I don't wanna eat no sweets,
but i can't control myself

389
00:15:19,863 --> 00:15:22,431
When they're right
in front of me like this.

390
00:15:24,166 --> 00:15:25,467
All my life
i've been fat.

391
00:15:25,901 --> 00:15:29,371
I've been to seven camps and i swore
to my mama that i'd lose the weight.

392
00:15:29,406 --> 00:15:33,275
I want to, but i can't
help myself.

393
00:15:33,310 --> 00:15:35,843
Hey, chad.

394
00:15:35,878 --> 00:15:37,613
You know what
you need.

395
00:15:37,648 --> 00:15:38,914
You need a friend.

396
00:15:38,949 --> 00:15:40,215
I do?

397
00:15:40,649 --> 00:15:43,252
Yes,
a chocolate friend.

398
00:15:43,686 --> 00:15:46,288
Mr. Candy bar doesn't
judge you, chad.

399
00:15:46,722 --> 00:15:48,891
Mr. Candy bar likes you
just the way you are.

400
00:15:48,926 --> 00:15:51,927
Look at how yummy
and sweet he is.

401
00:15:55,831 --> 00:15:57,531
There you go.

402
00:15:57,566 --> 00:16:00,169
That'll just be
four dollars.

403
00:16:03,639 --> 00:16:04,940
There you go.

404
00:16:05,374 --> 00:16:06,241
This week on pay-Per-View.

405
00:16:06,675 --> 00:16:08,410
Krazy kenny will crawl up
into a woman's uterus-

406
00:16:08,445 --> 00:16:10,145
And stay there
for six hours.

407
00:16:10,579 --> 00:16:11,880
Don't miss this
once-In-A-Lifetime event.

408
00:16:11,915 --> 00:16:14,049
Order now!

409
00:16:14,483 --> 00:16:17,086
All right, so we're back talking
to three competing celebrities.

410
00:16:17,121 --> 00:16:19,254
Tom green, johnny knoxville
frommtv's"jackass"

411
00:16:19,289 --> 00:16:21,822
And krazy kenny.
Hey, howard.

412
00:16:21,857 --> 00:16:23,592
Krazy kenny is here to promote
his pay-Per-View special this week,

413
00:16:23,627 --> 00:16:27,062
Where he will crawl up
into a bus driver's uterus

414
00:16:27,097 --> 00:16:28,797
And stay there
for six hours.

415
00:16:28,832 --> 00:16:30,497
Wow.

416
00:16:30,532 --> 00:16:31,799
Now, some people think
that all you guys do

417
00:16:31,834 --> 00:16:34,436
Is perform sick and disgusting
acts for shock value and money,

418
00:16:34,471 --> 00:16:35,703
Which makes you whores.

419
00:16:35,738 --> 00:16:37,039
But i'd like to
prove them wrong.

420
00:16:37,074 --> 00:16:38,305
So what i'm gonna do,

421
00:16:38,340 --> 00:16:40,509
Is i'm gonna offer
each of you $50,000

422
00:16:40,544 --> 00:16:42,678
To give me
oral sex right now.

423
00:16:42,713 --> 00:16:43,979
I'm in.
And me! Me too.

424
00:16:44,413 --> 00:16:44,847
Oh!

425
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:46,148
Fine, i'll do it
for 40 then.

426
00:16:46,183 --> 00:16:47,883
30.
20! 10 bucks.

427
00:16:48,317 --> 00:16:49,618
Ooh, the kid says he'll do it
for 10 bucks.

428
00:16:49,653 --> 00:16:50,884
Dammit, i'm out.
Me too.

429
00:16:50,919 --> 00:16:52,186
I guess he is
the biggest whore.

430
00:16:52,221 --> 00:16:54,823
All right, let's get going then,
can we cut the cameras?

431
00:16:54,858 --> 00:16:57,426
And we're gonna
reach for the sky.

432
00:16:57,461 --> 00:16:58,258
Ah! Ah!

433
00:16:58,293 --> 00:16:59,161
And down
to the ground.

434
00:16:59,196 --> 00:17:00,427
Ehh. Ehh.

435
00:17:00,462 --> 00:17:01,330
And up to the sky!

436
00:17:01,365 --> 00:17:03,030
Ah! Ah!

437
00:17:03,065 --> 00:17:04,583
And down
to the ground.

438
00:17:04,618 --> 00:17:06,227
Please,
mr. Sanders-

439
00:17:06,262 --> 00:17:07,483
No, i have had it.

440
00:17:07,518 --> 00:17:08,669
What's
happening?

441
00:17:08,704 --> 00:17:10,439
Horace's parents want
to take him home.

442
00:17:10,474 --> 00:17:11,705
Oh, but he's not
ready yet.

443
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:13,440
Look at what you've
done to my boy!

444
00:17:13,475 --> 00:17:16,477
You told horace that he was
responsible for his weight.

445
00:17:16,512 --> 00:17:19,548
You made him believe that with exercise
and proper diet he could be thin.

446
00:17:19,583 --> 00:17:21,917
When we told you that
it was his genetics.

447
00:17:22,151 --> 00:17:23,851
They can lose the weight
if they try.

448
00:17:23,886 --> 00:17:26,055
Look at these, kids, they're
not getting any thinner!

449
00:17:26,090 --> 00:17:27,755
Your camp is a fraud.

450
00:17:27,790 --> 00:17:31,260
You need to accept the fact that most
fat people are just genetically fat.

451
00:17:31,295 --> 00:17:33,862
Please, sir, if you
give us one more week-

452
00:17:33,897 --> 00:17:34,730
Your time is up!

453
00:17:35,164 --> 00:17:36,031
Yeah, your time is up.

454
00:17:36,465 --> 00:17:38,200
And i'm going to call
all the other parents

455
00:17:38,235 --> 00:17:39,935
And tell them to come
claim their kids as well.

456
00:17:39,970 --> 00:17:42,104
Your camp was
a waste of time!

457
00:17:42,139 --> 00:17:44,706
But dad, i-
What?

458
00:17:44,741 --> 00:17:47,309
Nothin'.

459
00:17:47,743 --> 00:17:49,478
We're in trouble, rick.

460
00:17:51,213 --> 00:17:53,382
All right, miss crabtree,
is it comfortable enough?

461
00:17:53,417 --> 00:17:55,117
How long have i
gotta sit here?

462
00:17:55,152 --> 00:17:56,383
Six hours.

463
00:17:56,418 --> 00:17:59,888
Hell, i'll do six hours for
the 500 bucks you're paying me.

464
00:17:59,923 --> 00:18:01,623
Great.
You guys, it's kenny!

465
00:18:02,057 --> 00:18:03,358
He's been arrested for
prostitution in new york.

466
00:18:03,393 --> 00:18:04,625
For what?

467
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:06,178
For giving howard stern
a hummer.

468
00:18:06,213 --> 00:18:07,661
What's a hummer?
I don't know!

469
00:18:07,696 --> 00:18:09,865
All i know is kenny's in jail
for at least three months.

470
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:11,600
Three months, but the
pay-Per-View is tomorrow.

471
00:18:11,635 --> 00:18:13,335
I know!

472
00:18:15,504 --> 00:18:17,638
We've worked so hard,
come so close.

473
00:18:17,673 --> 00:18:20,275
Now we'll never see kenny crawl
up into miss crabtree's uterus.

474
00:18:20,310 --> 00:18:22,444
Y'know, maybe we've all
learned something here.

475
00:18:22,878 --> 00:18:25,481
I mean, we set kenny up to further
and further himself each time,

476
00:18:25,914 --> 00:18:27,432
Having to always
outdo himself.

477
00:18:27,467 --> 00:18:28,951
Now he's in jail
for being a whore.

478
00:18:29,384 --> 00:18:33,288
And perhaps, just perhaps,
we are to blame.

479
00:18:33,323 --> 00:18:34,590
All right,
that does it.

480
00:18:35,023 --> 00:18:37,192
This has been bothering
the hell out of me.

481
00:18:37,626 --> 00:18:39,361
I knew it, you're not
cartman at all!

482
00:18:39,795 --> 00:18:40,662
Uh-Oh.

483
00:18:45,434 --> 00:18:48,036
Well, we've seen him do just about
every disgusting thing in the book.

484
00:18:48,470 --> 00:18:49,736
And today,
live on pay-Per-View,

485
00:18:49,771 --> 00:18:53,242
Krazy kenny is going to crawl
into a woman's uterus

486
00:18:53,277 --> 00:18:55,809
For six hours!

487
00:18:55,844 --> 00:18:58,447
Well, miss crabtree,
your cervix has been dilated,

488
00:18:58,482 --> 00:19:00,182
Your womb equipped
with oxygen-

489
00:19:00,217 --> 00:19:01,284
How do you feel?

490
00:19:01,319 --> 00:19:02,351
I feel great.

491
00:19:02,784 --> 00:19:05,821
I haven't had this much attention
paid to my cooch since i was 16!

492
00:19:05,856 --> 00:19:07,122
Hooray!

493
00:19:07,556 --> 00:19:09,291
Well, let's bring out
the man of the hour.

494
00:19:09,326 --> 00:19:10,557
You know him as the-

495
00:19:10,592 --> 00:19:12,327
Don't worry, dude,
you're gonna do great.

496
00:19:12,362 --> 00:19:13,629
No way,
i'm not doing this.

497
00:19:13,664 --> 00:19:14,895
Oh, you're doing it,

498
00:19:14,930 --> 00:19:16,665
Or else we're gonna bust your
whole scheme wide open

499
00:19:17,099 --> 00:19:19,268
And tell your mom you haven't actually
been at your drug rehab this whole time.

500
00:19:19,303 --> 00:19:20,702
But this isn't fair!

501
00:19:20,737 --> 00:19:21,870
Deal, druggie.

502
00:19:23,605 --> 00:19:26,208
And here he is,
kenny mckormick!

503
00:19:32,714 --> 00:19:34,883
We can watch him
on the video monitors.

504
00:19:34,918 --> 00:19:37,052
How are you doing
in there, kenny?

505
00:19:37,486 --> 00:19:39,221
That's my boy.

506
00:19:40,522 --> 00:19:41,355
Good-Bye, chad.

507
00:19:41,390 --> 00:19:43,125
We'll be wanting
a refund, naturally.

508
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:44,391
Naturally.

509
00:19:44,426 --> 00:19:45,727
Good-Bye,
alice.

510
00:19:45,762 --> 00:19:47,029
Good-Bye, thank you.

511
00:19:47,462 --> 00:19:48,330
Oh, don't thank us.

512
00:19:48,365 --> 00:19:49,649
We failed you.

513
00:19:49,684 --> 00:19:50,933
...65, 66, 67...

514
00:19:51,366 --> 00:19:53,535
Wait a second,
this isn't right.

515
00:19:53,969 --> 00:19:55,235
Hmm?

516
00:19:55,270 --> 00:19:57,872
It's time for me to be
responsible for my own actions.

517
00:19:57,907 --> 00:20:00,475
Mom, dad, we've been eating
candy this whole time.

518
00:20:00,510 --> 00:20:02,644
Eric cartman's been
sneaking in junk food.

519
00:20:02,679 --> 00:20:04,379
Eh, shut up,
you hef, chad.

520
00:20:04,813 --> 00:20:06,079
No, he's right.

521
00:20:06,114 --> 00:20:07,849
The counselors been
doing a good time,

522
00:20:07,884 --> 00:20:09,983
We've just been
yeah! Cheating.

523
00:20:10,018 --> 00:20:12,621
I believe i can lose the weight
with exercise and proper diet.

524
00:20:12,656 --> 00:20:14,356
I don't want to make
excuses no more.

525
00:20:14,391 --> 00:20:15,224
Me neither!

526
00:20:15,657 --> 00:20:16,924
Yeah!

527
00:20:16,959 --> 00:20:19,127
If you take us back,
we promise we won't cheat.

528
00:20:19,162 --> 00:20:20,862
Well, it's all right
with me.

529
00:20:20,897 --> 00:20:22,164
Parents?

530
00:20:22,598 --> 00:20:23,899
Well, what the heck.

531
00:20:24,333 --> 00:20:27,369
Maybe when you're all done you can
teach me a thing or two, huh, son?

532
00:20:27,404 --> 00:20:29,104
Y'know,
you guys are right.

533
00:20:29,538 --> 00:20:31,273
I'm sick of being
the fat kid too.

534
00:20:31,707 --> 00:20:33,840
I've been making
excuses all my life,

535
00:20:33,875 --> 00:20:37,346
But i know deep down that if i took
responsibility and really tried hard,

536
00:20:37,381 --> 00:20:40,382
If we all try together,
we really can lose the weight!

537
00:20:40,417 --> 00:20:42,985
Oh no, not you, you're not
welcome here anymore.

538
00:20:43,151 --> 00:20:43,852
Yeah! Yeah!

539
00:20:44,286 --> 00:20:45,370
What?

540
00:20:45,405 --> 00:20:46,455
Buh-Bye.

541
00:20:48,190 --> 00:20:49,925
Screw you, fat asses!

542
00:20:55,564 --> 00:20:58,166
4, 3, 2, 1!

543
00:20:58,600 --> 00:20:59,433
He did it!

544
00:20:59,468 --> 00:21:01,602
Come on out,
kenny.

545
00:21:01,637 --> 00:21:04,204
You made it six hours, kenny,
come on out of there.

546
00:21:04,239 --> 00:21:08,143
Hmm, uh, miss crabtree, maybe
you could give him a little push.

547
00:21:08,178 --> 00:21:10,746
Nnnn... gah.

548
00:21:10,781 --> 00:21:13,313
Ohhh!

549
00:21:13,348 --> 00:21:16,385
He's dead, the pressure
must have killed him.

550
00:21:16,818 --> 00:21:19,421
I told you i was
a tight virgin flower.

551
00:21:19,456 --> 00:21:21,156
Oh my god,
they killed kenny!

552
00:21:21,191 --> 00:21:22,024
Sort of.

553
00:21:22,457 --> 00:21:24,626
Yeah, they kind of killed
kenny's... look-Alike.

554
00:21:24,661 --> 00:21:26,326
You bastards!

555
00:21:26,361 --> 00:21:28,313
Well, he gave his life
for our amusement.

556
00:21:28,348 --> 00:21:30,265
One little boy who dared
to be different.

557
00:21:30,699 --> 00:21:33,302
Let us never forget,
kenny mckormick.

558
00:21:35,037 --> 00:21:36,737
Who's that?

559
00:21:36,772 --> 00:21:38,940
? A prostitute is someone
who will love you?

560
00:21:39,374 --> 00:21:42,844
? No matter who you are
or what you look like?

561
00:21:43,278 --> 00:21:45,846
Yes, it's true children.

562
00:21:45,881 --> 00:21:47,833
? That's not why
you pay a prostitute?

563
00:21:47,868 --> 00:21:50,127
? No, you don't pay
for her to stay?

564
00:21:50,162 --> 00:21:52,352
? You're paying her
to leave afterward?

565
00:21:52,387 --> 00:21:54,773
? That's why i praise the lord
for prostitute?
