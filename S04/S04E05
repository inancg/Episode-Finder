00:00:15,650 --> 00:00:16,483
? Going down
to south park?

7
00:00:16,916 --> 00:00:18,651

i can't unwind?

Okay stan, i'm going
to give you...

15
00:00:36,704 --> 00:00:38,422
A "u.F.O.
Crash-Landing" card,

16
00:00:38,457 --> 00:00:40,140
You can deny it
or cover it up.

17
00:00:40,573 --> 00:00:41,840
Dude, i don't understand
this gameat all.

18
00:00:41,875 --> 00:00:44,044
It's "investigative reports
of bill curtis fun time game",

19
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:45,779
You have to deny it
or cover it up.

20
00:00:45,814 --> 00:00:46,646
Uh, deny it.

21
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:48,148
Okay, let's see
what bill curtis says.

22
00:00:48,381 --> 00:00:49,249
Hello, i'm bill curtis.

23
00:00:49,682 --> 00:00:50,984
Many believe that
the u. S. Government

24
00:00:51,418 --> 00:00:53,118
Covered it up,
i'm bill curtis.

25
00:00:53,153 --> 00:00:55,321
All right, cartman,
i'm going to give you...

26
00:00:55,356 --> 00:00:57,057
A "jail time card",
you lose a turn.

27
00:00:57,092 --> 00:00:58,323
Sweet.

28
00:00:58,358 --> 00:01:00,527
Oh yeah, well, i'm
going to give you...

29
00:01:00,562 --> 00:01:01,845
Aids.

30
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:03,094
What?

31
00:01:03,129 --> 00:01:04,829
I just gave
aids? You aids.

32
00:01:04,864 --> 00:01:06,331
Dude, that's not cool,
don't give kyle aids.

33
00:01:06,366 --> 00:01:09,601
Kyle has aids and now loses
47 turns and 800 points.

34
00:01:09,636 --> 00:01:12,238
Kenny, your dad and i are
thinking about having another baby.

35
00:01:12,273 --> 00:01:13,973
Wouldn't you love to have
another brother or sister?

36
00:01:14,407 --> 00:01:15,240
No.

37
00:01:15,275 --> 00:01:18,311
We just might
work on it later tonight.

38
00:01:18,346 --> 00:01:19,577
Goddammit,
poor people suck!

39
00:01:19,612 --> 00:01:20,879
Your family is
already on welfare

40
00:01:20,914 --> 00:01:22,649
And now you're going to bring
another kid into the world.

41
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:25,251
Poor people are churning out
babies, adding on to over-Population

42
00:01:25,286 --> 00:01:27,220
And expectingmeto pay
for it with my tax dollars.

43
00:01:27,255 --> 00:01:29,120
You don't pay tax dollars,
cartman, you're 8.

44
00:01:29,155 --> 00:01:32,157
You see, this is just
what i've been talking about!

45
00:01:32,192 --> 00:01:35,228
I can't even relate to you guys
anymore because you're too immature.

46
00:01:35,263 --> 00:01:36,529
What?
Hanging out with friends

47
00:01:36,963 --> 00:01:38,698
That are a little more
intelligent and understand

48
00:01:39,132 --> 00:01:39,999
Politics and stuff.

49
00:01:40,433 --> 00:01:42,168
It's just that i'm up
on this level, up here

50
00:01:42,203 --> 00:01:43,435
And all my friends
are down here.

51
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:44,771
You don't know what you're
talking about, fat ass!

52
00:01:44,806 --> 00:01:47,373
No, no, no,
me, "nah", you guys, "nah".

53
00:01:47,408 --> 00:01:50,861
Maybe more down,
down "nah".

54
00:01:50,896 --> 00:01:54,314
Screw you guys,
i'm going home!

55
00:01:55,181 --> 00:01:57,350
I'm bill curtis.

56
00:01:58,218 --> 00:01:59,085
I've outgrown
all my friends,

57
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:01,254
I need to meet more
mature people, cloud frog.

58
00:02:01,289 --> 00:02:03,822
Oh, great idea,
cloud frog!

59
00:02:03,857 --> 00:02:06,459
I can meet new friends
on the internet.

60
00:02:06,494 --> 00:02:08,593
Here's a chat room.

61
00:02:08,628 --> 00:02:12,098
"Men who like young boys",
that's perfect!

62
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:22,509
Wow, look at all these guys
that want to be my friends!

63
00:02:22,544 --> 00:02:25,111
I'll pick tony316.

64
00:02:25,545 --> 00:02:28,113
Hi, tony.

65
00:02:28,148 --> 00:02:30,750
Oh, you know
the usual stuff.

66
00:02:30,785 --> 00:02:32,485
Smiley face.

67
00:02:32,919 --> 00:02:35,088
Kewl, wanna get together?
Smiley face.

68
00:02:35,123 --> 00:02:37,690
Sure, tony,
that would be cool.

69
00:02:38,124 --> 00:02:40,293
Winking smiley face.

70
00:02:43,329 --> 00:02:45,064
Sounds good,
see you then!

71
00:02:45,498 --> 00:02:47,667
Clown hat, curly hair,
smiley face.

72
00:02:47,702 --> 00:02:49,402
You see that
cloud frog!

73
00:02:49,836 --> 00:02:52,872
Tomorrow i'm going to meet
my first mature friend.

74
00:02:54,607 --> 00:02:55,874
Hi, are you tony?

75
00:02:55,909 --> 00:02:57,175
Yeah, you're eric?
Yeah!

76
00:02:57,210 --> 00:02:59,812
I brought you some candy. Wow, cool!

77
00:02:59,847 --> 00:03:03,248
And some books
on kama sutra.

78
00:03:03,283 --> 00:03:05,850
Neato, having older friends kicks ass!

79
00:03:05,885 --> 00:03:08,054
You see i've really
been having a tough time,

80
00:03:08,488 --> 00:03:10,223
I've kind of matured faster
than my other friends,

81
00:03:10,258 --> 00:03:11,489
We don't really
relate anymore and -

82
00:03:11,524 --> 00:03:14,994
Uh, all my friends seem
so childish now, you know.

83
00:03:15,029 --> 00:03:17,397
Do you like having
your back rubbed?

84
00:03:17,432 --> 00:03:19,766
Yeah, that seems
really nice, thanks.

85
00:03:19,801 --> 00:03:21,935
Hold it right
there, scum bag!

86
00:03:21,970 --> 00:03:22,802
Huh?

87
00:03:23,236 --> 00:03:24,537
We monitored your little
"on-Line chat",

88
00:03:24,572 --> 00:03:26,272
Now you're coming with us. No!

89
00:03:26,706 --> 00:03:28,441
What the hell
just happened?

90
00:03:31,911 --> 00:03:34,479
You can't eat kenny, we have
to save food for the baby.

91
00:03:34,514 --> 00:03:37,550
Your mom and i are going out for a few
weeks, kenny, take care of the baby.

92
00:03:37,585 --> 00:03:39,403
Kenny, you have to change
the baby's diapers!

93
00:03:39,438 --> 00:03:41,221
You have to share
your room with the baby!

94
00:03:41,256 --> 00:03:42,755
The baby, the baby,
the baby!

95
00:03:42,790 --> 00:03:44,455
Huuuh!

96
00:03:44,490 --> 00:03:46,858
Stop it.

97
00:03:46,893 --> 00:03:48,828
Come on, let's go try to
get you pregnant again.

98
00:03:48,863 --> 00:03:50,094
Oh, all right.

99
00:03:50,129 --> 00:03:51,431
Dad, i want
to play catch.

100
00:03:51,466 --> 00:03:52,298
Huh?

101
00:03:52,732 --> 00:03:53,166
Oh, i'll play catch
with you later, son.

102
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:54,866
I want to play now!

103
00:03:54,901 --> 00:03:57,070
Oh, go ahead, we can
make love afterwards.

104
00:03:57,105 --> 00:03:58,336
Oh, all right.

105
00:03:58,371 --> 00:04:02,709
All right, here comes a pop
fly, see if you can catch it.

106
00:04:03,142 --> 00:04:05,745
Good job,
now throw me one.

107
00:04:06,179 --> 00:04:07,914
Oh!

108
00:04:10,516 --> 00:04:11,783
Blech!

109
00:04:11,818 --> 00:04:13,084
What happened?

110
00:04:13,119 --> 00:04:14,854
He smacked me
in the balls.

111
00:04:14,889 --> 00:04:16,589
Oh, oh!
Woo-Hoo!

112
00:04:16,624 --> 00:04:17,855
Blech!

113
00:04:17,890 --> 00:04:20,927
Okay, we'll
try this again.

114
00:04:27,433 --> 00:04:29,802
This one looks good,
"hung daddy".

115
00:04:29,837 --> 00:04:32,205
Hello, hung daddy!

116
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:35,675
Damn dude, this guy is tiny,
he must be a dwarf.

117
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:38,278
Sorry, i'm not interested in
being friends with midgets.

118
00:04:38,711 --> 00:04:40,880
Frowny face.

119
00:04:42,181 --> 00:04:43,916
How about this one?

120
00:04:45,652 --> 00:04:46,519
Mr. Hammer head?

121
00:04:46,554 --> 00:04:47,785
Hi, there.

122
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:49,520
Mr. Garrison!
Ahh, eric!

123
00:04:49,555 --> 00:04:51,256
You want to be my friend? Oh, crap!

124
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:53,026
That's cool, we can hang out,
what do you want to do first?

125
00:04:53,459 --> 00:04:54,327
Nothing, nothing!

126
00:04:54,761 --> 00:04:56,062
All right, scum bag,
we got you.

127
00:04:56,097 --> 00:04:57,762
Hey, ah!

128
00:04:57,797 --> 00:04:59,063
Good thing
you guys came.

129
00:04:59,098 --> 00:05:00,833
This little boy was trying
to have his way with me.

130
00:05:01,267 --> 00:05:03,870
Nice try, buddy, we monitored
your little "on-Line chat",

131
00:05:03,905 --> 00:05:05,570
Now you're coming with us. No!

132
00:05:05,605 --> 00:05:08,641
Why the hell does the f.B.I.
Keep arresting all my friends?

133
00:05:08,676 --> 00:05:10,376
This has to be the work
of stan and kyle.

134
00:05:10,411 --> 00:05:12,111
God, i hate
those guys!

135
00:05:13,413 --> 00:05:14,679
See, i told you, dude!

136
00:05:14,714 --> 00:05:15,980
Those are
dialysis machines.

137
00:05:16,015 --> 00:05:18,184
Old people have to hook
themselves into it with a tube

138
00:05:18,219 --> 00:05:19,485
And it sucks all
their body fluids out.

139
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:21,220
Oh, man,
that's terrible!

140
00:05:21,255 --> 00:05:22,053
I know, huh?

141
00:05:22,088 --> 00:05:23,389
Put your mouth against
the glass, like this.

142
00:05:23,823 --> 00:05:24,656
Wah!

143
00:05:24,691 --> 00:05:26,124
Yeah,
haaa!

144
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:27,810
Bleh-Leh-Leh-Leh!

145
00:05:27,845 --> 00:05:29,427
Wha-La-La-La-La!

146
00:05:29,462 --> 00:05:31,631
All right, just what the hell
do you guys think you're doing?

147
00:05:31,666 --> 00:05:32,897
We're making faces
at sick people.

148
00:05:32,932 --> 00:05:34,632
No! I mean what
the hell are you doing?

149
00:05:34,667 --> 00:05:39,005
Why are all my mature adult friends
being mysteriously arrested, huh?

150
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:39,439
We don't know.

151
00:05:39,872 --> 00:05:41,139
I'll tell you why!

152
00:05:41,174 --> 00:05:42,909
Because you guys are jealous and can't
handle the fact that you're immature,

153
00:05:43,343 --> 00:05:45,078
So you started a government
conspiracy against me!

154
00:05:45,113 --> 00:05:46,813
We don't know what you're
talking about, lard butt.

155
00:05:46,848 --> 00:05:48,946
Lard butt, oh,
that's so mature.

156
00:05:48,981 --> 00:05:50,717
God, i guess i was wrong
about you guys, huh?

157
00:05:50,752 --> 00:05:52,018
You're not more
mature than us, cartman.

158
00:05:52,053 --> 00:05:54,187
Yes, i am!

159
00:05:55,922 --> 00:05:58,958
I'm telling you this is all a
terrible mistake, officer barbrady.

160
00:05:58,993 --> 00:06:01,526
Well, the f.B.I said
i have to hold you here,

161
00:06:01,561 --> 00:06:04,163
So that's what i'm going
to do, mr. Complainy-Pants.

162
00:06:04,198 --> 00:06:05,465
Oh!

163
00:06:05,898 --> 00:06:09,369
Do you like having
your back rubbed?

164
00:06:09,802 --> 00:06:10,670
Eat me, pervert.

165
00:06:10,705 --> 00:06:13,272
Okay.

166
00:06:14,574 --> 00:06:16,309
We demand you release
these men at once.

167
00:06:16,344 --> 00:06:17,411
Who are you?

168
00:06:17,446 --> 00:06:18,443
We are "nambla",

169
00:06:18,478 --> 00:06:20,178
The north american man-Boy
love association

170
00:06:20,213 --> 00:06:22,815
And we heard about these
political prisoners you're keeping.

171
00:06:22,850 --> 00:06:24,949
Political prisoners?
No, these are child molesters.

172
00:06:24,984 --> 00:06:28,020
Loving young boys has been around
since the time of the romans, pal.

173
00:06:28,055 --> 00:06:29,287
There's nothing
wrong with it!

174
00:06:29,322 --> 00:06:31,456
We are an organization
dedicated to showing

175
00:06:31,491 --> 00:06:34,527
That sex between a man and a
young boy can be a beautiful thing!

176
00:06:34,562 --> 00:06:35,360
Yeah!
Yeah!

177
00:06:35,395 --> 00:06:37,095
Uh, i don't know
who you are,

178
00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:40,166
But these men aren't going any
where until i hear from the f.B.I.

179
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,552
Hate mongerer!
Hate mongerer!

180
00:06:42,587 --> 00:06:44,469
Hate mongerer, yeah.

181
00:06:44,504 --> 00:06:47,707
Okay, people, i think you'd better
move along before i arrest more of you.

182
00:06:47,742 --> 00:06:49,709
All these men wanted
was to love a young boy,

183
00:06:49,744 --> 00:06:51,444
There is nothing
wrong with love.

184
00:06:51,878 --> 00:06:53,613
I did not want love
from a young boy,

185
00:06:53,648 --> 00:06:54,914
I like men
my own age.

186
00:06:54,949 --> 00:06:56,614
Ah! I mean-

187
00:06:56,649 --> 00:06:58,384
I like women,
what did i say?

188
00:06:58,818 --> 00:06:59,650
Oh god,
i love titties!

189
00:06:59,685 --> 00:07:00,987
You haven't heard
the last of us, officer.

190
00:07:01,421 --> 00:07:03,156
Together we are strong.
Come on, men!

191
00:07:03,589 --> 00:07:05,723
Yeah! Yeah!

192
00:07:05,758 --> 00:07:08,361
Well, they got activists
for everything these days.

193
00:07:09,662 --> 00:07:11,362
I've done it, kevin!

194
00:07:11,397 --> 00:07:15,735
I've successfully gene-Spliced this
chipmunk with a piece of provolone cheese.

195
00:07:16,602 --> 00:07:17,904
Do you know what
this means, kevin?

196
00:07:18,337 --> 00:07:20,072
No more will the world have
to look in two different places

197
00:07:20,506 --> 00:07:22,206
For squirrels and
provolone cheese.

198
00:07:22,241 --> 00:07:23,543
No more will mankind
have to pick-

199
00:07:23,578 --> 00:07:24,809
Who could that be?

200
00:07:24,844 --> 00:07:26,579
Why, it's little
eric cartman.

201
00:07:27,013 --> 00:07:28,314
Doctor mefesto,
i need help.

202
00:07:28,349 --> 00:07:30,049
Of course,
come in.

203
00:07:30,483 --> 00:07:32,652
See, unfortunately, i have
matured faster than all my friends.

204
00:07:32,687 --> 00:07:34,786
I want to hang out with older
friends, but i can't find any.

205
00:07:34,821 --> 00:07:36,989
So i was wondering if you can geneticly
engineer some older friends for me.

206
00:07:37,024 --> 00:07:39,123
Oh, eric, i'm afraid
it's not that simple.

207
00:07:39,158 --> 00:07:41,327
Genetic engineering has
not yet evolved to the state

208
00:07:41,362 --> 00:07:43,027
Where i can just
make people.

209
00:07:43,062 --> 00:07:44,762
Damn it, but i want to
hang out with older guys!

210
00:07:44,797 --> 00:07:48,267
Oh, well,i happen to be a member of
an organization that can help you.

211
00:07:48,302 --> 00:07:50,401
It's called "nambla".
"Nambla"?

212
00:07:50,436 --> 00:07:52,570
Yes, i've been a member
for several years.

213
00:07:52,605 --> 00:07:55,208
I'm sure they'll let you join,
you look about right.

214
00:07:55,243 --> 00:07:57,376
Okay, thanks,
sure. Doctor mefesto!

215
00:07:58,678 --> 00:07:59,944
Fellow members
of "nambla",

216
00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:03,015
As you know, we continue
to be discriminated against.

217
00:08:03,050 --> 00:08:05,583
Recently the f.B.I.
Has started to arrest men

218
00:08:05,618 --> 00:08:07,787
Who are doing nothing more
than than trying to start

219
00:08:08,221 --> 00:08:09,956
A sexual relationship
with a young boy.

220
00:08:09,991 --> 00:08:11,222
Oh!
Oh! Oh!

221
00:08:11,257 --> 00:08:13,860
And now that all ethnic groups,
homosexuals and women

222
00:08:13,895 --> 00:08:15,595
Are protected under
civil rights laws,

223
00:08:15,630 --> 00:08:17,330
We want the same!

224
00:08:17,763 --> 00:08:19,065
Yeah!
Yeah! Yeah!

225
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,101
What we need isproof that young
boys want to be members of "nambla".

226
00:08:22,535 --> 00:08:23,836
That theywant
love from us.

227
00:08:23,871 --> 00:08:26,404
We need a poster child.

228
00:08:26,439 --> 00:08:29,041
To show the world that it is a
beautiful and wonderful thing-

229
00:08:29,475 --> 00:08:30,308
Ooooh...!

230
00:08:30,343 --> 00:08:32,677
Can we help you?

231
00:08:32,712 --> 00:08:34,680
Yes, i'd like to join your
fine organization, is that cool?

232
00:08:35,114 --> 00:08:37,248
You do?
Sure.

233
00:08:37,283 --> 00:08:40,753
Thank you,
thank you, jesus!

234
00:08:40,788 --> 00:08:42,054
Sweet.

235
00:08:45,958 --> 00:08:46,791
Whah!

236
00:08:46,826 --> 00:08:48,526
Bleh!
Bleh!

237
00:08:48,561 --> 00:08:50,261
Le-Le-Le-Le!
Buh!

238
00:08:50,296 --> 00:08:52,899
Well, kenny,
the doctor confirmed it.

239
00:08:52,934 --> 00:08:53,766
I'm pregnant!

240
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,501
You're going to have
a little brother or sister.

241
00:08:57,236 --> 00:08:58,936
Yup, it's for sure.

242
00:08:58,971 --> 00:09:01,140
And he fixed my shattered
left testicle, too.

243
00:09:01,175 --> 00:09:02,406
Don't be out
too late, kenny.

244
00:09:02,441 --> 00:09:04,176
We need to start moving
stuff out of your room.

245
00:09:04,211 --> 00:09:06,145
Wow, your mom's
pregnant, kenny!

246
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:08,865
Yeah, now what are
you going to do?

247
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:11,551
I don't know,
hmm-Hmm-Hmhm-Hm-Hmm.

248
00:09:11,586 --> 00:09:12,652
? Nyah-Nyah-Nyah?

249
00:09:12,687 --> 00:09:13,719
? Nyah-Nyah-Nyah?

250
00:09:14,153 --> 00:09:15,021
? I got
into "nambla"?

251
00:09:15,454 --> 00:09:16,756
? And you guys didn't?

252
00:09:16,956 --> 00:09:18,057
What are you
talking about, fat ass?

253
00:09:18,224 --> 00:09:20,309
Oh, no big deal, i just
found a group called "nambla"

254
00:09:20,344 --> 00:09:22,670
With adult members and
they all think i'm so mature

255
00:09:22,705 --> 00:09:24,962
They wantmeto be their
new poster child, is all.

256
00:09:24,997 --> 00:09:29,335
It looks like i'm finally going to
have mature friends who i can relate to.

257
00:09:29,370 --> 00:09:30,636
? Nyah-Nyah-Nyah
nyah-Nyah-Nyah?

258
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:32,588
? I'm too mature
for you guys?

259
00:09:32,623 --> 00:09:34,106
? Nyah-Nyah-Nyah
nyah-Nyah-Nyah?

260
00:09:36,709 --> 00:09:38,010
Can i help you,
young lady?

261
00:09:39,745 --> 00:09:42,348
Oh, you want "morning after"
abortion pills.

262
00:09:42,383 --> 00:09:44,951
Well, they're right over there. Thanks!

263
00:09:54,927 --> 00:09:56,627
I'm sorry,
young lady,

264
00:09:56,662 --> 00:09:59,699
But i can't sell that to you
without permission from your parents.

265
00:10:02,735 --> 00:10:04,470
Well, all righty then,
cash or charge?

266
00:10:04,505 --> 00:10:05,771
Cool.

267
00:10:17,917 --> 00:10:19,652
Look, mom, i made you
something to drink.

268
00:10:19,687 --> 00:10:21,387
Oh, well, that's
very sweet of you kenny,

269
00:10:21,422 --> 00:10:22,688
You made my favorite
drink for me.

270
00:10:22,723 --> 00:10:23,990
Yeah.

271
00:10:24,423 --> 00:10:27,460
But, unfortunately, now that
i'm pregnant i can't drink.

272
00:10:27,495 --> 00:10:30,496
Well, i could still drink. No, daddy.

273
00:10:32,231 --> 00:10:33,931
Oh, that hits
the spot.

274
00:10:33,966 --> 00:10:37,003
Makes me forget all about
my shattered balls.

275
00:10:38,738 --> 00:10:40,871
What, what's
the matter?

276
00:10:40,906 --> 00:10:43,075
Why don't you go
make me another one of-

277
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:45,643
Oh!

278
00:10:45,678 --> 00:10:46,979
What's the matter?
Uh-Oh!

279
00:10:47,413 --> 00:10:49,148
Oh god, i'm gonna
crap my pants!

280
00:10:49,582 --> 00:10:54,318
Oh, god!

281
00:10:54,353 --> 00:10:55,655
Oh, my balls.

282
00:10:56,088 --> 00:10:57,390
Blech!

283
00:10:59,992 --> 00:11:03,029
Oh, god!

284
00:11:10,836 --> 00:11:12,138
Just a few more
pictures, eric.

285
00:11:12,571 --> 00:11:14,306
You make a perfect
poster child.

286
00:11:14,341 --> 00:11:15,608
Thanks, dude.

287
00:11:18,210 --> 00:11:19,910
Hey eric, we have
a surprise for you.

288
00:11:19,945 --> 00:11:21,681
We want you to have
a big dinner and dance

289
00:11:21,716 --> 00:11:23,416
Honoring you as
our new poster child.

290
00:11:23,849 --> 00:11:24,682
Really, awesome!

291
00:11:24,717 --> 00:11:27,319
Yes, and we want you
to, umm...

292
00:11:27,354 --> 00:11:29,922
Invite all your
young male friends.

293
00:11:29,957 --> 00:11:31,622
Oh, yes.
Aww!

294
00:11:31,657 --> 00:11:33,826
Well, sure, i have some
friends who want to be mature

295
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:35,960
Excluding stan and kyle,
of course.

296
00:11:35,995 --> 00:11:37,730
Great, now you go and
invite your little friends

297
00:11:38,164 --> 00:11:39,465
And we'll get
the hotel ready.

298
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:41,634
Kickass!

299
00:11:43,369 --> 00:11:45,104
Kenny, don't forget
to clean out your room,

300
00:11:45,139 --> 00:11:47,672
So we can paint it
for the baby!

301
00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:50,092
Hey, are you feeling down,
you need some excitement!

302
00:11:50,127 --> 00:11:52,478
And north park funland has
just opened its newest ride,

303
00:11:52,513 --> 00:11:53,744
"The john denver experience"!

304
00:11:53,779 --> 00:11:55,948
You'll be "rocky
mountain high" with this,

305
00:11:56,382 --> 00:11:58,551
The most extreme,
insane ride ever built!

306
00:11:58,586 --> 00:12:00,251
It was fun.

307
00:12:00,286 --> 00:12:03,322
Note: people with heart
conditions and expectant mothers

308
00:12:03,357 --> 00:12:06,358
Should not ride "the john
denver", open now, come on down!

309
00:12:06,393 --> 00:12:07,660
Mom!

310
00:12:10,696 --> 00:12:12,431
Are you sure you should be
going on this thing.

311
00:12:12,466 --> 00:12:14,131
Oh, it's all right.

312
00:12:14,166 --> 00:12:16,769
You know, i think kenny's been
a little worried about the baby,

313
00:12:16,804 --> 00:12:19,371
We have to show him that
he's still our little boy.

314
00:12:28,914 --> 00:12:30,649
What'd he say?

315
00:12:38,457 --> 00:12:40,192
Whoa!

316
00:12:49,735 --> 00:12:51,435
Oh god, my nose,
i think i broke my nose.

317
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:53,205
Come on stuart, let's just
get you to a bathroom.

318
00:12:53,639 --> 00:12:54,940
Oh, i'm not going to make it,
i'm going to be sick.

319
00:12:54,975 --> 00:12:58,410
Oh, my stomach.

320
00:13:00,146 --> 00:13:00,579
Oh, my nose.

321
00:13:01,013 --> 00:13:02,314
Gross.

322
00:13:10,122 --> 00:13:11,822
Oh, stan and kyle, just
the guys i wanted to see,

323
00:13:11,857 --> 00:13:14,460
My "nambla" organization is having
a very important benefit in my honor.

324
00:13:14,495 --> 00:13:16,160
They are?

325
00:13:16,195 --> 00:13:18,364
We're going to have a big
mature party at this hotel

326
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:20,533
And i can invite all
my mature friends that i want.

327
00:13:20,568 --> 00:13:22,268
And that means i'm going
to invite everybody,

328
00:13:22,701 --> 00:13:24,436
Except for
you guys!

329
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:27,039
? Nyah-Nyah-Nyah
nyah-Nyah-Nyah?

330
00:13:27,473 --> 00:13:29,208
We don't want to go to some
stupid adult meeting anyway.

331
00:13:29,243 --> 00:13:30,509
Well, that's nice,
because you can't go.

332
00:13:30,544 --> 00:13:31,377
We don't
want to go.

333
00:13:31,811 --> 00:13:32,643
You can't go.

334
00:13:32,678 --> 00:13:33,546
We don'twant
to go.

335
00:13:33,979 --> 00:13:35,246
No, youcan'tgo.

336
00:13:35,281 --> 00:13:38,282
Hey clyde, butters,

337
00:13:38,317 --> 00:13:40,451
Dude, maybe wedoneed to
start being more mature.

338
00:13:40,486 --> 00:13:43,088
Yeah, i guess we've got to
try to get in that club, too.

339
00:13:46,992 --> 00:13:48,294
You're doing fine,
ms. Mccormick.

340
00:13:48,329 --> 00:13:49,994
It's all right, kenny.

341
00:13:50,029 --> 00:13:51,330
Come see
the miracle of life.

342
00:13:51,365 --> 00:13:53,030
Ewww!

343
00:13:53,065 --> 00:13:54,366
I can see his head.
You can?

344
00:13:54,401 --> 00:13:55,668
Push now,
push hard!

345
00:13:57,837 --> 00:13:58,704
Oh, my god!

346
00:14:00,005 --> 00:14:00,873
What is it!

347
00:14:01,307 --> 00:14:03,909
It's alive!

348
00:14:06,946 --> 00:14:08,681
Oh, my god!
It killed kenny!

349
00:14:09,114 --> 00:14:10,850
Bad baby, bad!

350
00:14:10,885 --> 00:14:12,983
Hmm?

351
00:14:13,018 --> 00:14:15,621
That does it!

352
00:14:19,525 --> 00:14:21,694
Oh, hi kenny,
what are you doing?

353
00:14:23,429 --> 00:14:26,031
What are you
doing kenny?

354
00:14:27,333 --> 00:14:29,635
Kenny, what are you
going to plunge?

355
00:14:29,670 --> 00:14:31,670
Grrrrr!

356
00:14:32,104 --> 00:14:32,972
Ahhhh!

357
00:14:33,405 --> 00:14:34,273
Kenny, what the
hell are you doing?

358
00:14:45,117 --> 00:14:46,383
What the hell?

359
00:14:46,418 --> 00:14:47,720
Hey, what the hell
are you guys doing here?

360
00:14:48,153 --> 00:14:49,021
This is for
mature people only.

361
00:14:49,455 --> 00:14:50,721
We got invited too,
fat ass.

362
00:14:50,756 --> 00:14:53,359
Well, i guess nowadays they allow
any old schmucks into "nambla".

363
00:14:53,394 --> 00:14:55,059
Fellow nambla members,

364
00:14:55,094 --> 00:14:56,794
It is great to see
you all here.

365
00:14:56,829 --> 00:14:59,431
It seems like we have finally
found a city that won't oppress us!

366
00:14:59,466 --> 00:15:01,131
Yeah!
Yeah! Yeah!

367
00:15:01,166 --> 00:15:04,202
First and foremost, i want
to recognize eric cartman

368
00:15:04,237 --> 00:15:07,239
For putting us in touch with
all you pretty young boys.

369
00:15:07,274 --> 00:15:08,939
Thank you,
thank you very much.

370
00:15:08,974 --> 00:15:12,227
Now, i know that many of us have
already found partners in this fine city

371
00:15:12,262 --> 00:15:15,481
And i'd like to take a minute to
hear some testimonials from members.

372
00:15:15,516 --> 00:15:16,747
This is boring.
Yeah.

373
00:15:16,782 --> 00:15:18,517
Hey, when are we going to
get to some action, huh?

374
00:15:18,552 --> 00:15:21,085
Oooh!
Ha-Ha!

375
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,421
Goodness,
what a gift from god.

376
00:15:22,855 --> 00:15:24,989
We'll get to it very soon,
i'll assure you.

377
00:15:25,024 --> 00:15:28,060
But first, i'd just like to hear
from a couple of you on your progress.

378
00:15:28,095 --> 00:15:29,326
Yes, patrick.

379
00:15:29,361 --> 00:15:32,831
I found a little 8-Year-Old
named butters,

380
00:15:32,866 --> 00:15:34,566
He's a beautiful
bright little boy.

381
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,700
Well, i sure am,
i guess.

382
00:15:36,735 --> 00:15:39,338
And his skin is as soft
as fresh linen.

383
00:15:39,772 --> 00:15:41,038
Ooh!
Ooh! Ooh!

384
00:15:41,073 --> 00:15:42,339
That seems
kind of weird.

385
00:15:42,374 --> 00:15:44,543
Well, my skin is
"springtime" soft, i suppose.

386
00:15:44,977 --> 00:15:45,809
Wonderful.

387
00:15:45,844 --> 00:15:47,544
And how about you
mr. Harris?

388
00:15:47,579 --> 00:15:51,050
Well, i want to announce that i may
have found the dream boy of the decade,

389
00:15:51,085 --> 00:15:53,652
He's sexy, sassy
and full of spark.

390
00:15:53,687 --> 00:15:55,404
His name is timmy.

391
00:15:55,439 --> 00:15:57,087
Timmy!
Tim-My?

392
00:15:57,122 --> 00:15:59,291
Well, members, i know
we're all eager

393
00:15:59,326 --> 00:16:01,425
To get acquainted with
our new partners.

394
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:04,930
So why don't we turn down
the lights and start the dance.

395
00:16:10,569 --> 00:16:12,738
All right, i want these perverted
bastards all taken in, got it?

396
00:16:12,773 --> 00:16:14,004
Got it!

397
00:16:14,039 --> 00:16:15,306
Fellow nambla members,

398
00:16:15,341 --> 00:16:16,859
As the south park
representative-

399
00:16:16,894 --> 00:16:18,377
Hold it right there!
Nobody move!

400
00:16:18,412 --> 00:16:19,643
What's going on?

401
00:16:19,678 --> 00:16:21,847
All right, sickos,
where are the children?

402
00:16:21,882 --> 00:16:22,715
What children?

403
00:16:23,148 --> 00:16:24,883
This is "nambla",
yes. Right?

404
00:16:25,317 --> 00:16:27,486
"The north american
man-Boy love association".

405
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:28,787
What? No!

406
00:16:29,221 --> 00:16:33,125
We're "the north american
marlon brando look-A-Likes."

407
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:34,877
Oh crap, we've got
the wrong "nambla".

408
00:16:34,912 --> 00:16:36,560
Oh, damn it, i'm
in the wrong place!

409
00:16:36,595 --> 00:16:39,198
Don't tell me that other "nambla"
is actually in south park.

410
00:16:39,233 --> 00:16:40,898
You know of them?

411
00:16:40,933 --> 00:16:44,403
We've been fighting with them for
years over the rights to "nambla.Com".

412
00:16:44,438 --> 00:16:46,103
Yeah, those
perverted bastards!

413
00:16:46,138 --> 00:16:49,174
Wow, you guys really dolook
a lot like marlon brando.

414
00:16:49,209 --> 00:16:50,042
Thank you.

415
00:16:50,476 --> 00:16:51,777
Now, let's go get those
other "nambla" bastards

416
00:16:51,812 --> 00:16:53,512
Before they hurt any
south park children!

417
00:16:53,547 --> 00:16:54,813
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

418
00:16:55,247 --> 00:16:57,416
And let's kick their asses
for stealing our domain name!

419
00:16:57,451 --> 00:16:59,585
Yeah!
Yeah! Yeah!

420
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:03,454
All right, members,
that's enough of that.

421
00:17:03,489 --> 00:17:06,091
It's time for for us all to
retire to our respective rooms

422
00:17:06,126 --> 00:17:08,260
And get to know
our new young boys.

423
00:17:08,295 --> 00:17:09,526
All right!

424
00:17:09,561 --> 00:17:11,730
Dude, being mature is boring. Yeah!

425
00:17:12,164 --> 00:17:16,935
Everyone come up and grab your
room keys and we'll head upstairs.

426
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:25,142
Ahhh!
Ahhh! Ahahhh!

427
00:17:25,177 --> 00:17:29,081
Dude, i think these guys mean to
have sexual encounters with us!

428
00:17:29,515 --> 00:17:31,683
I know dude, let's get
the hell out of here!

429
00:17:32,117 --> 00:17:33,852
Ah! There's more
of them, quick hide!

430
00:17:36,455 --> 00:17:38,155
Okay, marlon brandos!

431
00:17:38,190 --> 00:17:40,359
They've got to be here
somewhere, let's try this room.

432
00:17:41,226 --> 00:17:42,528
Let's get those perverts.

433
00:17:43,829 --> 00:17:45,130
Ah!

434
00:17:45,564 --> 00:17:46,432
Sacre bleu!

435
00:17:46,865 --> 00:17:47,733
Whoa!

436
00:17:48,167 --> 00:17:49,867
Ahhh!
Ahhh!

437
00:17:49,902 --> 00:17:52,071
Kenny, no! Leave me
alone! Mmm-Hmm-Mmm.

438
00:17:55,107 --> 00:17:55,939
Kenny!

439
00:17:55,974 --> 00:17:58,143
This time i will
not drop the food.

440
00:17:58,178 --> 00:17:59,878
Where are
the boys?

441
00:17:59,913 --> 00:18:02,481
Sacre bleu!

442
00:18:03,782 --> 00:18:05,517
I think the boys
went in here.

443
00:18:05,951 --> 00:18:08,120
Ah!
Timmy!

444
00:18:10,289 --> 00:18:11,156
Maybe the boys
are in here, oh boys!

445
00:18:11,191 --> 00:18:12,458
Ah!

446
00:18:12,891 --> 00:18:15,025
All right, you're
under arrest!

447
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:17,229
No, you've got
the wrong "nambla" again.

448
00:18:17,264 --> 00:18:18,062
Dammit!

449
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:19,832
Hey, we didn't
try that room.

450
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:23,302
Sacre bleu.

451
00:18:23,735 --> 00:18:25,037
Dude, we're
surrounded by perverts.

452
00:18:25,072 --> 00:18:25,904
They're all over
the place.

453
00:18:26,338 --> 00:18:27,171
Timmy!

454
00:18:27,206 --> 00:18:28,073
What are we
going to do?

455
00:18:28,507 --> 00:18:30,025
Well, cartman, you got
everybody into this,

456
00:18:30,060 --> 00:18:31,543
You gotta figure a way
to get everybody out.

457
00:18:31,578 --> 00:18:32,428
Yeah!
Yeah! Yeah!

458
00:18:32,463 --> 00:18:33,243
Uhh, that's fine.

459
00:18:33,278 --> 00:18:34,146
I know how
to get us out.

460
00:18:34,181 --> 00:18:35,412
How?

461
00:18:35,447 --> 00:18:37,182
Well, look those perverts
aren't going to rest

462
00:18:37,217 --> 00:18:38,917
Until they've made love
to one of us, right?

463
00:18:39,351 --> 00:18:41,954
So somebody is just going
to have to go out there

464
00:18:41,989 --> 00:18:44,556
And take one
for the team.

465
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:48,894
And i think in all fairness,
it should be butters.

466
00:18:48,929 --> 00:18:51,028
Huh, well,
why me?

467
00:18:51,063 --> 00:18:52,329
Are you a team player
or not?

468
00:18:52,364 --> 00:18:54,533
Yeah, sure, i'm
a team player, i guess.

469
00:18:54,967 --> 00:18:56,268
Well, butters, there is
no "i" in team.

470
00:18:56,702 --> 00:18:59,738
You mean you expect me to go out
there and let all those horny old men

471
00:18:59,773 --> 00:19:01,473
Have their way with
my fragile person?

472
00:19:01,508 --> 00:19:03,173
Just what team
is this anyway?

473
00:19:03,208 --> 00:19:04,943
Just go, butters,
we're running out of time.

474
00:19:04,978 --> 00:19:06,245
Oh, all right then.

475
00:19:06,678 --> 00:19:09,246
He's such
a dumb ass.

476
00:19:09,281 --> 00:19:11,016
All right, men,
here i come.

477
00:19:11,450 --> 00:19:13,584
I'm ready to
take one for the team.

478
00:19:13,619 --> 00:19:17,523
Kenny, kenny, i've had
enough of your shenanigins!

479
00:19:17,558 --> 00:19:19,258
Ooh, one of the boys
just came in!

480
00:19:19,293 --> 00:19:20,793
I get him first!

481
00:19:20,828 --> 00:19:22,259
What the-?

482
00:19:22,294 --> 00:19:24,029
Oh no!
Ahhhhh!

483
00:19:27,499 --> 00:19:28,800
Are you all right,
stuart?

484
00:19:29,234 --> 00:19:30,067
Don't touch me.

485
00:19:30,102 --> 00:19:32,669
I've had my nuts broken,
body poisoned

486
00:19:32,704 --> 00:19:36,175
And been made love to in the
ass by 3 dozen 40-Year-Old men.

487
00:19:36,210 --> 00:19:39,645
I just want to go home
and take a hot bath.

488
00:19:40,078 --> 00:19:41,813
We've been after you
for a long time, buddy.

489
00:19:41,848 --> 00:19:42,681
Do you know
your rights?

490
00:19:43,115 --> 00:19:45,067
Rights? Does anybody
know their rights?

491
00:19:45,102 --> 00:19:46,984
You see, i've learned
something today,

492
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:51,790
Our forefathers came to this country
because they believed in an idea.

493
00:19:52,224 --> 00:19:53,525
An idea
called freedom.

494
00:19:53,959 --> 00:19:55,260
They wanted to live
in a place where a group

495
00:19:55,694 --> 00:19:57,394
Couldn't be prosecuted
for their beliefs.

496
00:19:57,429 --> 00:19:59,997
Where a person can live
the way he chooses to live.

497
00:20:00,032 --> 00:20:03,068
You see us as being perverted
because we're different from you.

498
00:20:03,103 --> 00:20:05,636
People are afraid of us
because they don't understand.

499
00:20:05,671 --> 00:20:09,141
And sometimes it's easier to
persecute than to understand.

500
00:20:09,176 --> 00:20:12,177
Dude, you have
sex with children.

501
00:20:12,212 --> 00:20:14,311
We are human.

502
00:20:14,346 --> 00:20:16,949
Most of us didn't evenchooseto
be attracted to young boys,

503
00:20:16,984 --> 00:20:18,649
We were born
that way.

504
00:20:18,684 --> 00:20:20,384
We can't help
the way we are,

505
00:20:20,419 --> 00:20:23,455
And if you all can't
understand that, well,

506
00:20:23,490 --> 00:20:26,491
Then i guess you'll just
have to put us away.

507
00:20:29,962 --> 00:20:33,397
Dude, you have
sexwith children.

508
00:20:33,432 --> 00:20:34,733
Yeah, you know, we believe
in equality for everybody

509
00:20:35,167 --> 00:20:36,034
And all that gay stuff,
but dude,

510
00:20:36,468 --> 00:20:38,168
You.
Seriously.

511
00:20:38,203 --> 00:20:42,541
Alright, that's enough, you're all
going to be put away for a long time.

512
00:20:42,975 --> 00:20:44,241
Well, cartman.
Well, what?

513
00:20:44,276 --> 00:20:46,011
Don't you think you owe everyone an
apology for bringing "nambla" here?

514
00:20:46,445 --> 00:20:46,878
Yeah!
Yeah! Yeah!

515
00:20:47,312 --> 00:20:48,145
All right,
all right.

516
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:49,915
I'm sorry i almost got
you guys all raped, there.

517
00:20:50,349 --> 00:20:52,517
And now do you still think you need
to hang out with older, mature friends?

518
00:20:52,552 --> 00:20:55,120
No, i guess you guys will
blossom into maturity someday,

519
00:20:55,155 --> 00:20:57,289
Just don't
take too long.

520
00:20:57,324 --> 00:20:59,458
Okay, let's roll.

521
00:21:05,097 --> 00:21:06,398
Coo-Coochie-Coo
coo-Coochie-Coo.

522
00:21:06,433 --> 00:21:08,801
Our little angel,
yes.

523
00:21:08,836 --> 00:21:11,134
Oh, he's so beautiful!

524
00:21:11,169 --> 00:21:13,772
I know it's been hard on
both of us, losing poor kenny.

525
00:21:13,807 --> 00:21:15,507
But this knew baby
kinda reminds me of him.

526
00:21:15,941 --> 00:21:17,207
What should
we name him?

527
00:21:17,242 --> 00:21:19,411
Well, seeing as though
kenny passed away,

528
00:21:19,446 --> 00:21:21,146
Maybe we should
name him...

529
00:21:21,181 --> 00:21:21,979
Kenny.

530
00:21:22,014 --> 00:21:24,182
Yes, kenny is such
a great name.

531
00:21:24,616 --> 00:21:26,351
My little kenny,
a brand-New kenny.

532
00:21:27,653 --> 00:21:31,123
God, this must have been the
50th time this has happened.

533
00:21:31,158 --> 00:21:32,424
52nd.
