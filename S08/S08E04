2
00:00:52,048 --> 00:00:54,920
Dude, these little remote-controlled cars are kickass.

3
00:00:54,968 --> 00:00:56,835
Sweet. I made mine go off the jump.

4
00:00:57,058 --> 00:00:59,324
Dude, my car sucks. I gotta get a new one.

5
00:00:59,770 --> 00:01:01,493
Hey, who are those kids?

6
00:01:12,768 --> 00:01:14,555
Yeah, how you like that y'all!

7
00:01:15,592 --> 00:01:17,012
Let's bring it to these losers.

8
00:01:17,171 --> 00:01:18,113
Aww yeah!

13
00:01:36,999 --> 00:01:39,392
Aww man, look at them!
They know they can't trip to that!

14
00:01:39,408 --> 00:01:41,865
-Yeah! We're outta here!
- That was smokin'!

15
00:01:41,897 --> 00:01:45,215
- They didn't do nothin'!
- Sorry y'all, but tru not to let it sting too bad!

16
00:01:45,534 --> 00:01:47,400
You got served!

17
00:01:47,927 --> 00:01:49,969
Come on! They had nothin'! Let's go y'all!

18
00:01:50,001 --> 00:01:51,102
Come on y'all!

19
00:01:52,394 --> 00:01:54,596
...What the hell just happened?

20
00:01:57,630 --> 00:01:59,545
Oh. Hello there, children!

21
00:01:59,576 --> 00:02:01,970
Chef, we just got served.

22
00:02:03,230 --> 00:02:06,756
Oh boy... Well come on inside, children.
I'll make you some cocoa.

23
00:02:07,985 --> 00:02:10,952
Have a seat, children.
Just try to relax and breathe.

24
00:02:10,984 --> 00:02:12,962
- Are you all okay?
- Yeah.

25
00:02:12,994 --> 00:02:16,168
All right. Now, where did you get served?

26
00:02:16,519 --> 00:02:18,099
Over at the True Value parking lot.

27
00:02:18,115 --> 00:02:20,667
There were just these kids we never saw before
showed up and they were like,

28
00:02:20,702 --> 00:02:23,356
really good dancers and, we don't really
understand what it means, but I guess...

29
00:02:23,379 --> 00:02:25,129
Okay okay, relax children.

30
00:02:25,141 --> 00:02:27,372
Relax.
It's all over now.

31
00:02:27,395 --> 00:02:29,438
Just try to calm down and sit tight.

32
00:02:29,450 --> 00:02:32,832
I'm gonna call your parents and let them know you're okay.

33
00:02:34,136 --> 00:02:35,251
Mrs. Marsh?

34
00:02:35,275 --> 00:02:36,625
Hi, it's Chef.

35
00:02:36,637 --> 00:02:38,797
Yeah, I'm good. Listen :

36
00:02:38,832 --> 00:02:41,333
Stan and his friends just got served.

37
00:02:41,556 --> 00:02:42,648
Yeah.

38
00:02:42,671 --> 00:02:44,233
Yeah, over at the True Value.

39
00:02:44,504 --> 00:02:47,217
No no, he's fine.
They're all fine.

40
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:49,025
Yeah, it was some kids from out of town.

41
00:02:49,037 --> 00:02:50,739
Apparently they were pretty good dancers.

42
00:02:50,763 --> 00:02:52,301
They really let 'em have it.

43
00:02:55,562 --> 00:02:59,601
Here, Stanley, I made your favorite potato dish.
I want you to feel better, okay.

44
00:03:00,516 --> 00:03:01,820
What's the matter with him?

45
00:03:01,831 --> 00:03:04,684
Oh. Stan got served at school today.

46
00:03:05,307 --> 00:03:06,915
You got served?
By who?

47
00:03:06,951 --> 00:03:10,332
- Some, kids from Orange County.
- Let's not make a big deal out of it.

48
00:03:10,356 --> 00:03:12,481
So wha- so what'd you do?
D'you dance back?

49
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:13,289
No.

50
00:03:13,291 --> 00:03:15,510
What? Yo-you got served and just
stood there and took it??

51
00:03:15,534 --> 00:03:16,896
That was the right thing to do.

52
00:03:16,908 --> 00:03:18,305
Naw, that's crap, Sharon!

53
00:03:18,333 --> 00:03:20,340
Stanley, when somebody challenges you to dance,

54
00:03:20,354 --> 00:03:22,631
you have to dance back at them,
or else they'll think you're weak.

55
00:03:22,667 --> 00:03:24,357
But Dad, I don't know how to dance or nothin'.

56
00:03:24,375 --> 00:03:25,843
Well then, it's about time you learned!

57
00:03:25,872 --> 00:03:28,115
Put on some loose-fitting clothes
and meet me in the garage!

58
00:03:28,127 --> 00:03:29,747
- But Dad...
- Now !

59
00:03:31,308 --> 00:03:34,008
All right son, dancing is all about a frame of mind.

60
00:03:34,044 --> 00:03:37,002
Now, I'm not telling you to go around
challenging other kids to dance,

61
00:03:37,003 --> 00:03:38,658
but when they challenge you,

62
00:03:38,729 --> 00:03:40,607
you just look 'em straight in the eye,

63
00:03:40,619 --> 00:03:42,028
and give 'em this.

64
00:03:48,761 --> 00:03:49,959
Come on, Stan.

65
00:03:57,073 --> 00:03:58,975
...six, seven, eight.

66
00:04:03,625 --> 00:04:05,457
Dude, that is a sweet RC car.

67
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:07,300
Yeah, let's go race it right now.

68
00:04:07,676 --> 00:04:09,167
Well, what we got here?

69
00:04:09,179 --> 00:04:11,269
It's the white boys that were served yesterday.

70
00:04:13,195 --> 00:04:14,872
You want a little more, homeboys?

71
00:04:14,874 --> 00:04:17,469
- We're not interested, thanks.
- You're not interesetd?

72
00:04:17,492 --> 00:04:19,136
Not interested in this??

73
00:04:26,795 --> 00:04:28,893
Oh Lord, look at those moves.

74
00:04:28,923 --> 00:04:30,795
Oooo, they are takin' it out!

75
00:04:31,454 --> 00:04:33,311
Oh man, they are getting served!

76
00:04:33,326 --> 00:04:35,933
Ooooo, it's getting hot out here!

77
00:04:36,277 --> 00:04:37,401
Have mercih!

78
00:04:38,030 --> 00:04:40,577
- Oooooo, look at that!
- Lord!

79
00:04:40,741 --> 00:04:42,269
Gettin' served!

80
00:05:04,484 --> 00:05:06,295
Yeah! Go Stan!

81
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:07,194
Oh no!

82
00:05:07,254 --> 00:05:09,816
No, stop Stan!
You don't know what you're doin'!

83
00:05:16,272 --> 00:05:17,680
All right Stan!

84
00:05:17,695 --> 00:05:20,571
HA! You just got f'd in the a!

85
00:05:20,586 --> 00:05:23,133
- Wha?
- Yeah! YOU got served!

86
00:05:23,192 --> 00:05:24,238
- Yeah!
- That's right!

87
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,873
- All right!
- No no no!

88
00:05:26,502 --> 00:05:27,504
Okay.

89
00:05:27,506 --> 00:05:29,798
All right. We got served.

90
00:05:30,187 --> 00:05:32,135
So now, I guess...

91
00:05:32,195 --> 00:05:33,813
It's on.

92
00:05:35,131 --> 00:05:35,925
What?

93
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:39,205
This Saturday!
Our top five dancers against your top five dancers!

94
00:05:39,216 --> 00:05:40,911
OC Convention Center. It's on!

95
00:05:40,936 --> 00:05:42,759
It's on! It's on!
It's on! It's on!

96
00:05:42,798 --> 00:05:43,979
Oh Lord it's on!

97
00:05:44,044 --> 00:05:46,624
Oh damnit!
I knew that was gonna happen.

98
00:05:46,650 --> 00:05:48,164
We'll see you Saturday, fools!

99
00:05:48,165 --> 00:05:50,887
Yeah, and you'd better have a lot better dancers with you
than those loozas!

100
00:05:50,913 --> 00:05:53,699
- 'Cause it's on!
- It's on! It's on! It's on! It's on!

101
00:05:56,716 --> 00:05:58,962
Stan, what the hell did you dance back for??

102
00:05:59,066 --> 00:06:00,645
I thought I was supposed to!

103
00:06:00,681 --> 00:06:03,887
Now you've gotta compete against them
in the dance competition on Saturday!

104
00:06:03,921 --> 00:06:05,166
But why??

105
00:06:05,201 --> 00:06:08,548
Because if you get served and served them back,
then it's on!

106
00:06:08,595 --> 00:06:10,262
Don't you know anything??

107
00:06:13,268 --> 00:06:16,979
Well, nice going, Randy!
Really great advice you gave our son here!

108
00:06:17,378 --> 00:06:17,952
What?

109
00:06:17,954 --> 00:06:21,077
Those kids showed up to serve Stan again
and he danced back!

110
00:06:21,171 --> 00:06:23,484
- So what happened?
- It's on!

111
00:06:41,436 --> 00:06:42,986
Come on now, keep it tight!

112
00:06:47,541 --> 00:06:49,890
Good. Now watch that timing, drill team!

113
00:06:53,037 --> 00:06:54,045
- All right!
- All right!

114
00:06:54,047 --> 00:06:56,055
- Yeah, bad ass!
- Yeah, that was tight!

115
00:06:56,090 --> 00:06:57,534
Not bad, kids.
Not bad.

116
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:59,624
Not bad?
South Park doesn't stand a chance!

117
00:06:59,632 --> 00:07:02,178
- I heard that!
- All right, it was good.

118
00:07:02,210 --> 00:07:04,767
But we don't want "good,"
we want pain!

119
00:07:04,803 --> 00:07:06,412
Uh ex, excuse me.

120
00:07:06,470 --> 00:07:07,140
Yeah?

121
00:07:07,186 --> 00:07:10,944
Hi, uh, my name is Randy Marsh.
I'm I'm Stan Marsh's father.

122
00:07:10,979 --> 00:07:15,065
Oh, so you're the father of the boy who's gonna
get f'd in the a on Saturday?

123
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:16,251
Dang!

124
00:07:17,778 --> 00:07:18,811
Uh, listen.

125
00:07:18,834 --> 00:07:22,204
Ih, it was my fault that Stanley
served your boys the other day.

126
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:24,494
Uh, I told him to do it and I...

127
00:07:24,635 --> 00:07:27,288
Weh well look I, I just came down here to tell you...

128
00:07:27,312 --> 00:07:28,615
Ih it's not on.

129
00:07:29,402 --> 00:07:30,670
Oh, it's on!

130
00:07:30,682 --> 00:07:32,255
Nonono, it's not on.

131
00:07:32,326 --> 00:07:33,958
Whoo, it's on all right!

132
00:07:33,981 --> 00:07:36,094
It isn't on.
Nothing's on.

133
00:07:36,106 --> 00:07:38,396
- It's off.
- It's on!

134
00:07:38,454 --> 00:07:42,164
I'm keeping my son home on Saturday.
I just came by to let you know so you can...

135
00:07:42,223 --> 00:07:43,949
put a stup to all this.
Good bye.

136
00:07:45,488 --> 00:07:47,144
Hold on a second, clamhead!

137
00:07:47,168 --> 00:07:50,808
You think you can just roll in here
and tell us it's not on when it very clearly is on?!

138
00:07:50,831 --> 00:07:53,262
You're just trying to make us not practice,
aren't you?!

139
00:07:53,273 --> 00:07:57,042
Because you KNOW that your kids are goin' down
when my kids give them this!

140
00:07:57,054 --> 00:07:58,475
Give me some moves out, Girl T!

141
00:07:59,074 --> 00:08:00,741
Check this out!

142
00:08:03,576 --> 00:08:05,572
- Yeah! You like that?!
- Oooo man!

143
00:08:05,596 --> 00:08:06,970
Ohhh Lord!

144
00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:12,441
Oooo, he is gettin' served!

145
00:08:19,827 --> 00:08:22,305
Randy ?
Randy, oh my God!

146
00:08:22,329 --> 00:08:24,020
What happened to him, Doctor?

147
00:08:24,090 --> 00:08:26,803
He got served.
Worst I've ever seen.

148
00:08:26,838 --> 00:08:30,407
Old fool went down to the OC
to try to reason with the other team,

149
00:08:30,513 --> 00:08:32,603
and he got served up somethin' fierce.

150
00:08:32,626 --> 00:08:34,000
Oh Lord...

151
00:08:34,058 --> 00:08:37,322
His dancing was so fast I...
couldn't do anything.

152
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:40,633
His moves were...
so original, so inventive.

153
00:08:41,572 --> 00:08:43,803
Shh relax, Mr. Marsh.

154
00:08:44,918 --> 00:08:46,973
We just got the X-rays back.

155
00:08:46,996 --> 00:08:49,310
He mostly got served here
and here

156
00:08:49,356 --> 00:08:51,740
But the worst serving was here in the pelvic region.

157
00:08:51,787 --> 00:08:54,053
The road to recovery will be a long one.

158
00:08:54,077 --> 00:08:55,039
Boy.

159
00:08:55,051 --> 00:08:58,290
Boy. You must really wanna take to
to those Orange County kids now, huh Stan?

160
00:08:58,572 --> 00:08:59,465
Are you kiddin'?

161
00:08:59,488 --> 00:09:02,752
Stan is probably ready to pounce on them
after what they did to his father!

162
00:09:03,809 --> 00:09:05,676
I, I don't know.
He seems all right.

163
00:09:05,781 --> 00:09:08,869
I could only imagine the rage building inside you, Stan.

164
00:09:08,904 --> 00:09:12,403
I bet you can't wait to outdance those OC bastards!

165
00:09:15,174 --> 00:09:17,781
- Yeahh I'm I'm right here, Dad.
- Stan, listen to me.

166
00:09:17,886 --> 00:09:21,174
I don't want you feeling like
you have to do that competition now to avenge me.

167
00:09:21,209 --> 00:09:24,250
- Okay, good.
- But I know I can't stop you from doing it.

168
00:09:24,297 --> 00:09:26,163
So all I can say is...

169
00:09:26,164 --> 00:09:27,808
give 'em hell, son.

170
00:09:27,843 --> 00:09:28,853
Give 'em hell.

171
00:09:34,279 --> 00:09:35,579
God damnit!

172
00:09:41,272 --> 00:09:44,272
Hey guys. Uh.
You guys know how to dance, right?

173
00:09:44,322 --> 00:09:45,939
Of course we know how to dance.

174
00:09:45,972 --> 00:09:48,222
Cool, because, there's this competition on Saturday,

175
00:09:48,255 --> 00:09:51,189
and I have to find the very best dancers
in South Park to be on my crew.

176
00:09:51,239 --> 00:09:54,422
My friends can't do it because they suck ass,
so, will you be in my dance troupe?

177
00:09:54,469 --> 00:09:56,302
Dance troupe? Please.

178
00:09:56,336 --> 00:09:59,036
We don't dance like those
Britney and Justin wannabes at school.

179
00:09:59,086 --> 00:10:01,436
Goth kids dance to express pain and suffering.

180
00:10:01,489 --> 00:10:03,971
Yeah The only cool way to dance
is to keep your hands at your sides

181
00:10:03,989 --> 00:10:05,321
and your eyes looking at the ground.

182
00:10:05,322 --> 00:10:07,739
Then every three seconds
you take a drag from your cigarette.

183
00:10:20,543 --> 00:10:22,191
Okay, that'll work fine.
Listen...

184
00:10:22,193 --> 00:10:25,443
there's a dance competition this Saturday
and I need good dancers so I don't get served.

185
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:27,060
No way.

186
00:10:27,077 --> 00:10:29,977
Dancing is something you do alone
in your room at three in the morning.

187
00:10:30,043 --> 00:10:32,060
Please, you guys,
our whole town's reputation is at stake!

188
00:10:32,093 --> 00:10:33,943
- Will any of you do it?
- I'm not doin' it.

189
00:10:33,977 --> 00:10:36,393
Being in a dance group is totally conformist.

190
00:10:36,426 --> 00:10:39,526
Yeah. I'm not conforming
to some dance-off regulations.

191
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:43,610
I'm not doin' it either.
I'm the biggest nonconformist of all.

192
00:10:45,126 --> 00:10:48,593
I'm such a nonconformist
that I'm not going to conform with the rest of you.

193
00:10:48,659 --> 00:10:50,743
- Okay, I'll do it.
- Great!

194
00:10:51,609 --> 00:10:54,241
Whoa.
I think we just got put in our place.

195
00:10:54,243 --> 00:10:56,859
Yeah.
We just got Goth-served.

196
00:10:57,443 --> 00:10:59,326
All right, we gotta find
three other kids that can dance.

197
00:10:59,343 --> 00:11:00,910
We should go to the arcade.

198
00:11:00,943 --> 00:11:01,793
The arcade?

199
00:11:01,829 --> 00:11:03,495
Yeah. There's this Asian kid name Yao.

200
00:11:03,512 --> 00:11:06,112
He's an expert at that
Dance Dance Revolution game.

201
00:11:16,042 --> 00:11:17,142
Dude, he's incredible.

202
00:11:17,159 --> 00:11:19,942
He should be.
He's here playing that game every single day after school.

203
00:11:19,969 --> 00:11:22,802
I think he's spent about
six thousand dollars on it so far.

204
00:11:35,266 --> 00:11:38,616
Hey kid, you're pretty good.
How would you like to join our dance troupe?

205
00:11:38,652 --> 00:11:41,069
You mean, dancing without
a machine telling you what to do?

206
00:11:41,085 --> 00:11:43,785
- Yeah.
- That's stupid.

207
00:11:44,019 --> 00:11:46,752
- Dude, we need you.
- I can't dance without the machine.

208
00:11:46,786 --> 00:11:49,052
It's all right.
My friend Chef is gonna coach us.

209
00:11:49,119 --> 00:11:51,736
- Okay. I'll give it a shot.
- All right, that's three!

210
00:11:51,769 --> 00:11:53,436
- Dude, we need a girl.
- Huh?

211
00:11:53,469 --> 00:11:56,702
We can't be a dance troupe with just guys.
People will think we're fags.

212
00:11:56,719 --> 00:12:00,185
Oh yeah.
Wait a minute. I know just where to go!

213
00:12:06,955 --> 00:12:09,355
Hi guys, welcome to Raisins.
Three of you?

214
00:12:09,388 --> 00:12:11,770
Ah actually we were just hoping
we could talk to you guys real quick.

215
00:12:11,772 --> 00:12:14,605
You have to buy wings
if you wanna talk to the Raisins girls.

216
00:12:16,257 --> 00:12:19,282
And so we're putting all the best dancers
in South Park together to beat Orange County.

217
00:12:19,319 --> 00:12:22,283
Wow, that sounds great.
I always wanted to try my dancing somewhere else.

218
00:12:22,308 --> 00:12:24,141
- So you'll do it?
- Why not?

219
00:12:24,143 --> 00:12:25,770
All right, we just need one more person!

220
00:12:25,795 --> 00:12:28,395
Hey, we should get that kid
that was state champion in tap dancing.

221
00:12:28,419 --> 00:12:31,044
What? The state tap champion is from here?
Who?

222
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:34,202
I think his name was...
Leopold... Stotch or something?

223
00:12:34,263 --> 00:12:37,471
Leopold Stotch...?
Wait a minute. You mean...

224
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:39,087
Loo loo loo, I've got some apples.

225
00:12:39,111 --> 00:12:41,067
Loo loo loo, you've got some too.

226
00:12:41,116 --> 00:12:43,838
- Loo loo loo, I've...
- Butters, you have some visitors.

227
00:12:43,917 --> 00:12:45,412
Oh well hi there everybody.

228
00:12:45,424 --> 00:12:49,057
Butters, listen. There's gonna be a competition
this Saturday, and we want you to join our troupe.

229
00:12:49,081 --> 00:12:50,794
Wow, neato, a competiton?

230
00:12:50,805 --> 00:12:53,525
- Why, I'd love to. What kind of competition is it?
- It's a dance-off.

231
00:12:53,527 --> 00:12:55,969
We heard you were tap dancing state champion
two years ago.

232
00:12:58,871 --> 00:12:59,636
... No

233
00:13:00,694 --> 00:13:03,695
But, you were, weren't you?
Y-you went to the nationals in Nebraska.

234
00:13:03,731 --> 00:13:06,562
No.
No no nono no no, no!

235
00:13:07,949 --> 00:13:11,071
- No no nono no no, no!
- Butters ?

236
00:13:11,083 --> 00:13:12,432
Butters ??

237
00:13:12,719 --> 00:13:15,803
We just asked him to join our dance troupe.
We heard he was state tap champion.

238
00:13:17,098 --> 00:13:18,410
Oh dear.

239
00:13:18,513 --> 00:13:20,612
I'm sorry kids, it's just that...

240
00:13:20,632 --> 00:13:22,750
Butters hasn't danced since the tragedy.

241
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:23,965
A tragedy?

242
00:13:25,856 --> 00:13:27,742
I'm sorry, kids, you'll have to go.

243
00:13:29,469 --> 00:13:31,169
Damnit, where are we gonna get our fifth member?

244
00:13:31,203 --> 00:13:34,019
Hey I heard about this guy in Cuomo
who has a duck that can dance.

245
00:13:34,103 --> 00:13:37,484
A duck? Dude, don't be stupid!
Those OC kids are professional dancers!

246
00:13:37,486 --> 00:13:40,853
Now come on, there's gotta be
one other talneted person in South Park.

247
00:14:18,822 --> 00:14:21,864
- All right, so you're sure he can dance?
- Oh yeah.

248
00:14:21,883 --> 00:14:24,720
There he is. That's Jeffy.

249
00:14:26,904 --> 00:14:28,938
That don't look like a dancing duck to me.

250
00:14:28,957 --> 00:14:32,540
Well, that's 'cause it needs music.
Here y-here ya go, Jeffy.

251
00:14:33,530 --> 00:14:36,870
" You'll do a line and I'll do a line,
honeeey. "

252
00:14:36,907 --> 00:14:39,837
" You'll do a line and I'll do a line,
babe. "

253
00:14:39,875 --> 00:14:43,234
You'll do a line and I'll do a line,
we'll fight an' screw 'til the mornin' time.

254
00:14:43,271 --> 00:14:46,014
Honey, babe, be mine.

255
00:14:46,052 --> 00:14:48,664
You'll do a line and I'll do a line, honey

256
00:14:48,702 --> 00:14:50,699
Ih ih Is that the only song he'll dance to?

257
00:14:50,755 --> 00:14:53,069
No no, he'll dance to anything. See?

258
00:14:53,087 --> 00:14:56,464
You'll snort K and I'll snort K, honeeey.

259
00:14:56,465 --> 00:14:59,151
You'll snort K and I'll snort K, babe.

260
00:14:59,731 --> 00:15:02,362
My friends, I think we have ourselves a dance troupe.

261
00:15:06,561 --> 00:15:10,666
Butters? Butters?
Come on, sweetie, it's gonna be okay.

262
00:15:11,208 --> 00:15:14,529
Come on, Butters.
You went through a lot of therapy for this.

263
00:15:14,548 --> 00:15:17,161
That was almost two years ago, sweetie.

264
00:15:17,571 --> 00:15:18,877
Two years ago.

265
00:15:19,307 --> 00:15:20,781
Two years ago!

266
00:15:25,679 --> 00:15:29,132
That was Beverly Long from Indianapolis, folks.
Let her hear it!

267
00:15:29,169 --> 00:15:31,726
All right, and now, dancing to the song

268
00:15:31,744 --> 00:15:34,469
"I've Got Something In My Front Pocket For You,"

269
00:15:34,507 --> 00:15:36,504
here is Colorado state champion,

270
00:15:36,523 --> 00:15:39,173
Leopold "Butters" Stotch!

271
00:15:42,922 --> 00:15:45,823
I've got something in my front pocket for you

272
00:15:45,824 --> 00:15:49,164
Why don't you reach down in my pocket and see what it is

273
00:15:49,165 --> 00:15:51,889
Then grab onto it, it's just for you

274
00:15:51,890 --> 00:15:54,763
Give a little squeeze and say, "How do you do?"

275
00:15:54,764 --> 00:15:57,674
There's something in my front pocket,
There's something in my front pocket,

276
00:15:57,675 --> 00:15:59,720
There's something in my front pocket-

277
00:16:11,875 --> 00:16:13,890
Paul. Paul!

278
00:16:23,968 --> 00:16:27,291
No! Nooo!
Noooooooooooooooo!

279
00:16:30,837 --> 00:16:32,666
All right, children,
let's get to rehearsin'!

280
00:16:32,684 --> 00:16:35,968
We don't have much time,
and you've got to become the dance group you can be.

281
00:16:36,006 --> 00:16:37,592
I think we should...

282
00:16:37,593 --> 00:16:38,955
Whoa.

283
00:16:42,558 --> 00:16:44,928
This... is the dance troupe?

284
00:16:45,023 --> 00:16:47,654
Yeah, dude, the best dancers South Park has to offer.

285
00:16:48,388 --> 00:16:49,545
Oh boy.

286
00:16:49,564 --> 00:16:51,822
All right, well, why don't you show me what you got?

287
00:16:51,841 --> 00:16:53,875
I wanna see what you kids can do!

288
00:17:10,758 --> 00:17:12,643
Oh Lord have mercy.

289
00:17:12,681 --> 00:17:13,987
Children, children!

290
00:17:14,006 --> 00:17:15,740
No no, you've got it all wrong.

291
00:17:15,741 --> 00:17:17,327
Don't you see, children?

292
00:17:17,328 --> 00:17:20,631
You have the heart, but you don't have the soul.

293
00:17:21,182 --> 00:17:25,792
Nono, wait.
You have the soul, but you don't have the heart.

294
00:17:26,072 --> 00:17:27,640
Nono, scratch that.

295
00:17:27,677 --> 00:17:30,029
You have the heart and the soul,

296
00:17:30,066 --> 00:17:32,213
but you don't have the talent.

297
00:17:33,056 --> 00:17:35,239
We're gonna get served on Saturday, aren't we?

298
00:17:35,422 --> 00:17:37,122
What? I don't wanna get served.

299
00:17:37,139 --> 00:17:39,256
Yeah, you didn't tell us that we might get served.

300
00:17:39,307 --> 00:17:40,599
Well that was the whole point of the whole thing

301
00:17:40,616 --> 00:17:42,988
the guys came back and they said
we were gonna get served and we were like...

302
00:17:43,005 --> 00:17:44,822
All right all right, quiet, children!

303
00:17:44,872 --> 00:17:46,921
Now, nobody's getting served if I can help it.

304
00:17:46,922 --> 00:17:49,071
We just gotta buckle down, dig deep,

305
00:17:49,072 --> 00:17:51,922
and pray that maybe the other team comes down with cancer.

306
00:18:00,205 --> 00:18:01,921
What do you want?

307
00:18:01,951 --> 00:18:05,767
I came to ask you one more time to join the crew.
Everyone is practicing really hard, but...

308
00:18:05,784 --> 00:18:08,101
I don't think we have any kind of shot without you.

309
00:18:08,151 --> 00:18:10,384
Sorry, Stan, I'm not a dancer anymore.

310
00:18:10,418 --> 00:18:11,718
I gave that up.

311
00:18:11,751 --> 00:18:14,201
Your mom says you were
one of the best dancers in the country.

312
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:16,584
Did she also tell you my dancing
got eight people killed?

313
00:18:16,624 --> 00:18:19,427
Yeah. She said your shoe came off. It wasn't your fault

314
00:18:19,491 --> 00:18:22,582
Yeah well, you tell that to their families.

315
00:18:23,126 --> 00:18:26,106
Look, Butters, accidents happen.
We all have to live with that.

316
00:18:26,153 --> 00:18:28,331
I let those people down!
Don't you get it man?!

317
00:18:28,347 --> 00:18:30,013
Eight people died!

318
00:18:30,253 --> 00:18:32,880
Well, it was nine, actually.
One of the women was pregnant.

319
00:18:32,992 --> 00:18:34,001
Oh what?

320
00:18:34,027 --> 00:18:36,892
And eleven if you count the two family members
that killed themselves afterward.

321
00:18:37,444 --> 00:18:38,759
But that isn't the point, Butters!

322
00:18:38,899 --> 00:18:40,719
The point is that this is now!
It's on!

323
00:18:40,743 --> 00:18:42,610
And there are people who need you to step up!

324
00:18:42,690 --> 00:18:44,876
Look, nobody likes having to rise to a challenge.

325
00:18:44,877 --> 00:18:48,810
But competing against other people and getting in their
faces saying "Haha! I'm better than you!" is part of life.

326
00:18:48,811 --> 00:18:53,493
And if you can't face that, then you might as well
sit here and play Leggos until you're an old man.

327
00:18:53,845 --> 00:18:55,694
Get out of my room, Stan!

328
00:18:56,546 --> 00:18:57,926
Fine.

329
00:18:58,528 --> 00:19:01,594
But someday you're gonna have to stop running from
what happened and start dealing with it.

330
00:19:01,595 --> 00:19:04,809
Otherwise, you might as well move
to France with all the other pussies.

331
00:19:15,257 --> 00:19:18,007
Yeah, make some noise!

332
00:19:21,416 --> 00:19:22,999
Ladies and Gentlemen,

333
00:19:23,041 --> 00:19:24,794
man, you are all in for a treat!

334
00:19:24,795 --> 00:19:28,061
Whichever crew wins tonight,
you wanna remember their faces,

335
00:19:28,062 --> 00:19:29,628
'cause the next time you see them...

336
00:19:29,629 --> 00:19:31,811
will be in Lil Kim's next video!

337
00:19:31,812 --> 00:19:33,562
Give it up for Lil Kim!

338
00:19:34,124 --> 00:19:36,562
What's up, niggaz?!

339
00:19:37,333 --> 00:19:40,178
This is gonna be a rough battle, y'all.

340
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:43,062
So let's give it up for the OC Crew!

341
00:19:46,323 --> 00:19:49,656
And the challengers, the South Park Diggitys!

342
00:19:51,339 --> 00:19:54,473
Man, it is about to get crazy up in here.

343
00:19:54,489 --> 00:19:55,739
Aww yeah.

344
00:19:55,906 --> 00:19:58,339
Aight y'all. It's showtime!

345
00:19:58,356 --> 00:20:00,123
Dancers to the floor!

346
00:20:01,589 --> 00:20:03,629
Stan. Stan, we have a big problem.

347
00:20:03,669 --> 00:20:06,443
- What?
- It's Jeffy. He sprained his ankle.

348
00:20:09,255 --> 00:20:10,015
What happened??

349
00:20:10,028 --> 00:20:12,535
He was practicing the say takedown
and slipped on the floor.

350
00:20:12,586 --> 00:20:15,213
- Come on, fools! You dancin' or what?!
- Can he move it?

351
00:20:16,639 --> 00:20:19,812
- Aw, what do we do, Chef??
- Rules are you have to have five dancers.

352
00:20:19,845 --> 00:20:22,832
We have no choice, children.
We have to forfeit.

353
00:20:22,872 --> 00:20:24,565
Looks like they ain't even gonna dance.

354
00:20:24,579 --> 00:20:27,805
They're too scared!
Looks like they already got served!

355
00:20:34,898 --> 00:20:35,684
Hey!

356
00:20:35,751 --> 00:20:38,031
Can I still dance with you guys?

357
00:20:38,537 --> 00:20:40,564
- Butters!
- All right!

358
00:20:42,503 --> 00:20:46,503
All right come on, let's do this!
DJ! Give us a hot track!

359
00:21:11,181 --> 00:21:11,994
Waaah!

360
00:21:16,144 --> 00:21:18,531
No! Jesus, not again!

361
00:21:19,651 --> 00:21:20,704
Kill him!

362
00:21:28,258 --> 00:21:31,884
Folks, it looks like the OC crew is dead.

363
00:21:32,618 --> 00:21:35,832
That means the winner is the South Park Diggitys!

364
00:21:36,934 --> 00:21:39,294
- All right!
- All right! We did it!

365
00:21:39,334 --> 00:21:41,401
- All right Butters!
- You dd it!

366
00:21:41,414 --> 00:21:43,361
You did it, son! You did it!

367
00:21:43,603 --> 00:21:45,243
All right, Butters!

368
00:21:46,763 --> 00:21:50,457
Noho! Noho!
Noooooo!

369
00:21:53,252 --> 00:21:58,006
