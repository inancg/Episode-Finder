00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,580
Captain Cartman reporting
from Shuttlecraft Spontaneity.

5
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:42,890
Approaching planet Omega Nine.

6
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:45,190
Warp drive disengaged.
Landing sequence initiated.

7
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:48,000
What kind of atmosphere are you
reading on the planet surface, Jew?

8
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:49,720
I'm a Vulcan!

9
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:52,300
All right, what kind of atmosphere
are you reading, Vulcan Jew?

10
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:55,920
The atmosphere is oxygen-based,
should support our breathing.

11
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,328
All right, hang on. We're about to land.

12
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:03,700
Okay, First Officer Stan and Engineer Kenny,
you come with me on the away team.

13
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:05,000
Vulcan Jew Kyle will wait here.

14
00:01:05,050 --> 00:01:09,160
- No! I'm on the away team too!
- It's my Mom's new minivan, so I'm the captain, Kyle!

15
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:11,210
I don't care! You're not making
me wait in the van again!

16
00:01:11,290 --> 00:01:15,900
Fine, Kyle! But if something goes wrong out there
on the planet surface, don't hold me responsible.

17
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,500
Set phasers on stun.

18
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:25,300
- Things seem pretty quiet.
- Yes. A little too quiet.

19
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:28,450
I am picking up carbon-based
 life forms in Sector C.

20
00:01:28,450 --> 00:01:31,060
I believe we will find a village of peaceful
aliens over that ridge.

21
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:33,500
Okay, fine, I guess we'll look for- Oh no!!

22
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:36,250
Look out!! It's a giant four-headed lava frog!!

23
00:01:36,290 --> 00:01:37,900
Shoot it!!

24
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:40,256
Oh no, it got Kyle!!

25
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:41,990
No it doesn't.

26
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,090
Aw, it got Kyle and it's tearing his head off!!
Aw you guys, it looks like Kyle is done for.

27
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:48,580
No I'm not! Goddamnit Cartman,
you're not gonna kill me off again!

28
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,780
Agh! You see guys, this is why you don't bring Jews
along on the away team: they don't play along!

29
00:01:52,790 --> 00:01:54,930
Shut up about Jews, fatass!
You don't know anything!

30
00:01:54,940 --> 00:01:55,940
Oh God, here we go again.

31
00:01:55,950 --> 00:02:00,790
Oh yeah?! I saw Mel Gibson's movie, The Passion, and
Mel Gibson says, in the movie, Jews are the Devil!

32
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:01,600
He does not!

33
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:04,804
How do you know?!
I've seen The Passion thirty-four times now, Kyle!

34
00:02:04,804 --> 00:02:06,005
You haven't seen it once!

35
00:02:06,005 --> 00:02:09,067
 There's even one part where the Jews have a chance to save Jesus, 
and you know what they do? 

36
00:02:09,067 --> 00:02:12,668
They let Barabbas, a serial killer, 
go free instead and laugh about it.

37
00:02:12,692 --> 00:02:14,240
- Naw uh!
- Go see the movie, Kyle!!

38
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:17,200
That does it! I'm sick of you guys
arguing about The Passion! I'm out of here.

39
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:20,090
I'm not arguing about The Passion!
He's being an asshole!

40
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:23,880
You know what it is? You're scared.
You're scared of the truth.

41
00:02:23,890 --> 00:02:26,500
You don't want that movie to show
you just how bad the Jews are,

42
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:28,990
- and why everyone hates you.
- People don't hate the Jews!

43
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Really? Three hundred million domestic box-office, Kyle.
The top-grossing film of all time, Kyle.

44
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,700
Those numbers don't lie.

45
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,900
If you're not scared of The Passion then go see it.
Go see it and tell me I'm wrong.

46
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,400
Mel Gibson, Kyle.
Mel Gibson.

47
00:02:46,190 --> 00:02:47,500
...You're a stupid asshole!

48
00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:54,800
Sweeet, now I can just play with myself.

49
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:56,500
Get back in the shuttlecraft!

50
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:09,000
One please.

51
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:11,700
This is an R-rated movie.

52
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:12,600
Yeah, I know, but I have to-

53
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:18,019
But, because this is such an important film that
actually depicts the selfless act of Jesus Christ,

54
00:03:18,019 --> 00:03:19,105
I'll let you in to see it.

55
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:22,400
...Thanks.

56
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:18,100
How? How could the Jews do that to Jesus?

57
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:20,000
Pretty brutal, isn't it?

58
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:23,400
Kinda wanna make you change your life, huh?

59
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:26,600
"And now, back to Terrance and Phillip"
Hey Terrance, I think I have a-

60
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:30,000
Mom! Doorbell!

61
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:35,500
Mom! Answer the door!

62
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:37,593
Goddamnit, lazy-ass whore.

63
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:45,880
You were right... You were right all along...

64
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:48,300
 I thought you were just an asshole 
when you ripped on Jews, but...

65
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:51,600
I didn't know, I... I didn't know.

66
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:55,142
It's okay, Kyle. It's okay.

67
00:04:55,142 --> 00:04:57,567
Just... say that first part again?

68
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
You were right?

69
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:03,500
Mmm, one more time, Kyle.

70
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
You were right.

71
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:11,000
I want to thank you for all
the blessings you have brought me.

72
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:15,300
You have shown me the way so many times in the past and...
 now you are making all my dreams come true.

73
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:19,000
You give me strength when there is doubt, 
and I praise you for all you have done.

74
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:23,260
Only you, Mel Gibson, have had the wisdom
and the courage to show the world the truth.

75
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:27,700
From this day forward I will dedicate my life
to making sure your film is seen by everyone.

76
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:30,600
I will organize the masses so that
we may do thy bidding.

77
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:33,800
Hail Mel Gibson. Amen.

78
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:39,800
Look at that, dude. The Passion has made
almost 400 milliion dollars at the box office now.

79
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:42,500
Everyone in the country's gonna see that movie.

80
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:44,800
I guess... we have to ge see it too.

81
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:12,580
Dude. That movie sucked.

82
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,500
How can they even call that a movie?

83
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,700
That's bullcrap dude, let's go get our money back.

84
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:24,000
Wow, I didn't realize how horrible
Christ's death was.

85
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,200
Me neither. Oh honey, let's be
good Christians from now on!

86
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:32,900
I think if more people saw The Passion
they'd have faith in Jesus.

87
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:36,000
Yeah, it really guilt-trips you into believing.

88
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,200
Hey, we want our money back.

89
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:40,950
Huh?

90
00:06:40,950 --> 00:06:43,000
That movie sucked ass.
Give us back our eighteen dollars.

91
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,700
I can't refund your money.
You sat through the whole movie.

92
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:47,900
That wasn't a movie, that was a snuff film!

93
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:50,700
You can't charge people to watch
a guy get tortured for two hours!

94
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:55,100
That guy happened to be Jesus,
and he went through all that to pay for YOUR SINS!

95
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:57,900
We go to church to learn that stuff!
We go to movies to be entertained!

96
00:06:57,900 --> 00:06:59,500
We weren't entertained,
and we want our money back!

97
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:03,000
I'm now allowed to give you your money back
after you sat through the whole movie!

98
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
You'd have to take your complaint up
with the film's producers.

99
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,850
W-what? Mel Gibson? You're saying we have
to get our money back from Mel Gibson?

100
00:07:08,850 --> 00:07:10,500
Yeah. I'd like to see you try.

101
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:12,450
Oh, we will! This is America!

102
00:07:12,450 --> 00:07:15,150
And in America, if something sucks,
you're supposed to be able to get your money back!

103
00:07:15,150 --> 00:07:15,951
Come on, Kenny!

104
00:07:25,150 --> 00:07:28,650
- Kill him! Guilty! Kill him!
- Kill him!

105
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:34,650
Kill him! Die!

106
00:07:35,450 --> 00:07:37,850
Kill Jesus! Yesss!

107
00:07:54,265 --> 00:07:57,300
Okay, search for Mel Gibson.

108
00:07:57,600 --> 00:08:00,600
Mel Gibson bio, Mel Gibson news,
Mel Gibson... home page. Here we go.

109
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:02,700
Welcome to Mel Gibson's ThePassion.com,

110
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:05,020
your source for everything Mel. Pictures,
philosophy, upcoming projects.

111
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:06,274
Damnit, no phone number!

112
00:08:06,274 --> 00:08:09,389
Oh wait! "For more information on Mel Gibson,
 call the Webmaster at 1-800-43.." 

113
00:08:09,389 --> 00:08:10,678
Okay, okay, wait, here we go.

114
00:08:18,530 --> 00:08:20,330
Mel Gibson's The Passion Fan Club.

115
00:08:20,330 --> 00:08:22,540
Hi, uh, my friend
and I just went to see The Passion.

116
00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:26,585
Uh huh, and so you want to join the fan club now.
Our first meeting is at 5:30 p.m.

117
00:08:26,585 --> 00:08:28,600
Nonono, no, we want our money back

118
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:29,775
What?

119
00:08:29,775 --> 00:08:32,401
We think the movie sucked and we want 
Mel Gibson to give us back our eighteen dollars. 

120
00:08:32,401 --> 00:08:33,529
Do you know how we can get in touch with him?

121
00:08:33,553 --> 00:08:37,299
You thought it sucked? Sir, apparently, 
you don't understand what Mel Gibson was trying to do!

122
00:08:37,299 --> 00:08:38,943
 He was trying to express, through cinema,

123
00:08:38,943 --> 00:08:42,935
the horror and filthiness of the common Jew.
It has made people the world over open their eyes.

124
00:08:42,935 --> 00:08:46,897
Look, kid, we just thought it was a bad movie,
 so tell us how to get in touch with Mel Gibson so we can get our money back!

125
00:08:46,897 --> 00:08:50,800
If I knew where Mel Gibson was,
 I'd be down on the floor licking his balls at this very moment, sir.

126
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:55,823
All I know is he lives somewhere in Malibu.
 Now stop wasting me and Mel Gibson's time, you little wussy prick.

127
00:08:55,823 --> 00:08:58,200
Hey, don't take that tone with me,
kid! I'll kick your ass!

128
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:01,300
Ohoh yeah?! I'd like to see you try, asshole!
I'm like six feet tall!

129
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:03,123
I don't care! You sound like a little bitch to me!

130
00:09:03,123 --> 00:09:05,500
Bitch?! Don't call me bitch!
I'll pop your fuckin' head open!

131
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:06,900
Yeah?! You wanna bring it, you little pussy?!

132
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:10,600
I already brought it, bitch! I brought it,
set it down on the table and opened it, bitch!

133
00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:13,400
Wait a minute. Cartman?!

134
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:19,700
Come on, Kenny, we're going to Malibu!

135
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:23,700
We'll take the bus! Look, 
this isn't about the eighteen dollars ticket money anymore.

136
00:09:23,850 --> 00:09:29,050
This is about being able to hold bad filmmakers responsible!
This is just like when we got our money back for BASEketball!

137
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:40,600
Eric, sweetie, there's a bunch of people showing up in our backyard
 saying something about a meeting?

138
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:43,950
Yeah Mom, I'm holding a meeting for all 
the people who loved The Passion as much as I did.

139
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:46,500
- Oh, that's great, sweetie.
- Tell them I'll be down shortly

140
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:48,000
Okay, hon.

141
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:51,350
Töten sie die Juden!

142
00:09:51,350 --> 00:09:54,450
Wir können nicht stillstehen
bis sie alle tot sind!

143
00:09:54,850 --> 00:09:58,850
Okay, I'm ready.
I'm ready to do thy bidding, Mel Gibson.

144
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Hello, are you folks holding this Passion meeting?

145
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,650
No. Actually, we're guests as well. I'm Jack Garrett
and this is my wife Elise.

146
00:10:08,650 --> 00:10:09,500
Hello.

147
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:12,920
I think it's so great that someone took
the initiative to have a meeting like this.

148
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:16,100
Oh I agree. There are so many of us
who are moved by The Passion.

149
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:19,700
It's a perfect idea to have us organize
so we can strengthen the Christian community.

150
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:23,000
And apparently the organizer is just an
eight year old boy who was touched by the film.

151
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Leave it to a child to show us all the way, huh?

152
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:30,180
Yeah, so I see this ad on the Internet saying if you love
The Passion to come to this meeting, so here I am!

153
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:34,150
It's great that everyone came here to figure out how
to use The Passion to enrich everyone's lives.

154
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:38,380
Ah hello everyone. Achtung.

155
00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:44,000
My name is Eric Cartman
and I'm the President of the Mel Gibson Fan Club.

156
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:48,900
Ah thank you, thank you. I'm happy to see that
all of you.were affected by The Passion like I was.

157
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:54,340
Now, we all know why we're here, and I believe
we all what needs to be done.

158
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:55,619
We sure do.

159
00:10:56,700 --> 00:11:02,350
But, I think it's best we don't talk out loud about
it until we have most of them on the trains heading to the camps.

160
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,150
- Wha, what does that mean, sweetie?
- I'm not sure, but-uh.

161
00:11:07,150 --> 00:11:09,522
Folks, I just wanna interrupt for a second

162
00:11:09,522 --> 00:11:13,000
and say how remarkable it is that this little boy
brought us all together.

163
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:18,900
The Passion is causing a revolution of spirituality, 
and we owe Mel Gibson and this little boy our thanks.

164
00:11:19,850 --> 00:11:21,550
Thank you, thank you very much.

165
00:11:21,550 --> 00:11:26,700
Now, in order to do what we all know needs
to be done, we are first going to need more support.

166
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:29,890
I think we should all go out and take at least
one other person to see The Passion.

167
00:11:29,890 --> 00:11:34,377
Oh, what a great idea! We each make it
our responsibility to convert one more person!

168
00:11:34,377 --> 00:11:36,129
Heheh great! Yeah! Great idea.

169
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:39,800
Yes, and then we can begin the cleansing,
if you know what I mean.

170
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:41,780
- We sure do!
- Yeah. All right. Woohoo!

171
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:49,000
Thank you.

172
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:50,481
This must be the place.

173
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:56,280
Goddamn, Mel Gibson must be loaded.

174
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:04,000
Yes?

175
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:07,000
Oh, hi, uh, my name is Stan, and this is Kenny

176
00:12:07,690 --> 00:12:11,328
Uh, we saw your movie, The Passion, and we didn't
like it, so, can we have our money back, please?

177
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,150
You can't not like The Passion!
I just followed the Bible!

178
00:12:16,150 --> 00:12:18,880
Christ died for you. Go home.

179
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:23,900
Look, dude, we came a long way.
We're not leaving until you give us our money.

180
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:27,760
Oh yeah? Well you're gonna have to find it first.
But I won't tell you where I keep my money.

181
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:30,150
You can torture me all you want,
I still won't tell you!

182
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:31,480
Tor-torture you?

183
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:34,207
Ha! So you DO intend to torture me, huh?!

184
00:12:34,207 --> 00:12:35,766
Well go ahead!

185
00:12:36,231 --> 00:12:40,900
 Do your worst!
You STILL won't get your ticket money back!
I can take whatever you can dish out!

186
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,350
We don't want to torture you.

187
00:12:42,450 --> 00:12:45,000
I get it, but you don't have a choice, is that it?!

188
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:49,050
Well go ahead! I just sure hope you don't
use those whips over there on the wall!

189
00:12:49,050 --> 00:12:51,800
Dude, can we please just have
the eighteen dollars back from you?

190
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,823
I have to use that money to build my church!

191
00:12:53,823 --> 00:12:58,111
 I brought the fire and brimstone back to Christianity with
 The Passion and now I'm gonna start my own church!

192
00:12:58,313 --> 00:13:01,100
And do you know why?!
So I can play banjo!

193
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:04,900
Jesus, oh how I love ya,
how I love ya Jesus!

194
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:06,990
Dude, this guy is freakin' daffy!

195
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:11,580
How dare you call me crazy!
This means war!

196
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:23,980
And so it was that God sent his only
son down from heaven, to die for our sins.

197
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:29,280
Oh okay, but did God sent Jesus TO die,
or did Jesus just get kind of screwed over.

198
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:32,150
...What is troubling you, my child?

199
00:13:32,150 --> 00:13:34,000
Well, I have this friend, see?

200
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,000
And this friend belongs to a certain,
Chosen People of Israel.

201
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,880
And it ...so happens that these chosen
people killed your Lord.

202
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,580
Ah! You mean he's a Jew!

203
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:44,880
Right. But he can't live with the guilt anymore.

204
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:48,251
Because, even if Jesus wasn't really the Son of God,
 he was still a nice guy. 

205
00:13:48,251 --> 00:13:50,337
And he didn't deserve what happened
 to him in Mel Gibson's movie.

206
00:13:50,361 --> 00:13:53,000
I I can't sleep at night. I mean,
my... friend can't sleep at night.

207
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,580
Yes, The Passion is very powerful.

208
00:13:55,580 --> 00:13:58,700
The truth is, there's not a whole lot
in the Bible about the Crucifixion.

209
00:13:58,700 --> 00:14:03,680
The Passion was actually done as a performance piece back in 
the Middle Ages to incite people against the Jews.

210
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:05,300
But how can the Jews make it better??

211
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:08,900
Well, if you really care about your friend's soul,
then perhaps show him the way of Jesus.

212
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:11,980
Remember: Christianity is about... atonement.

213
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:17,580
Wait. That's it. Atonement. Of course.
I know what I have to do now. Thank you, Father.

214
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:26,650
Two days ago, I saw a vehicle that
would haul that tanker

215
00:14:26,650 --> 00:14:29,450
You wanna get outta here? Talk to me.

216
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:35,680
Mel Gibson is fucking crazy dude!
Wait! There's his wallet!

217
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:37,680
Freedom!!!

218
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,500
Awww crap, he's only got twenties!
You got two dollars, Kenny??

219
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:42,280
Jesus is Lord!!!

220
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:44,000
All right, let's get the hell out of here!

221
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:54,850
When you're a clown, nobody takes you seriously!

222
00:14:56,380 --> 00:14:58,180
Run, dude, run!

223
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:06,180
And good evening, friends!

224
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,200
One month ago today, this amazing
film opened in theaters.

225
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:19,480
And now, we proud few gathere here as a people
brought together by its message!

226
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:27,580
Fellow fans of Mel Gibson, our numbers have grown and now,
together, we have the power to change the world!

227
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:33,700
Now I believe we should take to the streets
and march in unwavering support of this important movie!

228
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:36,623
- What a great idea!
- It'll be like a parade!

229
00:15:36,623 --> 00:15:37,683
Good idea!

230
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:42,000
And as we march for The Pasion
we should also voice our support!

231
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:46,000
So, when I say
"Es ist Zeit für Säuberung,"

232
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:50,000
you all chant back
"Wir müssen die Juden ausrotten."

233
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:52,000
Well, what does that mean, dear?

234
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Oh, I think it's Aramaic.
You know, like in the movie.

235
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,180
Ooo, Aramaic. Cool.

236
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:01,300
What was our Aramaic line again?

237
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:03,780
Wir müssen die Juden ausrotten!!

238
00:16:04,150 --> 00:16:07,200
Wir müssen die Juden ausrotten.

239
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:09,300
Es ist Zeit für Rache!

240
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:11,400
Wir müssen die Juden ausrotten.

241
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:13,200
Oh huh, this is fun!

242
00:16:13,650 --> 00:16:16,400
All right, everyone!
Forward, march!

243
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:18,200
Es ist Zeit für Rache!

244
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:20,380
Wir müssen die Juden ausrotten.

245
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:24,880
- Es ist Zeit für Rache!
- Wir müssen die Juden ausrotten.

246
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,400
Nice.

247
00:16:30,422 --> 00:16:32,628
Shalom hak nak shalom. 

248
00:16:32,628 --> 00:16:39,500
And now one of our fine young shlokas, Kyle Broflovski,
 has asked if he could speak to the congragation.

249
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:41,000
Thank you, rabbi.

250
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:48,100
In 1973, the United States officially issued an apology
to the African American community for slavery.

251
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:52,550
In 1956, Germany officially apologized
for World War II AND the Holocaust.

252
00:16:52,550 --> 00:16:58,060
And now, I believe, in 2004, the Jewish community
needs to apologize for the death of Jesus.

253
00:16:58,450 --> 00:16:59,100
What?

254
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:01,600
Whatwhatwhaaat?!

255
00:17:01,650 --> 00:17:06,250
If we as a people choose not to believe that Jesus
is the Son of God, then we can still apologize

256
00:17:06,250 --> 00:17:09,800
for the brutal way in which he was killed,
and take our share of the responsibility for it.

257
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:11,100
Oh my God!

258
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Kyle, what on earth has gotten into you?!

259
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,885
- I saw The Passion.
- Oh no! The Passion?!

260
00:17:18,909 --> 00:17:21,500
This proves the anti-Semitic effect
that movie is having!

261
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:27,600
- Yeah, it makes Jews into stereotypes.
- Stereotyping Jews is terrible.

262
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:30,600
Something must be done to stop that movie!

263
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:32,700
Now, now, everyone calm down.

264
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:37,300
We live in a rational community,
and everyone knows this is just a movie.

265
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:39,100
There's no cause for alarm.

266
00:17:39,101 --> 00:17:45,764
- Wir müssen die Juden ausrotten!
- Es ist Zeit für Rache!
- Wir müssen die Juden ausrotten!

267
00:17:46,358 --> 00:17:52,541
- Es ist Zeit für Rache!
- Wir müssen die Juden ausrotten!
- Es ist Zeit für Rache!

268
00:17:56,700 --> 00:18:01,800
Well it looks like with these bus tickets we spend about eighty... 
seven dollars getting our money back from Mel Gibson.

269
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:03,700
But I think it's the principle
of the thing that matters.

270
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:09,200
Oh, you've got to be shittin' me.

271
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:13,200
Give me back my money!

272
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:15,900
Goddamn, that guy's crazy.

273
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:18,800
Hey dude, you've gotta speed up.

274
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:19,400
Huh?

275
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:21,600
Mel Gibson is chasing after us.
You've gotta go faster.

276
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:24,600
Haha, very funny, kid.
Sit down and stop playing games.

277
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:26,800
I'm not playing games. Mel Gibson is right
behind you and he's gonna-

278
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,100
What the hell?

279
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:35,300
- Hey! That's Mel Gibson!
- Yeah. I told you that!

280
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:36,900
Well, what the hell does he want?!

281
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:39,900
He wouldn't give us our money back for The Passion,
so we kinda took it.

282
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,400
You didn't like The Passion?
But it shows how Christ suffered for you.

283
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:46,000
Mel Gibson is a very spiritual man.

284
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:54,400
You guys, stop! Please.
You're gonna make people hate us more.

285
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:56,000
Can I help you?

286
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:00,400
This movie is causing anti-Semitism!
You must remove it from your theater!

287
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:01,900
That's right! Yeah! Remove your movie!

288
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:05,000
Remove it from the theater?
Fat chance!

289
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:07,900
- We demand you stop showing it!
- Yeah! Yeah!

290
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:11,600
Nonono! Don't become an angry mob!
The last time we did that we killed Jesus!

291
00:19:12,150 --> 00:19:13,150
Juden!

292
00:19:13,150 --> 00:19:16,680
- What's going on here?
- They're trying to have The Passion pulled from the theater.

293
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:19,200
This film is anti-Semitic
and it must be stopped!

294
00:19:19,250 --> 00:19:22,350
Nonsense!
Mel Gibson is a smart and spiritual man!

295
00:19:22,350 --> 00:19:24,100
There's nothing anti-Semitic about it!

296
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:27,000
It has reaffirmed all
of our faith in Christ.

297
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:31,500
It's made one of our little Jewish boys want
to apologize for the death of Jesus!

298
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:34,950
Well, maybe you should apologize.

299
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:38,000
- That's right! What he said.
- How dare you?!

300
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:40,450
Look out!!

301
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,200
Give me my eighteen dollars!

302
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,900
Mel! Gibson!

303
00:19:57,300 --> 00:20:01,000
Oh mein Savior! Mein Führer!
You're actually here!

304
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:04,680
Mr. Gibson, I have assembled the masses!
We are ready to do thy bidding!

305
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:06,400
Have I been a good boy, Mr. Gibson?!

306
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:10,400
So! You boys have led me here
to your secret base, huh?

307
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:13,300
I guess now you're gonna
start torturing me! Well!

308
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:16,900
Oh, my nipples are so tender!
Ddon't squeeze them anymore!

309
00:20:17,350 --> 00:20:20,000
That's... Mel Gibson?

310
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,500
H-he's not... quite as eloquent as I had pictured.

311
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:27,500
Well. I guess you wanna
torture me now, don't you?!

312
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:29,850
Dude, what's wrong with him?

313
00:20:29,850 --> 00:20:33,000
He's kookoo, dude. He's absolutely out of his mind.

314
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:36,100
You! You would all love
to torture me, wouldn't you?

315
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:39,580
Okay, fine. See what you can fit in there,
I can take it!

316
00:20:40,150 --> 00:20:43,500
Dude! I've been freaked out this whole
time because of THAT guy's movie?

317
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:49,000
Fine! If nobody here is man enough to torture me,
then just give me my eighteen dollars!

318
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,300
It's our eighteen dollars!
Your movie sucked!

319
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:55,300
You can't say my movie sucked,
or else you're saying Christianity sucked!

320
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:57,420
No, dude, if you wanna be Christian, that's cool,

321
00:20:57,420 --> 00:21:00,300
but, you should follow what Jesus taught
instead of how he got killed.

322
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:05,000
Focusing on how he got killed is what people did in
the Dark Ages and it ends up with really bad results.

323
00:21:06,690 --> 00:21:12,380
You know, he's right, Elise. We shouldn't focus
our faith on the torture and execution of Christ.

324
00:21:12,380 --> 00:21:18,500
Yeah. Lots of people got crucified in those times.
We shouldn't rely on violence to inspire faith.

325
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:23,300
Aw, aw, no, come on, people,
we're so close to completing my final solution!

326
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:25,600
Oh, dude, I feel so much better about being Jewish now

327
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:28,300
that I see that Mel Gibson
is just a big wacko douche.
