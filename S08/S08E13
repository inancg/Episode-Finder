1
00:00:01,898 --> 00:00:03,898
WilLoW :--) January 27th, 2005

2
00:00:35,899 --> 00:00:37,534
I don't know, that looks pretty high up.

3
00:00:38,322 --> 00:00:40,512
Yeah. I think it'd be better to start lower.

4
00:00:41,071 --> 00:00:42,758
Dude, I really don't think it's smart, Cartman.

5
00:00:44,590 --> 00:00:46,218
This is gonna be totally cool, you guys.

6
00:00:47,268 --> 00:00:48,873
It's not gonna work; just come down from there.

7
00:00:50,352 --> 00:00:51,940
...Geez, this looks a lot higher from up here.

8
00:00:53,390 --> 00:00:53,794
What's going on?

9
00:00:54,230 --> 00:00:55,716
Cartman thinks he can fly off of his roof.

10
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:00,787
Do it! Do it!

11
00:01:01,652 --> 00:01:02,262
I'm gonna.

12
00:01:02,969 --> 00:01:03,881
I wouldn't if I were you.

13
00:01:04,194 --> 00:01:05,610
Those wings don't look very strong.

14
00:01:05,907 --> 00:01:09,778
Don't listen to 'em, Cartman! I'm sure it'll work.
Go for it. Yaaay Cartman! Fly fly fly!

15
00:01:10,494 --> 00:01:11,318
Okay, here we go.

16
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:18,099
Since the days of Copernicus, man has dreamed of flight.
On this historic day, let us go on to

17
00:01:18,341 --> 00:01:19,337
Awww, go on and do it already!

18
00:01:19,337 --> 00:01:24,614
Hold on, I'm givin' my speech! On this historic day, we
remember the Wright Brothers: Orville and Redenbacher,

19
00:01:24,819 --> 00:01:26,963
whose dreams and visions inspired generations.

20
00:01:27,365 --> 00:01:28,128
He's not gonna do it.

21
00:01:28,586 --> 00:01:35,066
And now, again, one man's vision ushers in a new era of aerial travel,
proving the power of imagination and intellect.

22
00:01:35,568 --> 00:01:37,106
The magic... of flight!

23
00:02:03,409 --> 00:02:05,525
Oh my God! Eric! Eric,

24
00:02:05,711 --> 00:02:06,921
Mommy's here. Sweetie?

25
00:02:07,586 --> 00:02:08,809
Oh what's wrong with him?

26
00:02:09,247 --> 00:02:14,471
I'm afraid that your son is... incredibly stupid.
He thought he could fly with cardboard wings.

27
00:02:14,817 --> 00:02:19,061
The stupidity is so severe that it caused a fall,
which has... put him into a deep coma.

28
00:02:19,884 --> 00:02:22,487
Coma... My God, for- for how long?

29
00:02:22,845 --> 00:02:27,961
There's no telling. He may never recover.
We'll just have to wait. And see.

30
00:02:32,719 --> 00:02:36,525
Seasons change, time passes by.

31
00:02:36,927 --> 00:02:42,748
As the weeks become 
the months become the years.

32
00:02:44,436 --> 00:02:45,380
Eugh...

33
00:02:46,930 --> 00:02:48,410
Oh my... Doctor!

34
00:02:48,866 --> 00:02:49,751
He's awake!

35
00:02:51,036 --> 00:02:52,512
Wheh? Where am I?

36
00:02:53,017 --> 00:02:55,386
Oh, you've finally come back! It's a miracle!

37
00:02:55,719 --> 00:02:58,937
You're at the hospital, Eric. 
You've... been in a coma for some time.

38
00:02:59,283 --> 00:03:00,916
Coma... How long?

39
00:03:01,347 --> 00:03:05,378
It's been two days.
 Nurse, you can remove his face-warmer now.

40
00:03:05,742 --> 00:03:06,424
Yse, Doctor.

41
00:03:08,422 --> 00:03:13,288
Now, Eric, you've suffered massive head traume.
Your road to recovery will be long and arduous.

42
00:03:13,897 --> 00:03:15,076
At least another two days.

43
00:03:16,162 --> 00:03:19,988
Seasons change, time passes by.

44
00:03:20,456 --> 00:03:26,213
As the weeks become
 the months become the years.

45
00:03:26,786 --> 00:03:28,422
You're doing so much better, muffin.

46
00:03:28,854 --> 00:03:31,371
Why the hell do I have to share my room with other patients?
This is bullcrap!

47
00:03:31,684 --> 00:03:33,475
Oh, you're sounding just like your old self again.

48
00:03:34,227 --> 00:03:36,708
I'm sorry, detectives,
 there was nothing we could do.

49
00:03:37,138 --> 00:03:39,240
Damnit! Another murder victim! 

50
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:43,519
For three years the Left-Hand killer has 
been at large and I've exhausted every lead!

51
00:03:43,672 --> 00:03:47,340
Maybe... I just don't have what it
 takes to be a cop anymore.

52
00:03:47,892 --> 00:03:49,471
We'd better get back to the station, sir.

53
00:03:49,834 --> 00:03:51,663
Good, because you assholes have
 kept me up for three hours!

54
00:03:52,138 --> 00:03:55,300
All right, let's go, Murphy. Hang on a second,
where are, where are my car keys?

55
00:03:55,663 --> 00:03:56,912
Probably in your front pocket, dumbass!

56
00:04:02,002 --> 00:04:04,555
Doctor, didn't you say that kid suffereed head trauma?

57
00:04:04,885 --> 00:04:06,176
Yes, it was pretty severe.

58
00:04:06,559 --> 00:04:07,257
What is it, Lou?

59
00:04:07,504 --> 00:04:11,882
I've... heard cases where people suffering head
trauma awaken to some psychic abilities.

60
00:04:12,188 --> 00:04:13,060
Aw, come on, sir.

61
00:04:13,361 --> 00:04:14,112
I know it's ridiculous

62
00:04:14,283 --> 00:04:16,135
, but I'm gonna explore every possibility I can.

63
00:04:18,249 --> 00:04:20,328
Hello, young man, could we have a quick word with you?

64
00:04:20,654 --> 00:04:22,872
Not now! The nurse is gonna walk
 in any minute with my lunch.

65
00:04:24,003 --> 00:04:25,323
Twelve-thirty, Eric. Lunch time.

66
00:04:27,317 --> 00:04:30,712
Young man, how did you know 
the nurse was gonna walk in just now?

67
00:04:31,492 --> 00:04:32,523
I don't know, I just knew it.

68
00:04:33,894 --> 00:04:35,427
Aww man, this smells like meatloaf. Again?!

69
00:04:35,983 --> 00:04:36,829
Yep, meatload again.

70
00:04:38,555 --> 00:04:39,557
Jesus, how did he...?

71
00:04:40,258 --> 00:04:41,120
Little boy...

72
00:04:41,572 --> 00:04:42,954
Well it's a snowball's chance in hell but...

73
00:04:43,542 --> 00:04:47,757
we were wondering if you could come down and see if your.
.. new powers could help us catch the killer.

74
00:04:48,285 --> 00:04:49,480
His new... powers?

75
00:04:52,132 --> 00:04:54,483
All right, make sure you get pictures
of everything in this crime scene.

76
00:04:57,375 --> 00:04:58,339
Who's the kid?

77
00:04:58,635 --> 00:05:00,137
He's supposed to be some kind of psychic.

78
00:05:00,278 --> 00:05:01,431
Aw Christ.

79
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:03,584
This is... where the body was found.

80
00:05:04,222 --> 00:05:06,607
Multiple stab wounds, just like all the others.

81
00:05:07,438 --> 00:05:08,781
How come the outline is missing its hand?

82
00:05:09,543 --> 00:05:14,312
The killer always cuts off the left hand of his victim,
and keeps it as a trophy.

83
00:05:17,495 --> 00:05:18,341
Stand back, give him room!

84
00:05:21,011 --> 00:05:23,858
Come on, kid, concentrate! 
What do you see in your mind?

85
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:35,730
Ice cream. Covered with... chocolate sprinkles...

86
00:05:37,777 --> 00:05:38,777
Double-Stuff Oreos...

87
00:05:41,370 --> 00:05:42,936
He ... He's taking the top of one and...

88
00:05:45,447 --> 00:05:47,164
...and he puts it together to make Quadruple-Stuffs!

89
00:05:48,671 --> 00:05:51,221
I see...ice cream, and sprinkles, 
and Quadruple-Stuffs!

90
00:05:51,530 --> 00:05:52,169
Jesus Christ!

91
00:05:52,550 --> 00:05:53,003
Sir?

92
00:05:53,285 --> 00:05:55,836
Tom Johannsen, the owner of the ice cream shop!

93
00:06:00,809 --> 00:06:02,872
Yes? Oh, hello, detectives.

94
00:06:03,399 --> 00:06:05,229
Mr. Johansen, 
could we have a quick word with you?

95
00:06:05,783 --> 00:06:06,770
Wuhsure, come on in.

96
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:10,335
I'm afraid the house is a little bit
 of a disaster area since I have

97
00:06:10,712 --> 00:06:11,112
Get him!

98
00:06:11,335 --> 00:06:12,917
Code 6! Code 6!

99
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:16,356
Use the taser! Use the taser!

100
00:06:18,218 --> 00:06:18,691
Do it again!

101
00:06:21,658 --> 00:06:23,489
He put up a hell of a fight, but we got him!

102
00:06:23,917 --> 00:06:25,491
Why? Why??

103
00:06:26,470 --> 00:06:30,088
Congratulations, Eric. You just stopped the
biggest killer in South Park history.

104
00:06:30,411 --> 00:06:34,614
We would give you a reward, but I guess that knowing the
people of South Park are safe again is reward enough.

105
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:36,342
Guess again.

106
00:06:37,228 --> 00:06:37,997
All right, here's a hundred dollars.

107
00:06:38,465 --> 00:06:39,108
Wow!

108
00:06:39,558 --> 00:06:44,692
His powers are uncanny. Take good care of him, Ms.
Cartman. Make sure he uses his powers for good.

109
00:06:45,019 --> 00:06:48,072
Oh he will. My little poopsiekins is a very good little boy.

110
00:06:51,261 --> 00:06:56,488
I'm a psychic and you are worse.
 I have super-awesome powers. You don't.

111
00:06:57,361 --> 00:06:58,279
Cartman, what did you do?!

112
00:06:58,930 --> 00:07:02,187
Oh, didn't you hear, Kyle? I used my new psychic
abilities to catch the serial killer.

113
00:07:02,468 --> 00:07:03,573
And I made a hundred bucks!

114
00:07:04,338 --> 00:07:07,236
Nice old Mr. Johansen runs a candy shop!
He wasn't a killer and you know it!

115
00:07:07,563 --> 00:07:09,427
Then why did I see ice cream
 and cookies when I closed my eyes?

116
00:07:09,753 --> 00:07:11,460
Because you're a fucking fatass, that's why?!

117
00:07:11,809 --> 00:07:12,948
Do not doubt my powers, Kyle!

118
00:07:13,194 --> 00:07:14,116
You don't have any powers!

119
00:07:14,325 --> 00:07:16,790
Don't make me do it, Kyle! I can make your
head explode with a single thoght!

120
00:07:17,603 --> 00:07:18,488
Wuh be careful, Kyle.

121
00:07:18,847 --> 00:07:19,719
He can't do crap!

122
00:07:20,082 --> 00:07:22,803
Fine, Kyle! You asked for it! Hee-at!

123
00:07:28,345 --> 00:07:29,383
There he is! Hey, Eric!

124
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:31,928
We've got a little problem.

125
00:07:32,425 --> 00:07:32,815
What?

126
00:07:33,186 --> 00:07:36,860
While the ice-cream store owner was in jail,
another murder was commited.

127
00:07:37,385 --> 00:07:40,887
This body also had a missing hand and
a bowl of corn flakes next to it!

128
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:42,887
Which can only mean one thing!

129
00:07:43,396 --> 00:07:44,403
Ha! You see?!

130
00:07:44,801 --> 00:07:50,157
That a copycat killer is on the loose! We need your
psychic abilities to catch this new guy right away!

131
00:07:50,605 --> 00:07:51,072
What?!

132
00:07:51,386 --> 00:07:54,389
We'll pay you up front this time! We've gotta
catch this new guy before he kills again.

133
00:07:55,144 --> 00:08:00,491
I'm afraid that my powers... are not for sale. ...And
by that I mean they absolutely are for sale.

134
00:08:00,995 --> 00:08:01,601
Let's go!

135
00:08:02,584 --> 00:08:08,685
Tom, I'm standing in a meadow just outside of town where police
have discovered the first victim of the serial copycat killer.

136
00:08:09,256 --> 00:08:12,216
Child wunderkind Eric Cartman is now arriving on the scene.

137
00:08:15,379 --> 00:08:16,643
This is fuckin' ridiculous!

138
00:08:17,381 --> 00:08:19,272
Whattaya got, wunderkind?
 Are ya seeing anything?

139
00:08:20,693 --> 00:08:21,956
No. Nothing.

140
00:08:23,070 --> 00:08:24,731
Maybe his powers have left him.

141
00:08:25,184 --> 00:08:25,662
Yeah.

142
00:08:26,667 --> 00:08:27,152
Wait a minute.

143
00:08:32,007 --> 00:08:34,179
Fried chicken. It's tender and it's fresh.

144
00:08:36,863 --> 00:08:39,376
There's maple syrup... 
Maple syrup's being put on the chicken.

145
00:08:39,952 --> 00:08:40,905
What the hell is wrong with these people?!

146
00:08:41,689 --> 00:08:49,090
They're never gonna catch the serial killer.
 He's too smart. Do you want to see my cotton panties?

147
00:08:50,807 --> 00:08:52,071
Hey! What about this guy?!

148
00:08:52,498 --> 00:08:53,553
Quiet! He's havin' a vision!

149
00:08:54,358 --> 00:08:55,063
It is fried chicken!

150
00:09:01,298 --> 00:09:03,666
Oh my God. It's a fried chicken sundae.

151
00:09:04,707 --> 00:09:09,969
"Junior, what are you doing out?" I'm sorry, Mother.
"You come home rigtht now and have sex with me!

152
00:09:10,315 --> 00:09:11,221
" No, Mommy!

153
00:09:14,410 --> 00:09:15,862
Hey, uh, does anyone know who that guy is?!

154
00:09:16,170 --> 00:09:19,165
I said quiet, you little brat, or I'll have
you arrested for interfering with the law!

155
00:09:21,508 --> 00:09:25,340
This is Park County News 4,
 with your host, Jim Brown-ish

156
00:09:25,783 --> 00:09:29,546
The copycat killer of the cut-off-the-left-hand
killer has been arrested.

157
00:09:30,063 --> 00:09:31,917
Police used the help of Eric Cartman,

158
00:09:32,216 --> 00:09:37,731
a wunderkind psychic detective. At the crime scene, the
young psychic had visions flash before his mind,

159
00:09:38,213 --> 00:09:42,114
and the police immiedately arrested the
owner of Kentucky Fried Chicken.

160
00:09:42,662 --> 00:09:43,205
The young man's

161
00:09:43,426 --> 00:09:46,451
visions were so astounding that other police
departments have sought out his help.

162
00:09:49,741 --> 00:09:52,447
If I'm happy and I know it, clap my hands.
*clap* *clap* If I'm happy and I know it,

163
00:09:52,708 --> 00:09:53,827
clap my hands. *clap* *clap*

164
00:09:54,846 --> 00:09:57,638
Eric, sweetie, there's um, 
some people here to see you.

165
00:09:58,281 --> 00:10:01,869
More people need to make use of my phenomenal gifts,
huh? Ahhh, it's so very tiring.

166
00:10:02,473 --> 00:10:06,272
Ah, no, these people claim that they
are the "real" psychic detectives.

167
00:10:09,508 --> 00:10:12,649
So, you are the little boy who's been taking all our work?!

168
00:10:13,384 --> 00:10:14,438
Oooh, I'll go make some tea.

169
00:10:15,553 --> 00:10:21,386
Kid, we have a problem. You didn't go through the proper
channels to become a psychic detective like we all did.

170
00:10:21,792 --> 00:10:22,474
Yeah!

171
00:10:23,018 --> 00:10:23,596
Proper channels?

172
00:10:23,949 --> 00:10:26,985
You were supposed to fill out the form
on the back of the comic book and pay

173
00:10:27,195 --> 00:10:30,706
the twenty five dollar fee for the degree
from the Psychic Detective School.

174
00:10:31,709 --> 00:10:35,324
I was given my gift from a tragic accident. I didn't
need to go to Psychic Detective School.

175
00:10:35,714 --> 00:10:39,310
Well you just can't say you're a psychic detective,
you have to use the ad in the comic book!

176
00:10:39,613 --> 00:10:43,191
You must pay the twenty five dollar fee and
give us ten percent of yoru earnings!

177
00:10:47,510 --> 00:10:49,156
Ten percent my balls, get lost!

178
00:10:50,114 --> 00:10:53,329
Very well, then you give us no choice. Roger?

179
00:11:07,206 --> 00:11:07,967
All right everyone!

180
00:11:18,239 --> 00:11:19,560
Oh, poopsies, what's going on?

181
00:11:20,562 --> 00:11:22,476
Stand back, mother! 
We're having a telekinetic battle of minds!

182
00:11:23,808 --> 00:11:24,657
O-o-o-o-o-oh!

183
00:11:25,814 --> 00:11:26,279
Enough!

184
00:11:29,944 --> 00:11:35,481
We are ...obviously quite evenly matched.
 I guess this will have to be settled in court.

185
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:36,562
In court?

186
00:11:37,111 --> 00:11:41,218
We brought a class-action lawsuit against you!
We'll see you before the judge tomorrow!

187
00:11:44,780 --> 00:11:45,504
Is it over?

188
00:11:52,296 --> 00:11:53,038
Her name is...

189
00:11:53,062 --> 00:11:58,568
Veronica Crabtree, busdriver for the elementary school.
She was considered an ancillary character,

190
00:11:58,594 --> 00:12:00,175
one the fans wouldn't miss much.

191
00:12:00,796 --> 00:12:02,037
Jesus Christ! Cause of death?

192
00:12:02,719 --> 00:12:06,203
Same MO, sir. Multiple stab wounds,
 left hand cut off and missing.

193
00:12:06,561 --> 00:12:10,850
So you're telling me somebody new is now copying
the crimes of the copycat killer?

194
00:12:11,307 --> 00:12:12,675
! Jesus! Where will it end?!

195
00:12:13,857 --> 00:12:17,431
Every time I put a killer behind bars, another
guy just steps in and takes his place!

196
00:12:17,871 --> 00:12:18,765
What am I doing wrong?!

197
00:12:19,277 --> 00:12:23,126
Excuse me, sir? I think I know who did this.
We saw this guy at the last crime scene,

198
00:12:23,408 --> 00:12:25,668
and, and you know how serial killers sometimes
return to the scene of the crime?

199
00:12:26,118 --> 00:12:28,494
Well, I followed this guy to his house, 
and when he left again,

200
00:12:28,494 --> 00:12:30,769
I collected some fingerprints 
and did a blood-sample analysis.

201
00:12:30,914 --> 00:12:32,092
I'm pretty sure he's your man.

202
00:12:32,430 --> 00:12:33,635
How do you know?? Are you psychic??

203
00:12:33,925 --> 00:12:34,410
No.

204
00:12:34,499 --> 00:12:38,512
Look, kid, don't waste my time with your
blood-sampling fingerprinty hocus-pocus!

205
00:12:38,815 --> 00:12:42,434
I have to find this new killer now!
I owe it to that victim over there!

206
00:12:42,827 --> 00:12:46,098
I know she hadn't been in any recent episodes,
but DAMNIT she deserved better than this!

207
00:12:46,698 --> 00:12:48,516
Come on, Murph, we've gotta
 talk to Eric Cartman again!

208
00:12:50,364 --> 00:12:51,513
Why won't anybody listen to me?!

209
00:12:51,868 --> 00:12:53,032
(Don't take it personally, Kyle)

210
00:12:53,316 --> 00:12:55,450
I AM taking it personally because 
Cartman is a retard! 

211
00:12:55,450 --> 00:12:58,871
Just because he hit his head 
and went into a coma doesn't mean he's a- Wait,

212
00:12:59,053 --> 00:13:02,818
that's it. If I want people to listen to me,
I just have to be as stupid as Cartman.

213
00:13:04,897 --> 00:13:06,382
Dude, I really don't think that's a good idea!

214
00:13:06,761 --> 00:13:07,678
There has to be another way!

215
00:13:08,737 --> 00:13:10,133
Be sure to take me to the same hospital!

216
00:13:10,817 --> 00:13:15,764
Now Kyle, don't fly too close to the sun, 
or it'll burn your wings, an- and you'll crash into the ocean.

217
00:13:17,187 --> 00:13:18,166
Butters, Goddamnit.

218
00:13:18,688 --> 00:13:19,778
All right, here we go.

219
00:13:20,376 --> 00:13:24,253
Since the days of Copernicus, man has dreamed of flight.
On this historic day we rerme- aw screw it!

220
00:13:29,098 --> 00:13:29,879
Call an ambulance.

221
00:13:31,682 --> 00:13:37,527
Multiple arrests were made today for the murder of Hillary Neals.
Police raided the South Park Motel 6 at 4 a.m.,

222
00:13:37,794 --> 00:13:39,805
where seven psychic detectives were staying.

223
00:13:51,965 --> 00:13:56,711
The psychic detectives' horrible crime was found
out by psychic detective Eric Cartman,

224
00:13:57,226 --> 00:14:01,448
who is now the only psychic not behind bars.
What an amazing coincidence.

225
00:14:02,404 --> 00:14:03,310
Cool.

226
00:14:04,546 --> 00:14:06,677
Ah, Kyle is at the door. Come in, Kyle!

227
00:14:12,919 --> 00:14:13,655
Who are you?

228
00:14:13,922 --> 00:14:19,112
You, you give everyone else credit for my work,
because you fail to see my greatness.

229
00:14:20,895 --> 00:14:21,933
... 'K. Sweet.

230
00:14:23,195 --> 00:14:26,821
Because of you, 
nobody knows the extent of my deeds.

231
00:14:28,019 --> 00:14:30,631
Oh yeah. Awesome.
 Hold on, just a second.

232
00:14:31,310 --> 00:14:33,620
Mom, there's some homeless guy here.
 Make him go away.

233
00:14:42,064 --> 00:14:43,285
Hey. Hey, what's goin' on??

234
00:14:44,002 --> 00:14:46,186
You are obviously a big fan of my work.

235
00:14:46,761 --> 00:14:47,779
I don't even know you dude!

236
00:14:48,934 --> 00:14:53,171
But I am the serial killer! The one whose rightful
place in history you have smirched!

237
00:14:53,868 --> 00:14:54,550
Oh Jesus.

238
00:14:54,986 --> 00:14:58,576
And now you will have a place of honor,
 as my nineteenth victim.

239
00:14:58,883 --> 00:15:01,923
No! No, you don't wanna kill me. Please,
I'll give you anything you want!

240
00:15:02,356 --> 00:15:07,934
Before you die, let me show you the things that I've done,
so you will understand the breadth of my transformation!

241
00:15:10,472 --> 00:15:12,732
This... is me at the grand canyon.

242
00:15:14,916 --> 00:15:18,572
Do you see? This is me at Mount Rushmore

243
00:15:18,956 --> 00:15:19,871
Do you see?

244
00:15:20,245 --> 00:15:20,689
Heheh.

245
00:15:20,896 --> 00:15:21,685
Do you see??

246
00:15:21,886 --> 00:15:22,670
Yes yes, I see!

247
00:15:23,155 --> 00:15:25,008
Here I am at the Alamo in San Antonio.

248
00:15:25,331 --> 00:15:27,579
This was just outside of the gift shop. Do you see??

249
00:15:27,841 --> 00:15:28,548
AAAAAAAH!

250
00:15:33,018 --> 00:15:38,454
Damnit! Damnit all to hell! They just found another body!
That means a fifth copycat killer is on the loose!

251
00:15:38,694 --> 00:15:39,683
Where's my psychic?!

252
00:15:39,933 --> 00:15:42,992
Sorry, Sarge, the psychic's mom says her son
hasn't been home for a couple of hours.

253
00:15:43,675 --> 00:15:47,750
Sir! Dr. Kels just called from the hospital! He
says another little boy just awoke from a coma,

254
00:15:48,039 --> 00:15:49,282
and is having psychic visions!

255
00:15:50,522 --> 00:15:51,149
Let's go!

256
00:15:53,117 --> 00:15:56,697
This is the young man here.
 He was in a coma for over sixteen hours.

257
00:15:59,637 --> 00:16:02,145
Doctor, could you remove his face warmer?
 We'd like to speak with him.

258
00:16:02,419 --> 00:16:03,124
Of course. Nurse?

259
00:16:05,979 --> 00:16:09,664
Young man, the doctor said you've had some.
.. visions about our newest murder?

260
00:16:10,943 --> 00:16:13,871
I see... a man... with a baseball cap.

261
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:19,572
He's killing now... Oh! I'm seeing it all flash before my eyes!
The guy's name is Michael Deets,

262
00:16:19,796 --> 00:16:23,005
and he lives at 621 Castillo Street. He's
usually there between seven and eleven p.

263
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:23,515
m.

264
00:16:24,014 --> 00:16:24,798
What do you think, Mitch?

265
00:16:25,341 --> 00:16:30,838
I don't know. How do we know this kid is really psychic?
I mean, this boy is certainly no Eric Cartman.

266
00:16:32,312 --> 00:16:35,948
All right, we'll check this Deets guy out. But
let's use that one thing that we never use.

267
00:16:36,589 --> 00:16:37,112
...Sir?

268
00:16:37,426 --> 00:16:39,616
You know, what's that one thing that
starts with an R that we never use?

269
00:16:40,859 --> 00:16:41,414
...Restraint?

270
00:16:41,646 --> 00:16:44,902
Yeah yeah, restraint. We'll check this guy out,
but let's use some restraint.

271
00:16:45,994 --> 00:16:50,351
Look! Look at the things I've done! Here
I am at Yellowstone National Park!

272
00:16:50,571 --> 00:16:54,405
Do you see?! Here are pictures of my
trip to Cheyenne for Frontier Days.

273
00:16:54,621 --> 00:16:55,133
Do you see?!

274
00:16:55,382 --> 00:16:57,744
Oh my God! I'm so bored! Somebody help me!

275
00:17:04,906 --> 00:17:07,418
Good evening, sir.
 We're Park County detectives. 

276
00:17:07,418 --> 00:17:09,954
We were just wondering if we could 
take a quick look around your house,

277
00:17:09,978 --> 00:17:10,752
Misterrr...

278
00:17:11,526 --> 00:17:12,257
God.

279
00:17:13,014 --> 00:17:16,031
Well Mr. God, it won't take but a second;
it might help us with an investigation.

280
00:17:25,010 --> 00:17:26,499
(Hey! Come over here!)

281
00:17:27,290 --> 00:17:32,448
I see you like cutting the eyes out of photos of women.
My son is a big fan of that too.

282
00:17:33,698 --> 00:17:34,456
Sarge! In here!

283
00:17:39,971 --> 00:17:43,647
Jesus H.... That boy was right!
 Arrest that guy!

284
00:17:44,833 --> 00:17:47,848
Whoawhoawaitwaitheywait wait yo!
 Oh wait a minute, no ah, I'm wrong.

285
00:17:48,264 --> 00:17:48,774
Sir?

286
00:17:49,134 --> 00:17:52,419
This isn't the guy. The serial killer always
cuts off the victims' left hands.

287
00:17:53,024 --> 00:17:53,488
Right.

288
00:17:53,736 --> 00:17:54,455
Well those aren't left hands.

289
00:17:55,013 --> 00:18:00,353
See, on your left hand, the thumb faces to the left.
Those are all right hands.

290
00:17:59,869 --> 00:18:00,056
Ohhh.

291
00:18:01,055 --> 00:18:02,064
Nope, this isn't our man.

292
00:18:02,778 --> 00:18:04,927
We're sorry, Mr. God.
 It appears we've wasted your time.

293
00:18:06,152 --> 00:18:07,735
(Hey! Get me out of here!)

294
00:18:09,662 --> 00:18:12,164
Heh, pretty amazing coincidence that guy
had a bunch of hands on his wall.

295
00:18:12,476 --> 00:18:13,993
Heh, no wonder that boy thought he was a killer.

296
00:18:14,808 --> 00:18:17,229
Yeah... Amazing coincidence...

297
00:18:17,874 --> 00:18:18,604
Heh- sir?

298
00:18:18,914 --> 00:18:22,101
Call it police intuition, but sonethin'
in there just didn't feel right.

299
00:18:24,451 --> 00:18:25,174
Wait a minute.

300
00:18:25,910 --> 00:18:26,688
Sarge...

301
00:18:33,657 --> 00:18:34,300
What is it?

302
00:18:35,309 --> 00:18:37,199
I'm not sure. I'm gonna have to run some tests.

303
00:19:17,706 --> 00:19:20,985
Murphy, do you remember
 what I was supposed to be doing?

304
00:19:21,842 --> 00:19:27,387
Oh. Uhhh... Oh. Something about hands, sir?
 Uh for the serial killer?

305
00:19:27,716 --> 00:19:29,367
Oh right! The hands! Right!

306
00:19:41,555 --> 00:19:43,563
Oh my God. Murphy!

307
00:19:44,348 --> 00:19:45,925
You're not gonna believe this.

308
00:19:51,357 --> 00:19:53,010
That's it, no more pictures.

309
00:19:53,905 --> 00:19:54,920
Time to die.

310
00:19:55,455 --> 00:19:58,428
No, please! I'm sorry I gave other people credit for your killings.
Ahah, it was,

311
00:19:58,795 --> 00:20:01,381
it was very wrong for me to lie about the
other psychics and get them arrested.

312
00:20:01,898 --> 00:20:03,792
Your hand will be one with the others.

313
00:20:04,228 --> 00:20:06,842
Please just let me go! Ah I'm gonna tell
everyone I'm not really psychic!

314
00:20:07,103 --> 00:20:08,626
I've learned my lesson! 
Please, I don't wanna-

315
00:20:10,984 --> 00:20:13,108
I don't wanna have to use 
my psychic mind missile on you!

316
00:20:14,631 --> 00:20:16,223
Hold it right there, killer!

317
00:20:28,371 --> 00:20:29,685
You got here just in time.

318
00:20:29,685 --> 00:20:33,077
 He was gonna kill me because he was insanely
 jealous of my incredible psychic ability.

319
00:20:35,629 --> 00:20:40,220
Well young man, you did an amazing thing. Not only
did your psychic visions help us catch the killer,

320
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:42,680
but a lot of innocent people are out of jail.

321
00:20:43,153 --> 00:20:44,510
Yes, thank you very much, Kyle.

322
00:20:44,869 --> 00:20:46,005
Yes, thanks.

323
00:20:46,373 --> 00:20:47,803
You're certainly a better psychic then Eric.

324
00:20:48,172 --> 00:20:52,097
No, don't you see? Cartman never had psychic visions.
And neither do these people.

325
00:20:52,411 --> 00:20:54,237
The plain simple truth is that nobody is psychic.

326
00:20:54,653 --> 00:20:57,239
There's a logical explanation for every
psychic story you've ever heard.

327
00:20:58,358 --> 00:20:59,729
Do you think that's true?

328
00:20:59,795 --> 00:21:01,607
It must be true. The kid is psychic.

329
00:21:02,585 --> 00:21:06,578
But I don't suppose it really matters much. Because in the end,
the way I caught the killer was with.

330
00:21:07,168 --> 00:21:09,746
.. good old-fashioned police work.
 Come on, Murphy.

331
00:21:10,948 --> 00:21:14,767
Well young man, I guess that 
just leaves one score to settle.

332
00:21:15,063 --> 00:21:15,823
You can't hurt me.

333
00:21:16,228 --> 00:21:17,830
Then let this be our final battle!

334
00:21:23,146 --> 00:21:23,944
Just stop it!

335
00:21:25,564 --> 00:21:27,074
Stoopp iitt!!

336
00:21:32,167 --> 00:21:33,670
There's a logical explanation for that.
