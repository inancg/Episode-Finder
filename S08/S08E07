1
00:01:39,498 --> 00:01:39,814
Yes?

2
00:01:40,756 --> 00:01:45,067
Hel-lo ma'am. We're going around town
and offering snow-shoveling service.

3
00:01:45,337 --> 00:01:47,161
Would you like your driveway and sidewalk shoveled

4
00:01:47,366 --> 00:01:48,460
for eight thousand dollars?

5
00:01:49,266 --> 00:01:53,560
Oh well, I certainly could use some little snow-shovelers,
but eight thousand dollars seems a little steep.

6
00:01:53,951 --> 00:01:54,915
How about ten dollars?

7
00:01:55,447 --> 00:01:58,318
Ooo, ouch, ma'am, please, let go of that
tight grip you have on my balls!

8
00:01:58,744 --> 00:02:00,218
Ten dollars, you're breaking my balls, ma'am!

9
00:02:00,478 --> 00:02:01,679
How about fifteen dollars?

10
00:02:01,989 --> 00:02:04,266
It's a deal! All right, guys, let's get to work!

11
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:14,203
Yeah, it's so totally awesome. 
Craig crapped his pants when he saw it. Yeah, sweet.

12
00:02:14,774 --> 00:02:17,783
So what's goin' on over there? Yeah, that's pretty cool.

13
00:02:19,017 --> 00:02:22,300
No way! He did not! Aw dude, that is so weak.

14
00:02:24,131 --> 00:02:24,535
What?

15
00:02:25,051 --> 00:02:26,789
You've been on your fucking phone since we started!

16
00:02:27,074 --> 00:02:27,810
Dude, I'm takin' a break.

17
00:02:28,105 --> 00:02:29,629
A break from what?! You haven't done anything!

18
00:02:29,973 --> 00:02:31,542
Kyle, how many times do we have to go through this?

19
00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:34,646
I'm the negotiator.
I negotiate our price with the customers.

20
00:02:34,922 --> 00:02:36,318
All you ever do is talk about your balls!

21
00:02:36,678 --> 00:02:38,927
It works, doesn't it?
 Did I not just get us an extra five bucks?

22
00:02:39,341 --> 00:02:42,143
If you want your share of the money, then you're
gonna shovel snow like the rest of us!

23
00:02:42,362 --> 00:02:45,255
Hey! Don't boss me around, you fuckin' Jew!
 I will kick your ass!

24
00:02:51,124 --> 00:02:52,588
Ma'am, do you have a rag and some bandages?

25
00:02:53,347 --> 00:02:54,586
Oh goodness, what happened?

26
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,211
Shoveling accident.

27
00:02:56,749 --> 00:02:58,035
Oooh no, come on inside.

28
00:03:00,511 --> 00:03:01,704
Wait right here, I'll be right back.

29
00:03:03,415 --> 00:03:06,601
You're so lucky I have a... sore shoulder,
Kyle, or I'd totally let you have it.

30
00:03:06,896 --> 00:03:08,056
Cartman, just keep your mouth shut.

31
00:03:09,007 --> 00:03:11,306
This is breaking news. Here's Anchorman Aaron Brown.

32
00:03:11,657 --> 00:03:16,136
Incredible, absolutely amazing news today.
A man from the future has come

33
00:03:16,350 --> 00:03:20,093
back in time and is in a government
 hospital after being hit by a car.

34
00:03:21,097 --> 00:03:21,595
Whoa.

35
00:03:22,277 --> 00:03:23,438
Christina Naylon has more.

36
00:03:23,777 --> 00:03:28,392
The news is incredible, Aaron. Experts and scientists have
been with the man from the future for several hours now,

37
00:03:28,621 --> 00:03:31,406
and have been able to learn 
that he is from the year 3045.

38
00:03:31,783 --> 00:03:35,369
His condition is stable, and speculation
continues as to why he has come.

39
00:03:35,683 --> 00:03:37,405
Has he come to deliver a cure for cancer?

40
00:03:37,707 --> 00:03:39,259
Or to fix something wrong with the past?

41
00:03:39,828 --> 00:03:43,928
Have to interrupt you there, Christina. Apparently,
Brad Morgan is inside the base with breaking news.

42
00:03:44,052 --> 00:03:44,349
Brad?

43
00:03:44,608 --> 00:03:48,040
Aaron, the scientists have been able to
communicate further and have uncovered

44
00:03:48,195 --> 00:03:51,119
that the man from one thousand years
in the future has come to our time...

45
00:03:51,362 --> 00:03:53,721
looking for work. Now, uh he has said

46
00:03:53,872 --> 00:03:58,581
that the future is so overwhelmingly overpopulated
that there are simply no jobs in his time,

47
00:03:59,038 --> 00:03:59,938
and so he built a time portal

48
00:04:00,134 --> 00:04:02,931
and has come back to 21st century America,
uh to find a job here.

49
00:04:03,367 --> 00:04:05,982
Heheh, it's absolutely astounding. 
He came back here for work?

50
00:04:06,213 --> 00:04:10,421
Huh... that's right, Aaron. 
Hi-his plan is to get a job here, in our time,

51
00:04:10,685 --> 00:04:13,132
so that he can put the money he earns into a savings account,

52
00:04:13,413 --> 00:04:17,633
uh, which will earn interest, and by the
year 3045 be worth billions of dollars,

53
00:04:18,003 --> 00:04:20,874
uh which of course in the future will
be worth only hundres of dollars,

54
00:04:21,181 --> 00:04:22,990
but uh enough, he says, to feed his family.

55
00:04:23,131 --> 00:04:27,252
And now I understand we're going to Harrison Moore, uh,
for an explanation on how the time portal works.

56
00:04:27,656 --> 00:04:27,863
Harrison?

57
00:04:28,488 --> 00:04:33,209
Aaron, I'm standing at the time border which
scientists say follow Terminator rules.

58
00:04:33,654 --> 00:04:35,951
That is, it's one way only and you can't go back.

59
00:04:36,369 --> 00:04:38,968
This is in contrast, say, to Back To The Future rules,

60
00:04:39,305 --> 00:04:43,657
where back and forth is possible, and of course,
Timerider rules, which are just plain silly.

61
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:47,178
Anyway, it appears that the man from the future is here to stay.

62
00:04:50,002 --> 00:04:52,125
Mom, Dad! Did you see? 
They found a man from the future!

63
00:04:52,593 --> 00:04:53,933
We know, Stanley. We've been watching.

64
00:04:54,679 --> 00:04:57,589
If you're just joining us, 
a man from over two thousand years into

65
00:04:57,631 --> 00:05:01,007
the future has come through a one-way 
time portal looking for work.

66
00:05:01,007 --> 00:05:03,376
Uh, the President is expected to give an announcement at any time.

67
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:08,583
Breaking news here at the time portal, Aaron. It appears
that another person from the future has just arrived!

68
00:05:09,511 --> 00:05:12,771
It looks as if the job at Wendy's 
did work for the original immigrant;

69
00:05:12,813 --> 00:05:16,294
this second arrivee claims that
 man's family is now much better off,

70
00:05:16,294 --> 00:05:17,896
and wishes the same for his family.

71
00:05:21,647 --> 00:05:23,202
There you go. All set, sweetie?

72
00:05:23,636 --> 00:05:27,342
Mom, can we go try to see the people from the future?
I have a bunch of questions I wanna ask 'em.

73
00:05:27,744 --> 00:05:32,160
I'm sure a lot of people do, hon. It's pretty exciting,
isn't it? Now, you just get some sleep.

74
00:05:32,496 --> 00:05:33,024
You've had a busy day.

75
00:05:34,097 --> 00:05:34,830
Goodnight, sweetie.

76
00:05:35,111 --> 00:05:35,705
Night, Mom.

77
00:05:37,735 --> 00:05:41,079
Wow, two people from the future.
How cool.

78
00:06:14,799 --> 00:06:15,144
Yes?

79
00:06:15,907 --> 00:06:18,142
Hello, Mrs. Landis. Would you like
 snow-shoveling service again today?

80
00:06:19,168 --> 00:06:23,014
Ooo, oh dear, I'm sorry boys, but I've
already hired someone else to do it.

81
00:06:23,434 --> 00:06:24,134
What?? Who??

82
00:06:24,526 --> 00:06:27,941
One of those immigrants from the future. He
said he would do it for twenty-five cents.

83
00:06:28,413 --> 00:06:30,264
Twenty-five cents? 
Well that's not even worth it.

84
00:06:31,136 --> 00:06:32,660
All right guys, come on.
 Let's go to the next house.

85
00:06:35,016 --> 00:06:35,434
Dude.

86
00:06:41,245 --> 00:06:42,135
Son of a bitch!

87
00:06:42,937 --> 00:06:45,944
Still more immigrants from the future
arrived at the time border today,

88
00:06:46,326 --> 00:06:48,757
some even bringing their entire families. the purplish

89
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:53,725
goo that they have on their bodies when they arrive is
an ectoplasmic side effect of the time-travel process.

90
00:06:54,222 --> 00:06:58,437
This is all giving scientists a great opportunity to
learn even more about American life in the future.

91
00:06:58,752 --> 00:07:00,210
Chris Holt joins us now. Chris?

92
00:07:00,210 --> 00:07:03,736
Yes, there are incredible things we're learning
about Americans in the future,

93
00:07:03,986 --> 00:07:05,514
Aaron. Eh it appears that in the future,

94
00:07:05,959 --> 00:07:09,951
Americans have evolved into 
a hairless uniform mix of all races.

95
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:14,282
They are all one color, which is a yellowy
light-brownish whitish color.

96
00:07:14,826 --> 00:07:17,446
Uh it seems race is no longer an issue in the future,

97
00:07:17,679 --> 00:07:22,880
because all ethnicities have mixed into one. Perhaps most
interesting is how this has affected their language.

98
00:07:23,208 --> 00:07:26,507
The people in the future speak a complete mix of English,

99
00:07:26,724 --> 00:07:30,762
Chinese, Turkish and, indeed, all world languages,
which sounds something like this:

100
00:07:32,954 --> 00:07:33,926
Back to you, Aaron.

101
00:07:34,267 --> 00:07:37,578
Apparently the people from the future are
having a pretty easy time finding work.

102
00:07:37,945 --> 00:07:39,598
Since they offer to work for such low wages,

103
00:07:39,894 --> 00:07:41,663
they're being hired all over America.

104
00:07:43,448 --> 00:07:45,840
This is bullcrap! I ain't standin' for this!

105
00:07:46,105 --> 00:07:50,872
All right, folks, my name is Darryl Weathers and
I'm with the Construction Workers' Union.

106
00:07:51,415 --> 00:07:54,257
I work with a lot of fine men 
who have families to feed.

107
00:07:54,602 --> 00:07:56,768
Now I don't know about you all, 
but we worked long and

108
00:07:56,928 --> 00:07:59,981
hard to get our pay up to 
a level where we could make a decent living.

109
00:08:00,631 --> 00:08:06,091
And now these people from the future are showin' up
and offerin' to do the same work for next to nothin'!

110
00:08:06,698 --> 00:08:07,714
They took our jobs!!

111
00:08:11,215 --> 00:08:15,256
We're in the moving business! Fourteen years
we've been workin' our butts off!

112
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:18,231
Now these future folk come in 
and we can't get work nowhere!

113
00:08:18,567 --> 00:08:20,163
They took our jobs!

114
00:08:20,481 --> 00:08:21,297
They took your jobs!

115
00:08:23,374 --> 00:08:29,204
Well what about us in the fast-food business?! The restaurants
are firing us 'cause the future people work for a lot less!

116
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:31,271
They took our jobs!!

117
00:08:31,772 --> 00:08:33,409
They took your jobs!

118
00:08:35,911 --> 00:08:39,019
It's affecting kids too! Me and my friends
started our own snow-shoveling business.

119
00:08:39,382 --> 00:08:40,888
We were trying to be responsible and make money,

120
00:08:41,114 --> 00:08:44,097
you know? But then the people came along and,
and now we're out of work too!

121
00:08:46,733 --> 00:08:48,394
Oh, they took our jobs!!

122
00:08:48,708 --> 00:08:49,898
They took yer jobs!!

123
00:09:22,956 --> 00:09:25,401
Stanley, it's almost eight o'clock. 
Where have you been?

124
00:09:25,936 --> 00:09:28,792
I was at a rally to protest all the immigrants
from the future coming in and tryin' tuh-

125
00:09:29,953 --> 00:09:33,040
Oh yes, the laundry machine is down in
the basement and our son is home.

126
00:09:33,226 --> 00:09:34,338
Could you please set the table for dinner?

127
00:09:36,969 --> 00:09:37,428
Who is that?

128
00:09:37,967 --> 00:09:39,487
That's our new housekeeper, Mrs. Gruhd.

129
00:09:39,836 --> 00:09:41,981
She's gonna help around the house
 on Tuesdays and Thursdays.

130
00:09:42,583 --> 00:09:43,966
And she'll do it for ten cents an hour.

131
00:09:44,328 --> 00:09:47,097
Oh, but that's the problem!
 Those goobacks are taking our jobs!

132
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:48,191
What??

133
00:09:48,513 --> 00:09:49,183
Oh my God!

134
00:09:49,758 --> 00:09:52,763
Stan Marsh, how dare you use that time-bashing slur?!

135
00:09:53,263 --> 00:09:54,329
Who taught you to talk like that?!

136
00:09:54,988 --> 00:09:56,539
Well dude, they are taking people's jobs away.

137
00:09:57,050 --> 00:10:00,333
They're only taking the small menial jobs
that nobody else really wants to do.

138
00:10:00,736 --> 00:10:01,601
I wanted my job!

139
00:10:02,522 --> 00:10:06,433
Hey, Stanley, you need to understand something:
 Those people from the future have had a hard life!

140
00:10:06,924 --> 00:10:09,687
Where they come from is dirty 
and overpopulated and poor!

141
00:10:10,169 --> 00:10:14,602
You can't even imagine the kind of depression they come from!
So for us, who have everything sooo good,

142
00:10:14,857 --> 00:10:16,803
to judge them, is wrong! Do you understand?!

143
00:10:17,599 --> 00:10:19,305
Next time you think about calling them goobacks,

144
00:10:19,718 --> 00:10:23,105
you might just wanna stop for a second and think
about how crappy the future really is!

145
00:10:23,583 --> 00:10:26,286
That's right! We're not raising our son 
to be an ignorant timecist.

146
00:10:26,670 --> 00:10:27,403
Timecist?

147
00:10:27,794 --> 00:10:29,533
You know, a racist, but against people from the-

148
00:10:29,737 --> 00:10:30,700
People from the future. Right, got it.

149
00:10:31,023 --> 00:10:34,931
All right, good. Now, let's all go eat some of Mrs.
Gruhd's great future cooking.

150
00:10:35,948 --> 00:10:39,237
And now, here is Bill O'- Reilly.

151
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:42,309
Welcome welcome to the No-Spin Zone, all right?

152
00:10:42,351 --> 00:10:45,270
And what we're talkin' about today are 
the immigrants from the future.

153
00:10:45,399 --> 00:10:45,822
All right?

154
00:10:46,458 --> 00:10:49,936
Now, most people are more than happy to give a helping
hand to these people who obviously need it.

155
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:50,561
All right?

156
00:10:50,975 --> 00:10:54,070
But others are starting to say that the
time portal should be closed off.

157
00:10:54,557 --> 00:10:55,055
All right?

158
00:10:55,478 --> 00:10:58,392
Now, I've got two guests with me tonight
who have opposing views on the matter.

159
00:10:58,992 --> 00:11:02,225
On my right is pissed-off
 white-trash redneck conservative.

160
00:11:02,751 --> 00:11:03,683
Thanks for having me, Bill.

161
00:11:04,218 --> 00:11:07,061
And on my left is aging hippie liberal douche.

162
00:11:07,447 --> 00:11:07,939
Hello.

163
00:11:08,567 --> 00:11:12,426
Now, pissed-off redneck, you say we shouldn't
allow anyone else through the time portal,

164
00:11:12,671 --> 00:11:12,905
aright?

165
00:11:13,202 --> 00:11:20,136
You're Goddamned right! These people from the future are takin'
all the work away from us decent present-day Americans!

166
00:11:20,732 --> 00:11:22,727
They took our jobs!

167
00:11:23,157 --> 00:11:24,561
They took our jobs!

168
00:11:25,389 --> 00:11:27,900
Those jobs belong to people from the present!

169
00:11:28,305 --> 00:11:31,008
Aright. What say you, 
aging hippie liberal douche

170
00:11:31,557 --> 00:11:35,489
Heh it's typical for conservatives rednecks like
these to view the immigrants as the problem,

171
00:11:35,836 --> 00:11:36,545
heh, but really,

172
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:41,918
the problem is America. It is our greedy multinational
corporations that keep everyone else in poverty.

173
00:11:42,190 --> 00:11:46,265
Your ancestors came to America as immigrants. What
right do you have to turn these people away?

174
00:11:47,046 --> 00:11:48,344
Aright, redneck, your rebuttal?

175
00:11:50,836 --> 00:11:52,699
They took our jobs!

176
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:54,604
They took our jobs!

177
00:11:55,098 --> 00:11:56,541
Too-kourderb!

178
00:11:59,982 --> 00:12:05,989
All right, children, the school board has mandated that I must
now teach class in both present-day English and Futurespeak.

179
00:12:07,030 --> 00:12:07,454
What?!

180
00:12:08,027 --> 00:12:13,105
So, with that in mind, let's continue our lessons on verbs.
Remember that there are transitive verbs such as

181
00:12:13,627 --> 00:12:18,144
"The boy threw the red ball," 
which in Futurespeak of course, is...

182
00:12:20,552 --> 00:12:21,263
Everyone say it with me?

183
00:12:27,447 --> 00:12:29,763
Aaand there are intransitive verbs, such as

184
00:12:30,413 --> 00:12:37,223
"The 11:15 bus from Denver arrived twelve hours late.
" Or in Futurespeak, "Vvut."

185
00:12:38,684 --> 00:12:39,130
"Vvut."

186
00:12:40,157 --> 00:12:44,291
Dude, hold on! This is bullcrap! If they wanna live in our time,
then they should learn our language!

187
00:12:44,656 --> 00:12:45,105
Yeah!

188
00:12:45,548 --> 00:12:45,861
That's right!

189
00:12:46,279 --> 00:12:50,877
Hey now, these immigrants have a right to retain their culture.
Who are we to say our language is best?

190
00:12:51,273 --> 00:12:53,913
They deserve to have an education just as much as you do.

191
00:12:54,433 --> 00:12:56,102
Thank you, aging hippie liberal douche.

192
00:12:56,608 --> 00:12:57,054
You betcha.

193
00:12:59,017 --> 00:13:00,049
Timmih.

194
00:13:00,236 --> 00:13:03,152
Okay, now let's get back to it, kids.
 What kind of verb is this?

195
00:13:03,972 --> 00:13:10,104
"The sad girl puts balls in her mouth." Or, in Futurespeak of course,
"Gluch gligh balls glych gligh."

196
00:13:11,761 --> 00:13:12,259
This is bullcrap!

197
00:13:14,734 --> 00:13:18,430
Listen up, everybody! We've just received
a reply from our congressman.

198
00:13:19,767 --> 00:13:24,611
"Dear intolerant rednecks, we sympathize
with you all losing your jobs.

199
00:13:25,134 --> 00:13:27,121
However, we feel your solution of

200
00:13:27,327 --> 00:13:31,138
shooting everyone who
crosses the time border is inhumane."

201
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:32,221
What?

202
00:13:32,438 --> 00:13:33,078
That's ridiculous!

203
00:13:33,973 --> 00:13:34,252
They can't do that!

204
00:13:34,483 --> 00:13:35,103
That was a good idea!

205
00:13:35,461 --> 00:13:40,977
So it appears the government ain't gonna help us! Which
means we gotta take matters into our own hands!

206
00:13:41,269 --> 00:13:46,611
The only way to stop people from the future
is to stop the future from happening!

207
00:13:47,016 --> 00:13:53,096
Hey that's right! If there is no future, then there'll be
no people from the future to come back and take our jobs!

208
00:13:53,548 --> 00:13:54,601
Take rjurbs

209
00:13:55,205 --> 00:13:59,929
All right! So, any ideas how we can
 stop the future from happening?

210
00:14:02,714 --> 00:14:07,097
How about we cause more global warming, 
so that in the future,

211
00:14:07,139 --> 00:14:11,685
the polar ice caps melt, 
and and it ushers in a new ice age?

212
00:14:14,634 --> 00:14:18,083
How the hell is global warming gonna cause an ice age?!

213
00:14:18,674 --> 00:14:23,634
Well you know, the... global warming could bring
on like a climate shift or somethin'?

214
00:14:23,978 --> 00:14:28,509
Chet, you are a fuckin' retard, you know that?!
Even if global warming were real,

215
00:14:29,002 --> 00:14:31,380
which all proven scientific data shows it isn't,

216
00:14:31,784 --> 00:14:34,917
it would take millions of years 
for a climate shift to happen!

217
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,170
You think an ice age can just happen 
all of a sudden-like?

218
00:14:38,294 --> 00:14:40,042
Well I was just tryin' to be helpful.

219
00:14:40,452 --> 00:14:44,448
Well help yourself to a fuckin' science book,
'cause you're talkin' like a fuckin' retard!

220
00:14:45,026 --> 00:14:48,231
Now, come on people, we've got to think!
 Damnit, they took our jaorbs!

221
00:14:48,824 --> 00:14:49,790
They took our jobs!

222
00:15:22,460 --> 00:15:22,933
Aw, dude.

223
00:15:24,471 --> 00:15:25,459
Gaur da'ka?

224
00:15:26,174 --> 00:15:27,722
Can you speak in present-day English please?

225
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:31,690
Uh oh... Can I help... you?

226
00:15:32,824 --> 00:15:34,904
Uh yeah, 
I want a double cheeseburger and fries.

227
00:15:37,144 --> 00:15:38,067
Chicken sandwich?

228
00:15:39,298 --> 00:15:41,363
No, a double cheeseburger and fries!

229
00:15:42,276 --> 00:15:42,938
A cheeg- fry?

230
00:15:43,304 --> 00:15:43,632
What?!

231
00:15:44,191 --> 00:15:44,624
A cheeg- fry?

232
00:15:45,032 --> 00:15:46,162
We can't understand you, asshole!

233
00:15:51,813 --> 00:15:52,200
Can I help you?

234
00:15:53,231 --> 00:15:54,859
I'm trying to order a double cheeseburger!

235
00:15:56,078 --> 00:15:57,170
Chicken sandwich?

236
00:15:58,228 --> 00:15:59,926
No, it's not a chicken sandwich!

237
00:15:59,946 --> 00:16:04,264
I want a Goddamned cheeseburger and some
Goddamned fries you fucking goobacks!

238
00:16:05,068 --> 00:16:06,727
Stan Marsh!

239
00:16:07,424 --> 00:16:08,661
Aw-awwww.

240
00:16:10,958 --> 00:16:14,847
Come on, people, think! How are we gonna stop
these immigrants from takin' our jobs!

241
00:16:15,496 --> 00:16:15,976
Hey, I got an idea. Uh maybe we should 
all take off all our clothes,

242
00:16:16,018 --> 00:16:22,232
scramble into a big pile 
and start gettin' gay with each other.

243
00:16:25,249 --> 00:16:26,104
Did you say "get gay"?

244
00:16:27,185 --> 00:16:29,514
Hey yeah. Well that's not a bad idea!

245
00:16:30,182 --> 00:16:30,965
What? Gettin' gay?

246
00:16:31,945 --> 00:16:36,265
Think about it: These people are from the future, right?
Well, if we can git everyone to turn queer,

247
00:16:36,633 --> 00:16:38,653
then there won't be no children to have no children,

248
00:16:39,020 --> 00:16:41,851
and the people from the future won't exist to take our jobs!

249
00:16:43,657 --> 00:16:44,555
I ain't turnin' queer.

250
00:16:45,255 --> 00:16:49,376
You have to, Jimbo, or else we won't be able to stop them!
They too 'r jaobs!

251
00:16:49,783 --> 00:16:50,990
Yeah, they took our jobs!

252
00:16:51,613 --> 00:16:52,334
Took our jobs!

253
00:16:52,948 --> 00:16:56,934
Let's go over to that part of town that all 
the future people moved into

254
00:16:57,017 --> 00:16:59,770
and start humpin' each 
other until they disappear!

255
00:17:00,003 --> 00:17:00,362
Come on!

256
00:17:02,706 --> 00:17:05,041
Come on! You want your jobs back or not?!

257
00:17:16,090 --> 00:17:22,090
All right, you future bastards! Think you can take our jubs?!
Well, we'll show you! Come'ere, Earl!.

258
00:17:25,645 --> 00:17:26,748
How do you like that, gooback?!

259
00:17:30,339 --> 00:17:31,029
Come on, you guys!

260
00:17:37,876 --> 00:17:43,049
Everyone who believes in America, join in with us!
 We're gonna make these future bastards nonexistent!

261
00:17:47,076 --> 00:17:49,109
Aw, come on, Dad!
 How come I have to go to work with you?

262
00:17:49,625 --> 00:17:53,697
Because you're being grounded, Stanley! Now I don't wanna
hear another word out of your intolerant mouth!

263
00:17:55,620 --> 00:17:58,025
You just sit right there, Stanley, and
you thnk about what you've done!

264
00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:02,949
You'll find all the copiers and printers
in the next room over and then uh-

265
00:18:03,216 --> 00:18:03,694
Hey, Mr. Nelson.

266
00:18:04,270 --> 00:18:07,400
Oh... R-Randy... Uh I'm surprised to see you here.

267
00:18:07,775 --> 00:18:08,612
Why? This is my office.

268
00:18:09,144 --> 00:18:13,594
Ooohh boy, didn't you get my phone message?
 Ooo, this is awkward.

269
00:18:13,677 --> 00:18:16,597
Well, the thing is, Randy, 
you've been- replaced.

270
00:18:16,817 --> 00:18:17,197
What?

271
00:18:17,631 --> 00:18:21,021
Well we found an immigrant from the future who knows
geology and he offered to work for next to nothing.

272
00:18:21,595 --> 00:18:23,103
Uh, this is Mr. Glughgogawk.

273
00:18:23,833 --> 00:18:24,484
Gheglo.

274
00:18:25,571 --> 00:18:26,347
You can't be serious.

275
00:18:27,126 --> 00:18:31,676
I'm... sssorry, Randy. It's just, with all the budget cuts and all,
we'll give you some time to clean out your desk.

276
00:18:32,437 --> 00:18:35,706
Follow me, Mr. Glughgogawk.
 I'll show you to the copy room.

277
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:42,714
Oh my God. They took my jarb!!

278
00:18:43,230 --> 00:18:44,231
They took yer jarb!!

279
00:18:45,359 --> 00:18:46,259
This is CNN.

280
00:18:46,943 --> 00:18:50,340
Breaking news at the time border. 
We go now live to Harrison Moore.

281
00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:55,282
Aaron, I'm standing at the time border where
some kind of mass protest has broken out.

282
00:18:55,813 --> 00:19:01,090
Hundreds of men who have lost their jobs to time
immigrants are here having sex with one another.

283
00:19:01,855 --> 00:19:05,118
These men have apparently sucked and
screwed their way across the state

284
00:19:05,424 --> 00:19:08,413
and are now here at the time border trying to get national attention.

285
00:19:09,078 --> 00:19:14,957
These unemployed men have been having sex for several days.
Joining me is their spokesperson, Randy Marsh.

286
00:19:16,070 --> 00:19:18,300
Mr. Marsh, what exactly are you trying to accomplish?

287
00:19:18,936 --> 00:19:21,161
We're doing the only thing we can do.

288
00:19:21,245 --> 00:19:25,059
If our government is just gonna let 
anybody into our time who wants to come,

289
00:19:25,059 --> 00:19:26,785
then we have to take matters into our own hands.

290
00:19:27,437 --> 00:19:32,406
We're trying to turn everyone gay so that there are no future humans!
Present-day America Number One!

291
00:19:32,787 --> 00:19:33,616
Yeah America!

292
00:19:34,074 --> 00:19:34,864
Take our jobs!

293
00:19:35,635 --> 00:19:39,847
Do you really think you can get enough people to
turn gay to destroy the future of humanity?

294
00:19:40,452 --> 00:19:41,695
All we can do is try, Harrison.

295
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:47,767
Trying to stop immigration is intolerant and ignorant.
Those immigrants have a right to pursue happiness.

296
00:19:48,016 --> 00:19:49,676
Young man, what do you think about all this?

297
00:19:50,704 --> 00:19:53,805
I I think it's wrong to call them goobacks
because they're no different from us.

298
00:19:54,413 --> 00:20:00,181
They're just humans trying to make their lives better. Look,
it sucks that the immigrants' time is so crappy,

299
00:20:00,181 --> 00:20:01,798
but the cold hard truth is that if we
let them all come back to our time,

300
00:20:01,922 --> 00:20:03,620
then it's just gonna make our time crappy too.

301
00:20:03,662 --> 00:20:06,707
Maybe the answer isn't trying 
to stop the future from happening,

302
00:20:06,724 --> 00:20:08,188
but making the future better.

303
00:20:10,108 --> 00:20:10,443
Huh?

304
00:20:11,043 --> 00:20:13,772
I mean, maybe if we all commit right now
to working toward a better future,

305
00:20:14,012 --> 00:20:15,480
then, then the future won't be so bad,

306
00:20:15,734 --> 00:20:17,864
and, these immigrants won't need 
to come back here looking for work.

307
00:20:19,698 --> 00:20:25,171
Hey. He's right. If we build for a better future,
the immigrants will stay there.

308
00:20:25,871 --> 00:20:29,426
Yeah. We've got to start working towards a brighter tomorrow.

309
00:20:29,835 --> 00:20:31,073
Well what are we waiting for?

310
00:20:35,625 --> 00:20:39,968
We've got to work for a better future,
we've got to join hands for tomorrow.

311
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:44,871
Take the first step and you will see
the future begins with you and me.

312
00:20:47,155 --> 00:20:51,676
We can start to make a difference
 if we want it for our children

313
00:20:51,925 --> 00:20:56,755
Recycle that can and plant that tree, 'cause
the future begins with you and me.

314
00:20:57,709 --> 00:20:58,507
Look, it's working!

315
00:21:00,144 --> 00:21:01,361
The future begins with you and me.

316
00:21:01,703 --> 00:21:02,987
The immigrants are fadin' away!

317
00:21:03,497 --> 00:21:04,009
We're doing it!

318
00:21:05,453 --> 00:21:09,721
We've got to work for a better future,
we've got to join hands for tomorrow.

319
00:21:10,199 --> 00:21:12,856
Take the first step and you will see the future-

320
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:14,860
Dude, wait wait ho, hold on. Wait a second.

321
00:21:15,162 --> 00:21:15,589
This is gay.

322
00:21:16,016 --> 00:21:16,889
This is really gay.

323
00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:20,694
Yeah, this is even gayer than all the men getting
in a big pile and having sex with each other.

324
00:21:21,315 --> 00:21:23,486
Okay, sorry, my bad,
 e-everyone back in the pile.

325
00:21:23,933 --> 00:21:25,327
Back in the pile everyone!

326
00:21:25,746 --> 00:21:26,630
We're going back to the pile.

327
00:21:27,067 --> 00:21:27,456
Jump in!

328
00:21:27,685 --> 00:21:28,157
Come on, everybody!

329
00:21:28,348 --> 00:21:29,285
Never mind, we're going back to the pile!

330
00:21:29,619 --> 00:21:30,565
Took ur jurb!

331
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:35,600
