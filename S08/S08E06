3
00:00:52,413 --> 00:00:53,135
Hey, check it out, dude.

4
00:00:53,151 --> 00:00:54,546
Somebody bought the Donovans' old house.

5
00:00:54,741 --> 00:00:55,756
Yeah, I think they already moved in.

6
00:00:55,896 --> 00:00:57,579
I saw moving vans in their driveway two days ago.

7
00:00:57,946 --> 00:01:00,480
I hope they're not Austrians.
That's the last thing this town needs.

8
00:01:00,724 --> 00:01:01,235
Hey look!

9
00:01:04,235 --> 00:01:04,973
Hello.

10
00:01:06,916 --> 00:01:08,609
Hey. Do you live here?

11
00:01:08,645 --> 00:01:10,469
Yeah, I just moved here with my dad.

12
00:01:10,605 --> 00:01:12,575
Are you gonna be my new friends?

13
00:01:12,987 --> 00:01:13,557
No.

14
00:01:14,227 --> 00:01:15,693
I really like your town.

15
00:01:15,807 --> 00:01:18,444
My dad wanted to move somewhere
to get away from it all.

16
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:20,333
He said he wanted piece and quiet,

17
00:01:20,447 --> 00:01:23,117
and to live with a bunch of hicks
who don't know anything.

18
00:01:24,648 --> 00:01:25,625
What's that you're wearing?

19
00:01:26,092 --> 00:01:30,179
It's my mask. My daddy says it's best
for me to hide my face.

20
00:01:30,553 --> 00:01:32,116
My name's Blanket.

21
00:01:32,524 --> 00:01:35,650
Your name is Blanket. Right.
Well, Blanket, I'm Howdy Doody,

22
00:01:35,699 --> 00:01:37,522
and these are my friends Timsy, Winky and Nod.

23
00:01:37,694 --> 00:01:40,381
Unfortunately, we have to be off to the
Land of Booger Trees, so we'll be leaving now.

24
00:01:40,836 --> 00:01:43,328
Wait, don't you guys wanna come inside and play?

25
00:01:43,838 --> 00:01:45,483
Huh look dude, we're in the fourth grade, okay?

26
00:01:45,564 --> 00:01:48,137
You know what that means? It means
we don't hang out with a little kid.

27
00:01:48,446 --> 00:01:49,814
Come on, guys, let's get back to our Big Wheels.

28
00:01:50,302 --> 00:01:52,224
We have arcade games inside.

29
00:01:55,474 --> 00:01:56,174
Dad?

30
00:01:56,418 --> 00:01:59,154
Whoa. Dude, no way.

31
00:01:59,479 --> 00:02:01,938
Oh my God, this is awesome!

32
00:02:02,296 --> 00:02:03,469
Dude, are these all your toys?

33
00:02:03,786 --> 00:02:07,531
No, this is all my dad's stuff.
He loves toys and video games.

34
00:02:07,807 --> 00:02:09,859
Dude, he must be loaded!
What does he do?

35
00:02:10,159 --> 00:02:11,168
He's retired now.

36
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:14,376
Oh my God, dude! Your dad must
be the coolest dad in the world!

37
00:02:14,799 --> 00:02:16,998
Come on, my dad's probably out in the back yard.

38
00:02:19,823 --> 00:02:22,998
Oh, kick ass! Dude, why isn't my house like this?!

39
00:02:23,089 --> 00:02:24,698
Dad, you out here??

40
00:02:25,137 --> 00:02:26,546
Here I am, Blanket!

41
00:02:37,419 --> 00:02:40,225
Blanket!! Oh my beautiful blanket!

42
00:02:40,413 --> 00:02:41,470
What's wrong with his face?

43
00:02:41,646 --> 00:02:43,654
Be cool, dude. I, I think maybe he's
a burn victim or something.

44
00:02:43,866 --> 00:02:45,087
Guys, this is my dad,

45
00:02:45,252 --> 00:02:46,273
Michael Ja-
Jefferson!

46
00:02:46,555 --> 00:02:47,706
Michael ...Jefferson, yeh.

47
00:02:48,070 --> 00:02:49,490
Hey, you wanna play with me?

48
00:02:50,289 --> 00:02:51,944
Come on, let's climb the tree!

49
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:55,568
Come on, climb the tree, climb the tree!

50
00:02:58,528 --> 00:03:02,532
Have you been up my ...Wishing Tree? Tuh!

51
00:03:02,591 --> 00:03:05,819
It's where I come to think and dream.

52
00:03:05,913 --> 00:03:09,964
And now I'd like to show you my
...Wishing Tree. Jam on!

53
00:03:10,010 --> 00:03:13,310
Where we can laugh and giggle and scream. Hee hee!

54
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:15,647
Imagination is the key.
Mr. Jefferson, your son can't get up.

55
00:03:15,767 --> 00:03:18,526
Won't you imagine along with me?

56
00:03:18,562 --> 00:03:18,996
Mr. Jefferson?

57
00:03:19,055 --> 00:03:24,104
We can be spacemen, or pirates on the sea Chuckajam on

58
00:03:24,279 --> 00:03:30,690
Yes we can do everything, and I mean,
everything! Chuckajam on

59
00:03:30,812 --> 00:03:36,812
Up in my Wishing Tree! Hee hee!
Ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooh!

60
00:03:40,256 --> 00:03:43,262
Hey you guys! You guys! You gotta
come with us over to the Jeffersons!

61
00:03:43,473 --> 00:03:44,553
The Jeffersons?

62
00:03:44,788 --> 00:03:46,056
They're a new family that just moved to South Park!

63
00:03:46,238 --> 00:03:49,221
We met this kid named Blanket, and
he has the coolest dad in the world!

64
00:03:49,467 --> 00:03:52,497
Mr. Jefferson said we can invite
all the kids in town to go play over at their house.

65
00:03:52,579 --> 00:03:54,927
They have like, video games and rides
and a cotton-candy machine

66
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:57,111
oh, and, and in their back yard,
guess what they have in their back yard??

67
00:03:57,346 --> 00:03:58,908
Guess.
A train.

68
00:04:00,058 --> 00:04:00,575
No way.

69
00:04:00,951 --> 00:04:01,843
Yeah way, Craig!

70
00:04:01,937 --> 00:04:04,192
And if you don't believe in Mr. Jefferson,
then you can just not come!

71
00:04:05,307 --> 00:04:06,481
I believe in Mr. Jefferson.

72
00:04:10,151 --> 00:04:13,779
Weeeeeee, look at us on the swing!
We're swinging!

73
00:04:13,884 --> 00:04:15,763
Who wants the first cotton candy?

74
00:04:15,907 --> 00:04:17,880
Memememememememememe...

75
00:04:17,962 --> 00:04:19,970
Mememe! I'm first! I'm first!

76
00:04:21,062 --> 00:04:23,492
Ooooh, let's go ride the choo-choo train!

77
00:04:23,579 --> 00:04:25,317
Choo-choo train! Yay!

78
00:04:29,352 --> 00:04:31,371
Let's ride the train! The train!

79
00:04:31,782 --> 00:04:34,295
Would you like to ride the train with me,

80
00:04:34,354 --> 00:04:37,348
and start a magical journey?

81
00:04:38,144 --> 00:04:40,551
Yes I would, Mr. Jefferson.

82
00:04:40,739 --> 00:04:43,863
You're so awesome, Mr. Jefferson.

83
00:04:43,994 --> 00:04:46,753
Cartman, you have a beautiful voice.

84
00:04:46,929 --> 00:04:49,078
Thank you Mr. Jefferson. So do you.

85
00:04:49,172 --> 00:04:51,802
Let's ride and ride on the train together

86
00:04:51,849 --> 00:04:53,399
... Train together

87
00:04:53,452 --> 00:04:55,072
On a journey through both of our minds.

88
00:04:55,119 --> 00:04:56,963
... I've got time. Do youuu??

89
00:04:58,468 --> 00:04:59,466
Dude, what happened to your knee?

90
00:05:00,029 --> 00:05:01,297
I fell down.

91
00:05:02,178 --> 00:05:03,000
Mr. Jefferson!

92
00:05:03,714 --> 00:05:06,885
Choo-choo train, it's all fun and games.

93
00:05:06,955 --> 00:05:08,881
Choo-choo train.

94
00:05:08,975 --> 00:05:12,532
Mr.! Goddamnit. Here, come on.
We need to clean that up.

95
00:05:13,263 --> 00:05:14,849
Alright, this is gonna sting for a second.

96
00:05:15,858 --> 00:05:17,502
- Ow!
- I know, I know. Be cool.

97
00:05:18,336 --> 00:05:20,449
Thank you. That already feels better.

98
00:05:20,945 --> 00:05:23,692
So, dude, do you have any brothers or sisters?

99
00:05:23,962 --> 00:05:26,088
I have a half-brother and a half-sister.

100
00:05:26,369 --> 00:05:28,224
But they live with their mom now.

101
00:05:28,599 --> 00:05:29,562
And where is your mom?

102
00:05:29,950 --> 00:05:31,194
I don't have a mom.

103
00:05:31,688 --> 00:05:32,533
You must have a mom.

104
00:05:33,026 --> 00:05:34,470
You mean she doesn't live here,
or she's dead, or what?

105
00:05:34,893 --> 00:05:37,147
No. I was made in a laboratory.

106
00:05:37,558 --> 00:05:37,887
What?

107
00:05:38,304 --> 00:05:41,533
My daddy wanted to have a baby,
so he put me in a test tube.

108
00:05:42,090 --> 00:05:46,657
Then, they put me in a woman's tummy,
and, when I was born

109
00:05:46,951 --> 00:05:47,996
Daddy took me home.

110
00:05:48,747 --> 00:05:50,039
So you never met your mom?

111
00:05:50,441 --> 00:05:55,302
Noo... But I used to have a lot of
bodyguards and nannies, if that counts.

112
00:05:55,749 --> 00:05:57,298
Yeah. Yeah, that counts.

113
00:05:58,533 --> 00:05:59,966
Oh man, that was great!

114
00:06:00,166 --> 00:06:01,340
You guys know what Mr. Jefferson said?

115
00:06:01,516 --> 00:06:02,843
He said I'm his best friend,

116
00:06:02,995 --> 00:06:04,663
and I can go over to his house whenever I want!

117
00:06:04,893 --> 00:06:06,677
I'm supposed to go right back
over there after dinner tonight!

118
00:06:06,901 --> 00:06:09,308
You guys, I feel kinda bad for that kid.

119
00:06:09,543 --> 00:06:12,056
You feel bad for him?!
He has everything a kid could want!

120
00:06:12,291 --> 00:06:15,215
Mr. Jefferson just seems like he wants
to be a kid, not have one.

121
00:06:15,508 --> 00:06:17,140
Oh, you know what?! This makes perfect sense!

122
00:06:17,518 --> 00:06:20,019
A guy moves into South Park with
a FERRIS wheel in his back yard,

123
00:06:20,137 --> 00:06:21,569
and KYLE has to see a problem with it!

124
00:06:21,898 --> 00:06:24,305
Mr. Jefferson is the best thing that's
happened to this town in a long time,

125
00:06:24,447 --> 00:06:26,502
and if you miss this up, so help me GOD,

126
00:06:26,549 --> 00:06:28,275
I will rip your balls off with my bare hands!

127
00:06:28,439 --> 00:06:30,224
With my bare hands, Goddamn you!

128
00:06:35,836 --> 00:06:37,891
Well, there he is. Where have you been all afternoon.

129
00:06:38,044 --> 00:06:39,653
I was over at the new neighbors, the Jeffersons.

130
00:06:39,843 --> 00:06:41,287
Oh, are they nice people?

131
00:06:41,533 --> 00:06:42,895
Yeah. It's just a dad and his son.

132
00:06:43,201 --> 00:06:45,349
Well, we're supposed to have the Broflovskis and the Stotches

133
00:06:45,385 --> 00:06:46,406
over for dinner tonight.

134
00:06:46,535 --> 00:06:48,343
Maybe I'll invite Mr. Jefferson too.

135
00:06:52,276 --> 00:06:55,129
So, Mr. Jefferson, did I hear you say
you moved here from Kentucky?

136
00:06:55,517 --> 00:06:56,444
Kentucky, yeh.

137
00:06:57,008 --> 00:06:58,852
I heard people saying you all were from Illinois.

138
00:06:59,081 --> 00:07:01,652
No, theh, they're ignorant. That's ignorant.

139
00:07:02,204 --> 00:07:04,282
What kind of work do you do, Mr. Jefferson?

140
00:07:04,668 --> 00:07:07,838
Oh I'm retired now, but, I was in... pharmaceuticals

141
00:07:08,450 --> 00:07:10,681
Well our boys have really taken a liking to you.

142
00:07:10,728 --> 00:07:12,336
You seem to really have a way with them.

143
00:07:12,512 --> 00:07:14,638
I just id- identify so much with children.

144
00:07:14,769 --> 00:07:16,190
Their innocence, their beauty.

145
00:07:16,577 --> 00:07:18,597
I think that God is in the face of every child.

146
00:07:20,735 --> 00:07:21,921
....Yeeeah.

147
00:07:23,564 --> 00:07:24,562
...They are fun.

148
00:07:26,455 --> 00:07:27,782
Boys, you okay out there?

149
00:07:28,052 --> 00:07:28,651
Fine Mom.

150
00:07:29,132 --> 00:07:30,177
Wow, these are great.

151
00:07:30,318 --> 00:07:31,539
What are they called again?

152
00:07:31,886 --> 00:07:32,872
They're TV dinners.

153
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:34,551
Don't you wanna take that veil off so you can eat?

154
00:07:34,868 --> 00:07:36,371
Nah, I'm not supposed to.

155
00:07:36,629 --> 00:07:38,696
Dad says I have to keep my face hidden.

156
00:07:43,474 --> 00:07:44,272
What the hell is going on?!

157
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:45,693
Are you having Mr. Jefferson over for dinner?!

158
00:07:45,975 --> 00:07:46,773
No, my parents are.

159
00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:48,887
You guys better not be trying to Bogart my friend away!

160
00:07:49,098 --> 00:07:49,368
What?

161
00:07:49,672 --> 00:07:50,670
He is MY friend, got it?!

162
00:07:50,905 --> 00:07:53,065
I was friends with him before you assholes were,
and I hoowi-

163
00:07:53,582 --> 00:07:55,061
Stan! Stan, I'm serisouslih!

164
00:07:55,343 --> 00:07:57,550
You'd better not be talking bad
about me in there to Mr. Jefferson!

165
00:07:58,094 --> 00:08:00,266
Hey, you know Kobe Bryant was up in Eagle today.

166
00:08:00,524 --> 00:08:02,344
Oh yeah? What do you think, Mr. Jefferson?

167
00:08:02,426 --> 00:08:03,718
Do you think Kobe's guilty or innocent?

168
00:08:05,055 --> 00:08:06,522
I think he's definitely going to jail.

169
00:08:06,616 --> 00:08:08,929
I just love seeing smug celebrities get their comeuppance.

170
00:08:09,533 --> 00:08:12,257
think it's wrong what the police do
to wealthy black men.

171
00:08:12,621 --> 00:08:14,911
Oh come on, Mr. Jefferson, you're
not one of those who think

172
00:08:15,146 --> 00:08:18,105
that the police go around framing rich
black people just because they're jealous..

173
00:08:18,523 --> 00:08:20,988
Yeah! Because their hearts are full of greed and

174
00:08:21,129 --> 00:08:22,667
they have... doodoo in their soul.

175
00:08:27,871 --> 00:08:29,045
Hey Sergeant, take a look at this.

176
00:08:29,797 --> 00:08:30,266
Whatcha got?

177
00:08:30,442 --> 00:08:32,356
Looks like a new family has just moved into South Park.

178
00:08:32,769 --> 00:08:36,386
One Mr. Jefferson, age 50, bought
a house there and paid cash.

179
00:08:37,045 --> 00:08:38,055
He seems to have a lot of money.

180
00:08:38,407 --> 00:08:39,194
So, what's the problem?

181
00:08:39,523 --> 00:08:40,697
Take a look. Says here...

182
00:08:41,178 --> 00:08:41,860
He's black.

183
00:08:42,447 --> 00:08:45,699
By God, so he is. Black and rich.

184
00:08:46,249 --> 00:08:49,055
Time to take this Mr. Jefferson
down, just like we did Kobe.

185
00:08:49,196 --> 00:08:51,498
Let's go people!
We've got another rich black guy.

186
00:08:51,652 --> 00:08:55,057
I want him humiliated and dragged through
the dirt, and I want it done by the books!

187
00:09:03,319 --> 00:09:03,730
Kyle?

188
00:09:04,634 --> 00:09:06,560
Hey, Stan, whatcha doin'?

189
00:09:06,841 --> 00:09:08,004
Mr. Jefferson- Awww!

190
00:09:08,310 --> 00:09:09,602
It's 1:30 in the morning!

191
00:09:09,790 --> 00:09:12,819
Look at me, I'm Peter Pan.
T-shamon!

192
00:09:12,989 --> 00:09:15,913
I'm a little boy forever.
Hey!

193
00:09:16,517 --> 00:09:18,395
Mr. Jefferson, I have to go to school tomorrow!

194
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:20,709
Oh, son of a bitch! I knew it!

195
00:09:21,190 --> 00:09:22,247
What the hell are you doing, Stan?!

196
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:23,304
I'll tell you what you're doing!

197
00:09:23,421 --> 00:09:24,771
You're trying to steal MY best friend!

198
00:09:25,086 --> 00:09:25,967
He just showed up here.

199
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:28,726
Remember, Mr. Jefferson?
You said we were best friends.

200
00:09:29,771 --> 00:09:30,617
Jesus Christ!

201
00:09:32,478 --> 00:09:34,427
Dude, look who I found prowling around in my back yard.

202
00:09:34,521 --> 00:09:35,413
Hi Stan.

203
00:09:35,971 --> 00:09:37,427
He was out all alone in the middle of the night.

204
00:09:37,592 --> 00:09:38,871
Mr. Jefferson isn't even home.

205
00:09:39,329 --> 00:09:41,220
I know. He's here.
What??

206
00:09:41,535 --> 00:09:44,388
Oh Kyle, Blanket, yay, it's a slumber party!

207
00:09:44,706 --> 00:09:46,855
No! Mr. Jefferson, you need to take your son home.

208
00:09:47,148 --> 00:09:49,039
We can't go home.
There's a ghost in our house.

209
00:09:49,168 --> 00:09:50,518
Me and Blanket are scared.

210
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,479
Dad says it wants to eat us.

211
00:09:52,884 --> 00:09:54,235
Please don't make us go back home.

212
00:09:54,293 --> 00:09:56,383
Please! We're scared, we're scared!

213
00:09:56,466 --> 00:09:57,311
We're scared!

214
00:09:57,370 --> 00:09:58,180
Hee hee!

215
00:09:58,799 --> 00:10:01,430
Okay, fine, we'll all stay here,
but we're going to sleep now!

216
00:10:01,876 --> 00:10:02,533
Come on, Blanket.

217
00:10:07,305 --> 00:10:10,235
Now let's all sleep and dream Heehee!

218
00:10:10,545 --> 00:10:13,307
of fun and adventurous things shamon!

219
00:10:13,617 --> 00:10:16,463
It's time for us all to say goodnight

220
00:10:24,165 --> 00:10:27,659
Mr. Jefferson, I wish I could be around you
all the time. You're awesome.

221
00:10:27,988 --> 00:10:29,651
I think you're awesome too, Cartman.

222
00:10:30,017 --> 00:10:30,440
Yeah?

223
00:10:30,834 --> 00:10:31,144
Yeah.

224
00:10:32,046 --> 00:10:32,525
Yeah?

225
00:10:32,891 --> 00:10:33,399
Yeah.

226
00:10:33,962 --> 00:10:34,469
Yeah?

227
00:10:36,583 --> 00:10:37,231
Haaa!

228
00:10:39,683 --> 00:10:41,373
What's the matter, Stan?
Did you have a bad dream?

229
00:10:42,388 --> 00:10:45,121
Yeah. A really bad dream. Oh Jesus!

230
00:10:49,574 --> 00:10:50,729
Murphy, you inside?

231
00:10:51,523 --> 00:10:52,452
We're inside, sir.

232
00:10:53,157 --> 00:10:56,229
Harris was right. This guy looks like
he has more money than all of us put together.

233
00:10:56,623 --> 00:10:57,863
Black sonofabitch!

234
00:10:58,821 --> 00:11:01,019
I'm planting the cocaine now.

235
00:11:01,123 --> 00:11:02,532
Johnson, what about you?

236
00:11:02,616 --> 00:11:04,420
Placing the blood spatter now, sir.

237
00:11:04,984 --> 00:11:05,744
Frakes?

238
00:11:05,913 --> 00:11:08,224
Placing pubic hair from the raped girl now, sir.

239
00:11:08,365 --> 00:11:10,253
All right, when this Jefferson guy shows up,

240
00:11:10,366 --> 00:11:12,057
arrest him fast and try not to beat him.

241
00:11:12,141 --> 00:11:14,029
There could be neighbors with video cameras.

242
00:11:15,636 --> 00:11:17,975
Why do we do it, Harris?

243
00:11:18,425 --> 00:11:18,961
Sir?

244
00:11:19,435 --> 00:11:22,084
Why is it that us policement around
the country have such a passion

245
00:11:22,225 --> 00:11:25,353
for framing wealthy African-Americans
with crimes they didn't commit?

246
00:11:25,888 --> 00:11:29,439
Oh why? I guess I never thought
about why, sir. We just do it.

247
00:11:29,598 --> 00:11:31,965
Twenty-five years I've been on the force.

248
00:11:32,078 --> 00:11:35,262
I've seen every kind of sick,
depraved act known to humanity and still,

249
00:11:35,403 --> 00:11:38,897
when I see a black man walk
by who has more money than me, I...

250
00:11:39,010 --> 00:11:41,462
want to vomit my gizzards right in the gutter.

251
00:11:41,828 --> 00:11:44,730
But why? Maybe there is no reason.

252
00:11:44,871 --> 00:11:47,915
Maybe there's just a big blue ball
out there that's mostly covered

253
00:11:48,027 --> 00:11:50,169
with water and we're just goin' along for the ride.

254
00:11:55,819 --> 00:11:57,481
Stan, time to get up for school.

255
00:11:57,989 --> 00:11:59,736
Stan? What the-?

256
00:12:00,835 --> 00:12:02,357
Mr. Jefferson?!

257
00:12:02,497 --> 00:12:04,752
Oh oh, we were just having a slumber party.

258
00:12:05,090 --> 00:12:07,175
Mr. Jefferson, this is highly inappropriate!

259
00:12:07,598 --> 00:12:09,937
Inappropriate?
No, you're being ignorant.

260
00:12:10,097 --> 00:12:11,224
They're my friends.

261
00:12:11,646 --> 00:12:15,423
You see, I I didn't have a childhood,
so I'm really just a child myself.

262
00:12:15,733 --> 00:12:18,635
Here, everything's okay.
I want you each to have a hundred dollars.

263
00:12:18,917 --> 00:12:22,242
Wow, I'm gonna go buy that
new sport coat I've been wanting.

264
00:12:23,825 --> 00:12:26,107
Come on, Blanket.
We have to go home and feed the animals.

265
00:12:26,277 --> 00:12:27,122
Bye, friends.

266
00:12:29,151 --> 00:12:31,603
Boys, I do not want you going over
to Mr. Jefferson's anymore.

267
00:12:31,743 --> 00:12:32,533
Do you understand?

268
00:12:32,702 --> 00:12:34,674
You don't have to tell us twice, Mom.
That guy's a freak!

269
00:12:35,097 --> 00:12:36,562
Not go to Mr. Jefferson's anymore?

270
00:12:36,985 --> 00:12:41,015
Well, excuse my French, Mrs. Marsh,
but you can suck my fat hairy balls!

271
00:12:45,133 --> 00:12:46,373
Come on, Blanket!

272
00:12:49,811 --> 00:12:51,305
Hey Harris Harris Harris! Harris!

273
00:12:51,474 --> 00:12:52,094
What what what?

274
00:12:52,291 --> 00:12:53,841
It's Jefferson! He's back!

275
00:12:54,038 --> 00:12:57,420
All right, people.
Let's give Blacky a nice welcome home.

276
00:13:01,402 --> 00:13:03,713
Whoa, wait a minute! That guy isn't black!

277
00:13:04,953 --> 00:13:08,363
Holy God, his son isn't black either!
Oh Jesus !

278
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:12,759
This is Yeats! Stand down! I repeat,
stand down! Suspect is not black!

279
00:13:13,041 --> 00:13:15,549
You son of a bitch, you told my
this guy was African-American!

280
00:13:15,661 --> 00:13:17,521
It says right here on the final sheet he is!

281
00:13:17,662 --> 00:13:19,691
Does that look like a black guy to you?!

282
00:13:19,973 --> 00:13:21,494
It said on the final sheet!

283
00:13:21,692 --> 00:13:23,270
Jesus Christ Monkeyballs!

284
00:13:23,439 --> 00:13:28,596
We could have made an innocent man
go to jail who wasn't black! Oh!

285
00:13:32,968 --> 00:13:38,040
Jesus, Harris. What are we becoming? We're supposed to...

286
00:13:38,238 --> 00:13:41,394
protect the people.
Where have we lost our way?

287
00:13:41,478 --> 00:13:44,325
Sir, it's possible that he is black,
even though he doesn't look it.

288
00:13:44,466 --> 00:13:48,439
To hell with you!! I'm never gonna
frame an innocent man again!

289
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:51,055
Unless I KNOW he's black for sure!!

290
00:13:51,590 --> 00:13:53,225
All the adults are trying to get us.

291
00:13:53,619 --> 00:13:55,677
Get up to your room, Blanket,
and put your mask on!

292
00:13:55,874 --> 00:13:57,677
We can't go outside anymore!

293
00:14:10,142 --> 00:14:11,072
That poor kid.

294
00:14:11,184 --> 00:14:13,777
Dude, come on. We're not supposed to go over there.

295
00:14:15,806 --> 00:14:17,130
Hi guys!

296
00:14:17,468 --> 00:14:18,032
Hey Blanket.

297
00:14:19,009 --> 00:14:21,771
Uh, look, we're goin' over to help my
dad chop wood. You... wanna come with?

298
00:14:22,053 --> 00:14:23,603
Really? You mean it?

299
00:14:23,715 --> 00:14:27,801
Oh yay, my friends are here!
Come inside and play, guys!

300
00:14:28,055 --> 00:14:31,775
Ah, actually, Mr. Jefferson, we were seeing
if Blanket wanted to chop wood with us

301
00:14:31,967 --> 00:14:34,080
Chop wood? No, that's ignorant.

302
00:14:34,447 --> 00:14:36,899
That's poopie work.
Blanket and me wanna play!

303
00:14:37,124 --> 00:14:40,449
Mr. Jefferson, ih it might be good
for Blanket to learn how to chop wood

304
00:14:40,590 --> 00:14:42,873
Blanket likes to play, don't you Blanket?

305
00:14:43,605 --> 00:14:45,662
Wee, look! He can fly!

306
00:14:45,770 --> 00:14:47,236
Jesus Christ, dude!

307
00:14:47,348 --> 00:14:47,968
Aaaaaah!!

308
00:14:48,109 --> 00:14:50,138
Stop, you fucking lunatic!!

309
00:14:54,017 --> 00:14:55,905
Dude, we have got to get that kid away from him!

310
00:14:56,807 --> 00:14:59,259
No, Blanket, shhhh. Stop crying.

311
00:14:59,710 --> 00:15:01,739
It's okay, Blanket. Here, look.

312
00:15:02,105 --> 00:15:07,741
Jeekabee durtah! Ow!
There, Blanket, shhhh.

313
00:15:08,037 --> 00:15:11,814
Hey, hey look, hey look. I got your nose.

314
00:15:11,955 --> 00:15:17,252
Look! Lookit, I got your nose.
I got your nose, Blanket. See?

315
00:15:17,929 --> 00:15:19,000
I got your nose.

316
00:15:25,771 --> 00:15:29,970
Aaaaaaaa!

317
00:15:30,308 --> 00:15:31,886
No, Blanket, stop!

318
00:15:31,999 --> 00:15:34,084
It's ignorant. You're being ignorant!

319
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:38,565
Harrison, why haven't you called?
You know how I worry.

320
00:15:39,269 --> 00:15:42,341
I'm givin' up, Maggie.
I'm quitting the force.

321
00:15:42,566 --> 00:15:44,680
Quitting the force? You?

322
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:46,676
None of it makes sense anymore.

323
00:15:47,099 --> 00:15:49,015
I don't even know if what we're doing is right.

324
00:15:49,550 --> 00:15:51,917
The last thirteen hours we've been working on a case,

325
00:15:52,030 --> 00:15:54,397
trying to get a real scumbag off the streets.

326
00:15:54,566 --> 00:15:58,286
And when he walked up to the door,
I could have sworn he was white.

327
00:15:58,652 --> 00:16:02,288
Maybe I can't tell the difference anymore.
Maybe it doesn't matter.

328
00:16:02,917 --> 00:16:05,284
Because it seems like every time we frame a rich black guy,

329
00:16:05,481 --> 00:16:08,863
he's back out on the streets in no time.
It's just like OJ.

330
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:11,652
Do you know how hard those cops worked to frame him?

331
00:16:11,822 --> 00:16:13,710
The tireless hours they put in??

332
00:16:13,963 --> 00:16:16,302
And then he just gets off because somebody messed up

333
00:16:16,387 --> 00:16:18,528
and said the N word out loud too many times.

334
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:23,206
I guess I'm just tired. I'm jast damn tired.

335
00:16:23,469 --> 00:16:26,203
Not another word of that kind of talk, Harrison Yeats.

336
00:16:26,653 --> 00:16:29,105
Believe me I would love nothin' more
than to have you quit the force

337
00:16:29,218 --> 00:16:31,162
and no longer have to worry about
whether or not you're comin' home.

338
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:35,558
But I know you. Framin' rich black men for
crimes they didn't commit is in your blood.

339
00:16:36,347 --> 00:16:38,714
Wipin' that rich, smug smile off their faces is

340
00:16:38,771 --> 00:16:40,405
the only thing that puts a smile on yours.

341
00:16:40,574 --> 00:16:42,660
You're a good cop, Harrsion Yeats.

342
00:16:42,744 --> 00:16:45,731
You don't have to question that.
Because I'm here to tell you.

343
00:16:46,774 --> 00:16:48,493
And you're a good wife, Maggie.

344
00:16:48,831 --> 00:16:50,324
You know me better than I know myself.

345
00:16:51,423 --> 00:16:52,297
Where're you goin'?

346
00:16:52,663 --> 00:16:54,270
Think I've got a little more work to do.

347
00:17:01,075 --> 00:17:04,316
Mr. Jefferson? It's your best friend
in the whole wide world, Eric Cartman.

348
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:07,810
Mr. Jefferson? I came to sleep over tonight, remember?

349
00:17:08,651 --> 00:17:11,807
No, Dr. Nelson, I'm telling you,
you have to fly out here right now!

350
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:13,216
My nose came off again!

351
00:17:14,371 --> 00:17:16,992
I know you live in California;
I'll pay for your plane ticket!

352
00:17:17,978 --> 00:17:19,303
But I'm falling apart!

353
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:21,303
I need some more of that cream and the injections!

354
00:17:21,416 --> 00:17:22,712
I have to look young again!

355
00:17:24,375 --> 00:17:25,728
Oh, I'm melting!

356
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:28,553
All right. Thanks a lot for helping us, dude.

357
00:17:28,797 --> 00:17:29,692
Yeah, sure, whatever.

358
00:17:29,980 --> 00:17:31,017
You just gotta pretend you're Blanket

359
00:17:31,044 --> 00:17:32,488
until we can get the real Blanket somewhere safe.

360
00:17:32,835 --> 00:17:33,731
Aren't I too big to be Blanket?

361
00:17:34,095 --> 00:17:36,163
I don't think Mr. Jefferson pays enough 
attention to his son to notice.

362
00:17:36,228 --> 00:17:36,522
Come on!

363
00:17:41,683 --> 00:17:42,465
Blanket, you in here?

364
00:17:43,009 --> 00:17:44,083
Hi guys!

365
00:17:44,181 --> 00:17:46,477
Shh, Blanket, we're gonna take you 
away for a little while, okay?

366
00:17:46,786 --> 00:17:49,961
You are? Oh thank you thank you thank you!

367
00:17:50,075 --> 00:17:50,906
All right dude, get in his bed.

368
00:17:51,183 --> 00:17:52,599
All right, but you guys owe me for this.

369
00:17:53,006 --> 00:17:54,472
Dude, whatever. At least you finally 
get to do something.

370
00:17:57,424 --> 00:17:59,134
Santa Barbara Police Department, this is Snetzl.

371
00:17:59,485 --> 00:18:03,181
Hello, this is Sergeant Yeats over at the 
Park County Police Department in Colorado.

372
00:18:03,425 --> 00:18:05,037
Yes, sergeant. What can I do for you?

373
00:18:05,347 --> 00:18:08,424
Well, we've been trying to frame 
this guy who just moved into our town

374
00:18:08,489 --> 00:18:10,655
and the fil-o-fax says he moved from yoru area.

375
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:12,332
One Martin Jefferson?

376
00:18:12,715 --> 00:18:16,037
Hm. No, we never had a any rich 
African-Americans named Jefferson here.

377
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:17,926
If we had, we would have framed him ourselves.

378
00:18:18,479 --> 00:18:20,743
Well, he doesn't really look that black.

379
00:18:21,011 --> 00:18:21,662
Yeah, I don't uh... 

380
00:18:22,150 --> 00:18:22,834
Hold on a second.

381
00:18:23,290 --> 00:18:25,407
There was oine we framed a couple of times,

382
00:18:25,716 --> 00:18:27,914
but the black bastard was so rich he made bail

383
00:18:27,963 --> 00:18:29,038
and disappeared before the trial.

384
00:18:29,452 --> 00:18:30,689
You say he disappeared?

385
00:18:30,950 --> 00:18:31,845
What did you frame him for?

386
00:18:32,290 --> 00:18:34,896
We uhhh found some kids 
that had stayed over at his place,

387
00:18:34,961 --> 00:18:37,371
and we asked them to lie and make 
up some false molestation charges.

388
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:38,689
Molestation, nice.

389
00:18:38,901 --> 00:18:40,546
Yeah, it was a lot of work. Took years,

390
00:18:40,692 --> 00:18:42,076
but we were finally able to arrest him.

391
00:18:42,555 --> 00:18:45,225
Then we planted some evidence, 
took embarassing photos of his penis,

392
00:18:45,274 --> 00:18:47,521
and threw him in a dirty prison cell 
with doodie feces on the walls.

393
00:18:47,814 --> 00:18:49,394
You should have seen him squirm!

394
00:18:49,768 --> 00:18:52,048
That's damn fine police work, sergeant. 
Damn fine.

395
00:18:52,303 --> 00:18:55,381
Heh yeah, but the point is this 
guy didn't really look black either.

396
00:18:55,657 --> 00:18:58,719
We had to sneak in while he was 
asleep and get a DNA sample to be sure.

397
00:18:59,419 --> 00:19:02,366
Jesus Christ Monkeyballs! 
It must be the same guy!

398
00:19:04,050 --> 00:19:06,003
Mr. Jefferson, hello??

399
00:19:06,411 --> 00:19:08,576
Come on, Blanket! We gotta go 
before your dad sees us.

400
00:19:10,337 --> 00:19:12,193
What are you doing with my Blanket?

401
00:19:18,633 --> 00:19:20,555
Come on, Blanket, play with me.

402
00:19:20,604 --> 00:19:22,389
Jeechabee durtah! Hee!

403
00:19:22,538 --> 00:19:24,428
HAAAAA! 
Go go RUUN!

404
00:19:26,224 --> 00:19:27,504
HAAAAA!

405
00:19:27,749 --> 00:19:31,142
Wuchatennah! Jamonah! Heehee!

406
00:19:31,213 --> 00:19:33,960
Oh Jesus!
What the hell is going on, you guys?

407
00:19:34,066 --> 00:19:36,837
My Blanket! Let's play, Blanket!

408
00:19:37,208 --> 00:19:38,511
Nonono wait, I'm not Blanket!

409
00:19:38,934 --> 00:19:41,071
Wee, he can fly! He can fly!

410
00:19:41,341 --> 00:19:42,304
Aaaah! Aaaah, stop!

411
00:19:45,132 --> 00:19:46,635
Oh my God, they killed Kenny!

412
00:19:46,917 --> 00:19:47,809
You bastard!

413
00:19:48,225 --> 00:19:51,701
Blanket? Blanket! Come play!

414
00:19:51,759 --> 00:19:52,992
Nooo!
Come on!

415
00:19:55,882 --> 00:19:56,880
Run Blanket Run!

416
00:19:59,522 --> 00:20:00,308
Hang on, Blanket!

417
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:02,914
Heehee!

418
00:20:03,184 --> 00:20:05,509
Freeze, Jefferson! The gig is up!

419
00:20:05,814 --> 00:20:08,163
You are wanted for child mo-les-tation!

420
00:20:08,914 --> 00:20:12,378
No! I am sick and tired of 
people harassing Mr. Jefferson!

421
00:20:12,561 --> 00:20:15,567
All I've been hearing since Mr. Jefferson 
moved here are sick lies!

422
00:20:15,649 --> 00:20:19,665
That he molests children, that he's a 
bad father, that he has plastic surgery!


423
00:20:19,825 --> 00:20:21,351
It's ignorant.

424
00:20:22,666 --> 00:20:24,603
Sure, maybe Mr. Jefferson's a little different.

425
00:20:24,885 --> 00:20:26,764
But that's because he had to work 
all the time when he was young

426
00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:28,032
and missed out on his childhood.

427
00:20:28,149 --> 00:20:30,756
What's wrong with wanting to have 
the innocence and beauty of a child.

428
00:20:33,053 --> 00:20:36,622
All right, let's just say all the bad things 
said about Mr. Jefferson are lies!

429
00:20:36,890 --> 00:20:39,368
Let's say the police department does 
just go around spending their time 

430
00:20:39,579 --> 00:20:40,941
framing people for crimes they didn't commit!

431
00:20:41,352 --> 00:20:42,233
Let's say it's all made up,

432
00:20:42,397 --> 00:20:43,994
and Mr. Jefferson is just a nice guy

433
00:20:44,170 --> 00:20:46,166
who's trying to be a child because 
he never got to have a childhood.

434
00:20:46,528 --> 00:20:48,783
Well that's fine, except for that 
he HAS children now!

435
00:20:49,194 --> 00:20:51,260
And when people have children, 
they have to grow up!

436
00:20:53,872 --> 00:20:56,573
You're right. I've been so 
obsessed with my childhood 

437
00:20:56,620 --> 00:20:57,829
that I've forgotten about his.

438
00:20:58,149 --> 00:21:00,685
I thought having lots of rides 
and toys was enough, but...

439
00:21:01,108 --> 00:21:02,247
Blanket doesn't need a playmate.

440
00:21:02,799 --> 00:21:05,816
He needs a father, and a normal life. 
Chickuckoo gainuh.

441
00:21:06,214 --> 00:21:08,773
Blanket, I wanna give away all my money.

442
00:21:08,985 --> 00:21:10,500
I I wanna get a normal job and...

443
00:21:10,711 --> 00:21:13,036
take a shot at raising you in a normal setting.

444
00:21:16,287 --> 00:21:19,739
Look everybody! I'm a normal little boy.

445
00:21:20,041 --> 00:21:22,260
Well, if you're gonna give away 
all your money, then,

446
00:21:22,377 --> 00:21:24,256
I guess we can drop all those charges.

447
00:21:24,779 --> 00:21:27,421
No point in putting another poor black man in jail.

448
00:21:27,843 --> 00:21:29,781
All right! Things just might work out!

449
00:21:30,276 --> 00:21:31,427
Things can always work out,

450
00:21:31,474 --> 00:21:33,728
as long as we know we have the power to change.

451
00:21:35,726 --> 00:21:41,116
We all have the power to change 
if we search inside our hearts

452
00:21:41,392 --> 00:21:46,135
And we start to heal the wounds of all our yesterdays

453
00:21:46,182 --> 00:21:49,047
And you know it might be hard, 

454
00:21:49,212 --> 00:21:52,711
but all you've got to do is start,

455
00:21:52,859 --> 00:22:01,066
And you can change all of your evil molesting ways.

456
00:22:06,111 --> 00:22:07,779
Jejabee durtah!
