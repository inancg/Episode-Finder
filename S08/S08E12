4
00:00:36,745 --> 00:00:38,000
Come on, Wendy, we'er gonna miss it.

5
00:00:38,372 --> 00:00:39,414
We're gonna miss what?

6
00:00:39,456 --> 00:00:41,500
Paris Hilton is making an appearance at the mall.

7
00:00:41,834 --> 00:00:42,876
Who's Paris Hilton?

8
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
"Who's Paris Hilton?"

9
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:44,837
You don't know?

10
00:00:45,587 --> 00:00:51,000
Hello, everyone! The Guess Clothing Company
is pleased to have as its new spokesperson model,

11
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
a woman all you young ones can look up to...

12
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,346
Ms. Paris Hilton.

13
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,894
Wow, that's really her!

14
00:01:00,936 --> 00:01:02,479
Paris! Over here!

15
00:01:02,563 --> 00:01:03,856
I don't get it. What does she do?

16
00:01:03,856 --> 00:01:04,857
She's super-rich!

17
00:01:05,899 --> 00:01:07,109
...but what does she do?

18
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:09,236
She's totally spoiled and savvy.

19
00:01:09,653 --> 00:01:10,988
What does she do?!

20
00:01:11,655 --> 00:01:12,739
She's a whore.

21
00:01:13,407 --> 00:01:15,826
Hey everyone.
Sorry if I'm a little spent.

22
00:01:15,868 --> 00:01:19,371
I did a whole lot of partying last
night with a LOT of different guys.

23
00:01:22,249 --> 00:01:27,000
Anyway, I'm pleased to be here in Douth Dark
to announce the opening of my brand new store!

24
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,632
A store where girls can buy
everything they need to be just like me!

25
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,218
Stupid Spoiled Whore!

26
00:01:35,721 --> 00:01:39,683
Have fun, girls. And remember to party,
and be super-lame to everybody.

27
00:01:39,766 --> 00:01:40,100
Bye!

28
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,313
Give me that! Fucking Christ I need a drink!

29
00:01:46,148 --> 00:01:47,524
Where's my dog?!

30
00:01:51,862 --> 00:01:53,655
Wow, look at all this great stuff.

31
00:01:53,864 --> 00:01:55,000
Stupid Spoiled Whore clothes,

32
00:01:55,199 --> 00:01:56,617
Stupid Spoiled Whore dolls,

33
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:57,618
Hey, check it out:

34
00:01:57,659 --> 00:01:59,000
the new Paris Hilton perfume,

35
00:01:59,000 --> 00:01:59,786
Skanque.

36
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:03,000
Oh yeah, let's get lots of that!

37
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
You guys, don't buy this stuff.

38
00:02:04,374 --> 00:02:05,959
Why do you want to be like Paris Hilton?

39
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,338
It's not just Paris: Britney Spears,
Christina Aguilera, Tara Reid...

40
00:02:09,379 --> 00:02:11,000
they're all stupid spoiled whores!

41
00:02:11,173 --> 00:02:14,301
But the idea that we'll be whorish
for money is belittling to our gender!

42
00:02:14,426 --> 00:02:15,636
Wendy, get a clue.

43
00:02:15,886 --> 00:02:18,263
The only thing more important
than being rich is being famous!

44
00:02:18,347 --> 00:02:20,516
Wow, you really sound like a dumb slut, Bebe.

45
00:02:20,682 --> 00:02:21,892
Thanks, Annie!

46
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,853
God, get me out of this hick town!

47
00:02:24,895 --> 00:02:26,146
What a bunch of rednecks!

48
00:02:28,815 --> 00:02:30,359
Everybody's so fucking lame.

49
00:02:30,359 --> 00:02:32,000
Except for you, my little Tinkerbell.

50
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
You love my vewy much, don't you?

51
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:34,947
How much you wuv me?

52
00:02:35,781 --> 00:02:39,409
I'm gonna dress you up like a bunny,
and then I'm gonna dress you up like a little princess.

53
00:02:39,493 --> 00:02:40,661
You're mine forever!

54
00:02:42,788 --> 00:02:44,581
Whatever! Oh, hey, KC.

55
00:02:44,665 --> 00:02:48,377
Oh, another stupid store opening
at some lame cowboy town.

56
00:02:48,836 --> 00:02:51,713
Oh, it's so fucking stupid,
this whole town stinks like cows.

57
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,924
I can't wait to get out of here! Grody!

58
00:02:53,924 --> 00:02:55,884
They have the lamest stores, too...

59
00:02:56,260 --> 00:02:57,511
I'm gonna go to Rome for the weekend,

60
00:02:57,553 --> 00:03:01,014
I think. I dunno, Rome or Tokyo,
either way it'll be totally boring.

61
00:03:01,056 --> 00:03:01,640
Stupid.

62
00:03:04,768 --> 00:03:07,813
I need to get wasted.
I haven't had a drink in like fourteen minutes.

63
00:03:07,855 --> 00:03:09,565
Why is everybody so stupid anyway?

64
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,361
I flashed all these hicks with my boobs;
you should've seen the look on their faces!

65
00:03:14,403 --> 00:03:16,238
Stupid redneck idiots!

66
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:20,000
Oh dear...

67
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,494
Another dog killed itself!

68
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Hey Jessie, hey Kal. Do you guys mind
if I hang out with you?

69
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,251
The other girls are acting really strange.

70
00:03:29,418 --> 00:03:31,795
Sure, Wendy. We were just trying
to think of something to do.

71
00:03:31,837 --> 00:03:34,214
Oh, well, you wanna maybe go to the art museum?

72
00:03:34,631 --> 00:03:36,049
Nah, that sounds really dull.

73
00:03:36,341 --> 00:03:39,469
Hey, I know! Let's make a videotape
of us having sex with boys!

74
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:40,387
What??

75
00:03:40,429 --> 00:03:43,557
I just got
"the Stupid Spoiled Whore video playset"!

76
00:03:44,308 --> 00:03:47,000
..Stupid Spoiled Whore video playset!

77
00:03:47,144 --> 00:03:49,000
You can make videos that get out on the Internet!

78
00:03:49,104 --> 00:03:49,980
Yeah!

79
00:03:50,731 --> 00:03:54,000
...Stupid Spoiled Whore video playset!

80
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,570
Show the whole world what a slut you are!

81
00:03:56,570 --> 00:03:58,000
Stupid Spoiled Whore Video Playset...

82
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,657
comes with video camera, night-vision filter,

83
00:04:00,699 --> 00:04:04,411
play money, losable cellphone,
and sixteen hits of exstacy.

84
00:04:04,453 --> 00:04:07,000
Stupid Spoiled Whore Video Playset!

85
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Let everyone see your coo-oo-ooch!

86
00:04:10,459 --> 00:04:14,546
I'm pretending to be calling my friends on
the cellphone while my man waits for more sex!

87
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,757
You're a Stupid Spoiled Whore.

88
00:04:18,175 --> 00:04:19,343
Where are you goin', Wendy?

89
00:04:25,432 --> 00:04:27,726
All right, Ms. Hilton...
we'll find you another dog.

90
00:04:30,145 --> 00:04:33,106
There there now,
let's just get you back home, shall we?

91
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,029
Wait! Wait, stop the car!

92
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,782
Stop the car, you fucking moron!

93
00:04:42,866 --> 00:04:44,409
Look at how cuuute.

94
00:04:44,451 --> 00:04:46,537
I want that! I want that!

95
00:04:47,162 --> 00:04:51,000
Lu lu lu, I've got some apples,
Lu lu lu, you've got some too.

96
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,459
It's adorable!

97
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,255
Lu lu lu, let's make some applesauce,
take off our clothes and lu lu lu!

98
00:04:56,338 --> 00:04:58,215
Look at his lwittle puff ball!

99
00:04:58,632 --> 00:05:02,594
I'm gonna feed you, and take care of you,
and call you Mr. Biggles!

100
00:05:02,761 --> 00:05:04,000
My name's Butters.

101
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,850
Driver, put Mr. Biggles in the car.
I want to find a bear costume for him.

102
00:05:07,891 --> 00:05:10,143
Won't he be soo cute dressed up as a bear?

103
00:05:10,227 --> 00:05:12,479
Paris, I believe this is somebody's child.

104
00:05:12,896 --> 00:05:13,605
I want it!

105
00:05:13,647 --> 00:05:15,107
I don't think you can actually-

106
00:05:15,107 --> 00:05:17,317
I WANT IT! WANT IT!!!

107
00:05:17,734 --> 00:05:19,611
All right, all right,
come on- come on, young man.

108
00:05:19,736 --> 00:05:20,737
Wa-I'm, Wa-I'm sorry, ma'am.

109
00:05:20,779 --> 00:05:22,000
I'd like to be your boyfriend and all,

110
00:05:22,281 --> 00:05:24,074
even though you
have kind of a big nose,

111
00:05:24,116 --> 00:05:27,619
but my parents told me,
"never get into a car with a stranger."

112
00:05:27,828 --> 00:05:30,080
Well did they say anything about limosines?

113
00:05:30,581 --> 00:05:33,041
Butters, never get into a car with a stranger!

114
00:05:33,125 --> 00:05:34,835
Unless it's a limosine.

115
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:38,213
Oh.Yeah, actually,
they did say that'd be all right.

116
00:05:38,255 --> 00:05:42,426
Get in the limo, Mr. Biggles!
We're gonna have a bear costume made for you!

117
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,762
And now, back to The Price is Right!

118
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:48,932
Hi, sweetie.

119
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:50,767
What's the matter.

120
00:05:51,393 --> 00:05:55,898
Mom, Dad...I'm growing concerned about the role
models young women have in today's society.

121
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,235
It seems that lewdness
and shallowness are being exalted,

122
00:06:00,277 --> 00:06:02,321
while intellectualism is looked down upon.

123
00:06:03,488 --> 00:06:04,198
..Gosh.

124
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,535
I think young women are being marketed
to by corrupt, moral-less corporations.

125
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,039
Well, we'll get right on fixing that, sweetie.

126
00:06:12,414 --> 00:06:13,727
Wanna watch The Price is Right?

127
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,506
Dad, there's a new store at
the mall called "Stupid Spoiled Whore"

128
00:06:20,547 --> 00:06:22,257
and I'm gonna go there and buy a thong!

129
00:06:22,883 --> 00:06:25,260
What?! No daughter of mine
is going to dress like a whore!

130
00:06:25,302 --> 00:06:27,804
We're marching down to
that store right now, young lady!

131
00:06:30,891 --> 00:06:33,268
Oh my God! Well this place is-!

132
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:34,436
Oh my God!

133
00:06:35,521 --> 00:06:38,106
Mrs. Polk, you're buying this
stuff for your daughter?!

134
00:06:38,524 --> 00:06:42,361
It's what's in right now. I, I can't have my
little girl be the only one not in a trend;

135
00:06:42,402 --> 00:06:43,487
she'll be unpopular.

136
00:06:43,737 --> 00:06:46,000
Unpopular?! If she's not a whore?!

137
00:06:46,573 --> 00:06:47,783
But these are our girls!

138
00:06:48,158 --> 00:06:50,000
I think it's empowering for them.

139
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:52,913
I mean, sure, if a man wants
to be a whore, it's "normal,"

140
00:06:52,955 --> 00:06:55,415
but if a woman wants to be one,
it's "wrong. "

141
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,587
But, when a man pees standing up,
it's "normal,"

142
00:07:00,629 --> 00:07:03,340
but when a woman does it,
it's "weeeird."

143
00:07:03,549 --> 00:07:08,136
- Yeah! Right!
- Yeah, like, when men shave their balls it's fine,

144
00:07:08,178 --> 00:07:11,598
but when a woman does
it she's "straaange."

145
00:07:11,765 --> 00:07:13,559
- Yeah! Right!
- It isn't fair!

146
00:07:14,184 --> 00:07:18,272
All the girls in South Park are gonna be total sluts
from now on, so you can just get used to it.

147
00:07:18,564 --> 00:07:23,000
Yeah. Will you buy me that purse I want over there?
I'll do anything, 'cause I'm a whore.

148
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,862
Oh, uh uh sure I, I can buy a purse.

149
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:25,654
Dad!!

150
00:07:25,863 --> 00:07:27,364
Nope. Wendy, I think they're right.

151
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,450
You see, you have to believe
in the rights of women.

152
00:07:30,701 --> 00:07:32,703
For too long they've had to live a double standard.

153
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:33,787
Oh yeah.

154
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
I'm sorry I've been so chauvinistic, Wendy.

155
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
From now on you can have whatever
you want from this store,

156
00:07:38,167 --> 00:07:41,211
I'll help make you the stupidest,
most spoiled whore of them all!

157
00:07:41,212 --> 00:07:42,212
Yeahah! Hooray!

158
00:07:45,132 --> 00:07:48,719
Butters, will you mind telling us
why you're dressed up like a bear?!

159
00:07:50,262 --> 00:07:51,096
Oh, well,

160
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:54,349
uh, my sort-of-girlfriend dressed me up like this.

161
00:07:54,433 --> 00:07:55,475
Your girlfriend?

162
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
There you are, Mr. Biggles!
Aw I thought I'd lost you!

163
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,647
Promise you'll never leave me.

164
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,401
Butters? You're dating Paris Hilton?

165
00:08:04,776 --> 00:08:06,320
You are grounded, mister!

166
00:08:06,528 --> 00:08:08,197
I'm sorry.

167
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Uh, sweetheart, isn't Paris Hilton
worth a lot of money?

168
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Chris, she's more than twice Butters' age!

169
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,538
Yes, and more than
three billion times his net worth.

170
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:19,249
Everybody adores that girl, darling.
We should be nice to her too,

171
00:08:19,249 --> 00:08:20,918
especially if she's in love with our son!

172
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,505
Uhm, Paris, would you like
to have some cocoa with us?

173
00:08:27,591 --> 00:08:29,051
With schnapps and Scotch.

174
00:08:32,513 --> 00:08:35,766
So, Paris, I understand you're
from the prestigious Hilton family.

175
00:08:35,807 --> 00:08:36,642
Very nice hotels.

176
00:08:37,601 --> 00:08:39,686
I've gotta get outta here.
This place is stupid.

177
00:08:39,728 --> 00:08:40,562
Where am I?

178
00:08:40,896 --> 00:08:43,000
Oh, I wanna take Mr. Biggles with me.

179
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,274
With you where?

180
00:08:44,816 --> 00:08:47,000
To live with me forever and ever,
you dumb broad.

181
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:47,611
How much?

182
00:08:48,362 --> 00:08:50,030
How much? For Butters?

183
00:08:50,322 --> 00:08:53,450
Butters is our son. He's not for sale.

184
00:08:53,492 --> 00:08:55,536
I'll give you 200 million dollars for it.

185
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:57,913
Escuse me?!

186
00:08:58,747 --> 00:09:01,583
I said I'll give you 200
million dollars for it!

187
00:09:06,255 --> 00:09:08,674
I'll write you a check for
Mr. Biggles right now.

188
00:09:08,799 --> 00:09:09,883
Chris, is she serious?

189
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,803
Aj, Butters, why don't you take Paris
up to your room for a little while,

190
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,304
Mommy and Daddy have to talk.

191
00:09:14,471 --> 00:09:17,891
Mom, Dad, I I love you.
Please don't sell me to Paris Hilton.

192
00:09:17,891 --> 00:09:19,017
Butters, right now!!

193
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,688
We aren't honestly considering this?

194
00:09:22,729 --> 00:09:26,000
Darling, Paris is a billionaire. She can
give Butters everything he wants.

195
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,901
We'd be terrible parents NOT to consider it.

196
00:09:28,068 --> 00:09:29,027
But he's our son!

197
00:09:29,236 --> 00:09:30,696
I know, darling, but look...

198
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,407
we have to think about the rest of the family.

199
00:09:33,657 --> 00:09:35,367
The rest of the f- you do mean us?

200
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:37,244
Yes, us, the rest of the family.

201
00:09:37,911 --> 00:09:41,290
What should we do, Mr. Biggles?
I drank too much.

202
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,877
Oh my God, I'm so wasted!

203
00:09:45,294 --> 00:09:47,254
The room's all spinny.

204
00:09:47,838 --> 00:09:50,299
I'm... totally passing out.

205
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:04,855
Hey Bebe!

206
00:10:04,855 --> 00:10:06,231
I heard you were having a party tonight.

207
00:10:06,773 --> 00:10:08,192
You wouldn't be interested, Wendy.

208
00:10:08,233 --> 00:10:10,694
My parents are out of town,
so it's a Stupid Spoiled Whore party.

209
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,487
I'm a stupid spoiled whore.

210
00:10:13,822 --> 00:10:16,533
Right. Please, Wendy, you're
like Class President and stuff!

211
00:10:16,575 --> 00:10:18,869
Yeah, and you get straight A's in school!

212
00:10:18,911 --> 00:10:21,455
You're not even spoiled, because
your parents give money to charity!

213
00:10:21,497 --> 00:10:23,332
You don't want to go to this party, Wendy!

214
00:10:23,373 --> 00:10:25,417
We're inviting all the boys,
and we're gonna play Spin the Bottle,

215
00:10:25,459 --> 00:10:27,294
and Two Minutes In The Closet, and do ketamine.

216
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:28,629
That's okay.

217
00:10:28,712 --> 00:10:30,839
Oh, please, do you even know what ketsmine is?

218
00:10:30,881 --> 00:10:31,632
Yes.

219
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,550
See? You are too smart.

220
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,802
Yeah. We have no idea what ketamine is.

221
00:10:35,844 --> 00:10:38,263
Sorry Wendy.
You're just not a whore. Get lost!

222
00:10:38,347 --> 00:10:39,181
Yeah.

223
00:10:41,683 --> 00:10:43,977
Hey, we'd better start
invitng boys to the party.

224
00:10:44,394 --> 00:10:46,000
Oooo look, here comes Clyde.

225
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,648
Party at my house tonight, Clyde.

226
00:10:47,689 --> 00:10:48,565
You're invited.

227
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,651
Mmm, I'd like a piece of that!

228
00:10:50,692 --> 00:10:51,735
I wanna do him.

229
00:10:51,777 --> 00:10:53,000
Oh, yeah. Here comes Kyle.

230
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Mmm, talk to me, kosher boy.

231
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,115
I'd like to swivel his pixie stick.

232
00:10:57,407 --> 00:10:59,076
Party at my house tonight, Kyle.

233
00:10:59,785 --> 00:11:02,120
Tweek and Jason - that'd be a great three-way.

234
00:11:02,162 --> 00:11:03,664
Yeah, they're invited too.

235
00:11:03,705 --> 00:11:06,375
Jason has a huge bulge.
You're gonna get it, boys.

236
00:11:06,583 --> 00:11:08,000
Now here's what I'm talking about.

237
00:11:08,085 --> 00:11:09,837
A little midngith blue!

238
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,339
Yeah, I'd like to wax his crankshaft!

239
00:11:12,756 --> 00:11:14,550
Be at Bebe's house, tonight, at seven!

240
00:11:22,558 --> 00:11:23,809
Look, here comes Kevin.

241
00:11:23,892 --> 00:11:25,477
Hey Kevin, party at my house.

242
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,771
I'd like to gargle his marbles.

243
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:28,605
Yeah,

244
00:11:28,647 --> 00:11:29,523
you said it.

245
00:11:29,857 --> 00:11:30,691
See you there, Kev.

246
00:11:34,778 --> 00:11:37,948
"Dude, there's Cartman.
We should invite him to the party for sure."

247
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:41,869
Fuck you Millie,

248
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:42,661
fuck you Annie,

249
00:11:42,703 --> 00:11:43,537
fuck you Bebe,

250
00:11:43,579 --> 00:11:45,247
fuck you whatever your name is,

251
00:11:45,289 --> 00:11:46,748
and fuck you, bitch!

252
00:11:50,252 --> 00:11:53,714
Huh. Didn't I... Whoa, that's
the darnedest thing I ever saw.

253
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,550
Ms. Hilton? Uh, Ms. Hilton.

254
00:11:57,885 --> 00:11:58,844
Where am I?

255
00:11:59,511 --> 00:12:02,222
This room's all middle-class and small!

256
00:12:02,514 --> 00:12:04,474
Ms. Hilton, we've talked it over all night and ...

257
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,560
while your offer is enticing,

258
00:12:06,602 --> 00:12:09,897
I'm afraid we just can't sell you our son
for 200 million dollars.

259
00:12:11,481 --> 00:12:14,484
It'll have to be 250 million, cash, up front.

260
00:12:14,818 --> 00:12:16,000
Oh hamburgers!

261
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,323
Yay Mr. Biggles, you're mine forever!

262
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,658
Please! Ah I don't want to live with her!

263
00:12:21,742 --> 00:12:24,000
She snores real bad, and she has a huge nose,

264
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,454
and a squishy thing that lives in her pants!

265
00:12:25,746 --> 00:12:27,539
Please! Please don't sell me to her!

266
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,667
All right, Butters, tell you what:

267
00:12:30,792 --> 00:12:34,546
if you can raise the 250 million
dollars yourself, you can stay.

268
00:12:34,922 --> 00:12:37,424
Uh, well huh, how am I supposed
to make that kind of money??

269
00:12:37,466 --> 00:12:39,092
It's called "working" young man!

270
00:12:39,176 --> 00:12:42,000
Your grandfather was a coal miner
for fifty years; he never complained!

271
00:12:42,221 --> 00:12:43,680
Get out there and start digging!

272
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:44,723
Y-yes sir!

273
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,808
I-I gotta... mine some coal...

274
00:12:46,850 --> 00:12:47,434
really fast!

275
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:52,523
That should keep him busy for a while
while we get this transaction finished.

276
00:12:52,648 --> 00:12:54,316
Now, Ms. Hilton, how should we start?

277
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,743
Okay, that's two minutes.
You can come out, Clyde, Bab.

278
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
How was he, Bab?

279
00:13:08,372 --> 00:13:10,165
We had a great time, didn't we Clyde?

280
00:13:19,758 --> 00:13:22,469
Oh, hey, What's goin' on?
I'm uh, here for the party.

281
00:13:23,136 --> 00:13:24,346
Yeah? Who invited you?

282
00:13:24,763 --> 00:13:26,849
Oh uh uh Kelly. Kelly invited me.

283
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:27,766
Kelly who?

284
00:13:28,392 --> 00:13:30,727
Kelly Rutherford Menskin.

285
00:13:31,144 --> 00:13:32,688
Kelly Rutherford Menskin?!

286
00:13:33,313 --> 00:13:34,064
Yeah?

287
00:13:35,232 --> 00:13:36,692
- Did you invite him?
- No!

288
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,361
Oh wait wait wait, aah it wasn't her.

289
00:13:39,403 --> 00:13:39,987
That's right, I forgot,

290
00:13:40,028 --> 00:13:42,531
it was uh... Kelly Pinkerton Tinfurter.

291
00:13:43,115 --> 00:13:44,449
Kelly Pinkerton Tinfurter?

292
00:13:45,158 --> 00:13:45,951
What?

293
00:13:46,577 --> 00:13:47,619
Oh Goddamnit!

294
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,168
Oh, hello Wendy.

295
00:13:54,209 --> 00:13:55,294
Are you all right?

296
00:13:55,502 --> 00:13:56,670
No, I need help.

297
00:13:57,504 --> 00:13:58,422
From from me?

298
00:13:58,463 --> 00:14:00,090
Actually, I was hoping to see your boyfriend.

299
00:14:00,424 --> 00:14:03,135
Well sure, come on in.
Mr. Slave is right over here.

300
00:14:05,554 --> 00:14:09,975
Oh Jezuth, Jezuth Christh!

301
00:14:10,267 --> 00:14:11,143
Mr. Slave,

302
00:14:11,643 --> 00:14:13,562
little Wendy from class wants to see you.

303
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,147
Oh, hi Wendy.

304
00:14:15,397 --> 00:14:17,357
You need a little help
with your math homework?

305
00:14:17,733 --> 00:14:20,277
No, I need help becoming
a dirty whore like you.

306
00:14:21,778 --> 00:14:24,865
Oh dear. Mr. Slave, I think you
and Wendy better have a little talk.

307
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,283
I'll make some cocoa.

308
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,079
Mr. Slave, you're the most perverted,
lewd, depraved slut I know.

309
00:14:31,205 --> 00:14:32,206
Thank you sweetie.

310
00:14:32,247 --> 00:14:34,000
Can you teach me your secret fast?

311
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,753
Honey, I didn't work to become a whore,
I was born a whore.

312
00:14:37,836 --> 00:14:40,756
I've been one... ever since I can remember.

313
00:14:41,548 --> 00:14:44,051
Ever since I was a little
boy I seemed to enjoy...

314
00:14:44,343 --> 00:14:45,469
different things.

315
00:14:46,512 --> 00:14:48,514
Mommy, I think I have a fever.

316
00:14:48,555 --> 00:14:50,057
Can you take my temperature?

317
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,144
Jezuth Christh.

318
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,398
As I got older,
I felt that one boy was never enough.

319
00:14:58,649 --> 00:15:00,067
Hey, there's that queer kid.

320
00:15:00,150 --> 00:15:00,901
Let's tackle him!

321
00:15:01,485 --> 00:15:04,738
- Hey yeah, tackle the queer kid!
- We'll show you, queer!

322
00:15:06,573 --> 00:15:07,783
Jezuth Christh!

323
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,000
So you see, I can't make
you into a whore, Wendy.

324
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,123
But why would you want to be one anyway?

325
00:15:15,207 --> 00:15:16,750
Because all the other girls are.

326
00:15:16,792 --> 00:15:19,670
They're having a huge sex party
right now and I'm not invited.

327
00:15:19,711 --> 00:15:22,130
A what?? For God's sake, where??

328
00:15:25,175 --> 00:15:28,679
You work eighteen hours and what do you get?

329
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:31,557
Parents sell ya to Paris Hilton.

330
00:15:33,934 --> 00:15:34,685
Look at that.

331
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,521
A bear, mining for coal.

332
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,773
Well. I never.

333
00:15:42,693 --> 00:15:43,777
Well Butters, how'd it go?

334
00:15:43,819 --> 00:15:45,737
Did you dig up 200 million
dollar's worth of coal?

335
00:15:45,904 --> 00:15:47,698
Well, no, not quite.

336
00:15:47,823 --> 00:15:52,202
Well, too bad. Ms. Hilton did raise the money,
so you'll be going off with her.

337
00:15:52,619 --> 00:15:53,787
Well ah, shucks!

338
00:15:55,747 --> 00:15:57,207
Bye, sweetie, we love you!

339
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,835
Smile Mr. Biggles!

340
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:04,089
This time I have to get a picture
of my new pet BEFORE anything happens.

341
00:16:04,882 --> 00:16:06,258
Before what happens?

342
00:16:07,634 --> 00:16:08,927
MY PETS

343
00:16:24,234 --> 00:16:25,360
Mr. Biggles!

344
00:16:25,444 --> 00:16:27,070
Mr. Biggles, come back!

345
00:16:27,863 --> 00:16:29,448
You'd better help me find him!

346
00:16:29,531 --> 00:16:31,617
No Mr. Biggles, no money!

347
00:16:31,825 --> 00:16:33,535
Oh that troublemaking son of ours!

348
00:16:33,577 --> 00:16:36,622
Butters! Butters, you get back here
or you are grounded, mister!

349
00:16:47,758 --> 00:16:49,092
Oh Jezuth!

350
00:16:52,262 --> 00:16:53,805
Kids, kids!

351
00:16:54,348 --> 00:16:55,390
Ew, potty mouth!

352
00:16:55,474 --> 00:16:56,600
Shut off the light.

353
00:16:57,017 --> 00:16:57,809
Oh, thank God.

354
00:16:58,894 --> 00:17:01,000
Girls, what on earth are you doing?

355
00:17:01,230 --> 00:17:02,981
We're being stupid spoiled whores.

356
00:17:03,524 --> 00:17:04,983
H-help! You've gotta hide me!

357
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,486
Uh don't tell her I'm in here!

358
00:17:08,237 --> 00:17:11,865
What did you do, Wendy?! Go rat on us
because you're not invited to our Paris Hilton party?!

359
00:17:11,907 --> 00:17:14,284
Okay, I think this has all gone far enough!

360
00:17:14,368 --> 00:17:18,000
Now look, the last person you want
to be like is Paris Hilton!

361
00:17:18,330 --> 00:17:20,000
Mr. Biggles!

362
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,167
Paris Hilton is a nobody!

363
00:17:22,501 --> 00:17:26,338
She may have money, but she's a thoughtless,
talentless lowlife!

364
00:17:26,505 --> 00:17:28,757
Who the fuck are you calling a lowlife?!

365
00:17:29,132 --> 00:17:32,177
Wow, Paris Hilton is at my party!
I rule!

366
00:17:34,179 --> 00:17:38,350
Hon, will you just tell these girls
that being a whore isn't such a great thing.

367
00:17:38,392 --> 00:17:40,000
What isn't great about it?

368
00:17:40,102 --> 00:17:42,396
What's more to life than partying?

369
00:17:42,521 --> 00:17:47,901
Look girls, I've partied a lot. Okay?
And I'm telling you, there's more to life.

370
00:17:47,943 --> 00:17:50,863
You don't even know what partying is, loser.

371
00:17:51,071 --> 00:17:53,448
Sweetie, really, don't go there, okay?

372
00:17:53,532 --> 00:17:57,870
Oh I went there. I went there,
took some pictures, and flew back already.

373
00:17:59,000 --> 00:17:59,830
Wow, what a bitch.

374
00:18:00,414 --> 00:18:01,623
Sweetie, listen,

375
00:18:01,665 --> 00:18:04,668
I know you've done some partying
in your private little rich life,

376
00:18:04,710 --> 00:18:07,629
but you don't even wanna know
the kind of stuff I've done.

377
00:18:07,671 --> 00:18:10,924
I'm the real whore,
and I'm telling you, it isn't great.

378
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,428
Oh yeah?! I challenge you to a whore-off!

379
00:18:15,804 --> 00:18:17,764
- Whore-off!
- Whore-off!

380
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:24,271
Ahh testing? Hello?
Okay uh, welcome everyone.

381
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:29,026
The South Park Chamber of Commerce
is pleased to bring you the first annual

382
00:18:29,067 --> 00:18:31,403
"Who Is The Biggest Whore" showdown.

383
00:18:34,573 --> 00:18:36,825
Mr. Slave has no idea what he's in for.

384
00:18:36,909 --> 00:18:38,243
Paris is gonna rock his world.

385
00:18:38,785 --> 00:18:43,000
I'm... not quite sure how we...
start this competition off, but uh-

386
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,708
I'll show ya how we start it off.

387
00:18:53,467 --> 00:18:55,636
What is Mr. Slave doing?
He he's just sitting there.

388
00:18:55,886 --> 00:18:57,554
Give him time, Wendy. Give him time.

389
00:18:57,971 --> 00:18:59,348
Come on, Mr. Slave.

390
00:19:00,307 --> 00:19:01,000
Back off!

391
00:19:01,266 --> 00:19:03,519
None of you losers are enough for me!

392
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,617
Oh no she di'int.

393
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:54,528
Jezuth.

394
00:20:00,159 --> 00:20:01,451
Now, that's a whore!

395
00:20:04,204 --> 00:20:06,832
Wow, I guess Paris isn't such hot shit after all.

396
00:20:07,583 --> 00:20:10,586
People, don't applaud me.
I'm a dirty whore.

397
00:20:12,212 --> 00:20:17,259
Being spoiled and stupid and whorish
is supposed to be a bad thing, remember?

398
00:20:17,885 --> 00:20:22,181
Parents, if you don't teach your children that people
like Paris Hilton are supposed to be despised,

399
00:20:22,389 --> 00:20:24,000
where are they gonna learn it?

400
00:20:24,433 --> 00:20:25,309
You have to be the-

401
00:20:26,351 --> 00:20:27,311
Jezuth Christh.

402
00:20:27,477 --> 00:20:31,648
You have to be the ones to make sure
your daughters aren't looking up to the wrong people.

403
00:20:32,399 --> 00:20:36,987
The homosexual is right. From now on, Bebe,
you're going to dress like a little girl.

404
00:20:37,696 --> 00:20:39,114
Wendy, we're sorry we called you names.

405
00:20:39,156 --> 00:20:41,000
Like not-stupid and not-spoiled.

406
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,868
Yeah, and I didn't mean
to say you weren't a whore.

407
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,286
That's okay, you guys.

408
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:48,290
So- so that's it?
No 200 million dollars?

409
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,834
Well, Butters,
I hope you're happy!

410
00:20:51,168 --> 00:20:52,669
I'm a bad bear.

411
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:54,755
I'm a very bad old bear.

412
00:20:54,796 --> 00:20:56,256
You're grounded, old bear.

413
00:21:00,177 --> 00:21:02,387
Oh my God, it's so gross!

414
00:21:02,721 --> 00:21:04,389
Let me out of here!

415
00:21:08,435 --> 00:21:09,811
What the fuck is that?

416
00:21:11,063 --> 00:21:14,983
Paris, you must find the way out
of this place or you'll surely die.

417
00:21:15,651 --> 00:21:16,276
What?

418
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,487
Make your way to the small intestine.

419
00:21:18,654 --> 00:21:21,406
There you will meet the Sparrow Prince,
who can guide you to Catatafish.

420
00:21:21,448 --> 00:21:23,158
Now go, Paris Hilton. Make haste!

421
00:21:24,618 --> 00:21:29,540
A great adventure is waiting for you ahead.

422
00:21:29,832 --> 00:21:34,000
Hurry onward Paris Hilton
or you will soon be dead.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
