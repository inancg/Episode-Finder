1
00:00:38,301 --> 00:00:39,581
You guys know what?

2
00:00:39,665 --> 00:00:43,134
Um, the last thing you dowhen you die,
is crap your pants.

3
00:00:43,191 --> 00:00:43,699
...What?

4
00:00:44,179 --> 00:00:47,547
Yeah, when you die, your jowels release
and crap comes flying out your ass.

5
00:00:49,587 --> 00:00:50,893
That is fucking stupid, Cartman!

6
00:00:51,245 --> 00:00:53,840
Oh yeah?! I'll bet you five bucks that
when you die you crap your pants,

7
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:54,368
asshole!

8
00:00:54,658 --> 00:00:55,772
Hey everybody, it's time!

9
00:00:56,260 --> 00:00:56,756
It's time!

10
00:00:57,343 --> 00:00:59,982
It's time. Oh, it's time? It's happening.
It's happening now? Let's go!

11
00:01:00,338 --> 00:01:00,837
It's time for what?

12
00:01:01,330 --> 00:01:03,453
Get down to Metzger's Field! It's about to happen!

13
00:01:06,694 --> 00:01:11,243
People of South Park I am pleased to be
with you on this most historic day.

14
00:01:11,917 --> 00:01:14,050
A day you were certainly all remember...

15
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:19,916
as the day your town... became great. The
grand opening of the first South Park...

16
00:01:20,232 --> 00:01:21,228
WALL*MART!

17
00:01:26,566 --> 00:01:28,659
Look at it, honey. It's so big.

18
00:01:29,311 --> 00:01:31,016
It's like we're a real town now.

19
00:01:32,555 --> 00:01:33,722
Whoa, awesome!

20
00:01:34,179 --> 00:01:37,549
Hey! Isn't there where Stark's Pond used to be?
Where we used to kayak and fish?

21
00:01:38,092 --> 00:01:39,234
Yeah! Now it's a Wall*Mart!

22
00:01:40,492 --> 00:01:43,687
I know that with the opening of 
the South Park branch of Wall*Mart,

23
00:01:43,729 --> 00:01:48,656
you will all see your town completely change...

24
00:01:49,982 --> 00:01:52,593
Now, shop friends. Shop!

25
00:02:00,258 --> 00:02:01,465
It's beautiful!

26
00:02:03,024 --> 00:02:07,211
Welcome to Wall*Mart.
 Welcome to Wall*Mart.

27
00:02:07,252 --> 00:02:09,738
...Welcome to Wall*Mart.

28
00:02:09,738 --> 00:02:11,134
Sharon, isn't that your father?

29
00:02:11,389 --> 00:02:15,906
Yes. Wall*Mart is the leading employer of seniors.
And they also employ the handicapped.

30
00:02:16,581 --> 00:02:20,609
Hello, Mrs. M-marsh. Can I help g... Can I
help you get a sh- shopping cart today?

31
00:02:21,183 --> 00:02:22,367
Why yes I'd love one, Jimmy.

32
00:02:32,406 --> 00:02:35,649
My God. Look at all these incedible bargains.

33
00:02:36,361 --> 00:02:40,396
Dude, check it out! Time Cop on DVD. 
Three copies for eighteen bucks!

34
00:02:41,202 --> 00:02:43,027
Why the hell would you want three copies of the same movie?

35
00:02:43,357 --> 00:02:46,519
Because one copy is nine ninety-eight! But
this way you save like twenty bucks!

36
00:02:46,987 --> 00:02:48,662
You only need one copy, artard!

37
00:02:48,944 --> 00:02:51,803
Okay, fine, dumbass, YOU go ahead and
buy one copy for nine ninety-eight!

38
00:02:52,163 --> 00:02:53,126
Okay, fine, I will!

39
00:02:54,746 --> 00:02:56,354
Huh, wait a minute! 
I don't even want ONE copy of Time Cop!

40
00:02:57,592 --> 00:03:00,297
Dude, you can't shop for crap.

41
00:03:01,616 --> 00:03:02,643
I can't believe these bargains.

42
00:03:05,088 --> 00:03:07,480
Fools. Ignorant fools.

43
00:03:12,589 --> 00:03:14,486
Just look at the Marsh family, huh?

44
00:03:14,570 --> 00:03:17,372
Brand-new television,
new plastic dishware and cups,

45
00:03:17,372 --> 00:03:19,848
and enough bulk-buy ramen to last us a thousand winters.

46
00:03:21,683 --> 00:03:23,527
Dad, how come Wall*Mart 
is able to sell everything so cheap?

47
00:03:24,071 --> 00:03:28,783
It's simple economics, son. I don't understand it at all,
but, God I love it.

48
00:03:35,510 --> 00:03:36,764
six nienty-nine, fifteen dollars, etc.

49
00:03:40,417 --> 00:03:41,035
AAAH!

50
00:03:56,431 --> 00:03:57,366
Yeaaah...

51
00:03:58,780 --> 00:03:59,823
Randy, what are you doing?

52
00:04:00,454 --> 00:04:00,905
Anu-nothing!

53
00:04:02,098 --> 00:04:04,160
I'ma I'ma, I'm just gonna head down to 
the Wall*Mart real quick.

54
00:04:04,749 --> 00:04:05,859
It's almost midnight.

55
00:04:06,294 --> 00:04:08,952
Yeah, think about it. If I go there now,
there won't be anybody else there.

56
00:04:09,507 --> 00:04:10,666
I can all the bargains to myself!

57
00:04:15,548 --> 00:04:17,094
Thanks for coming to Wall*Mart.

58
00:04:17,474 --> 00:04:20,887
All are welcome. All are welcome!

59
00:04:25,455 --> 00:04:31,338
Excuse me! Hello! Can somebody tell my why we're going to Jim's Drugs
to buy Voltar cards when Wall*Mart has them for three bucks cheaper?

60
00:04:31,881 --> 00:04:34,551
Dude, I can't deal with Wall*Mart right now. 
My parents had me there for three hours last night.

61
00:04:36,881 --> 00:04:39,667
Oh, sorry boys. I'm going out of business.

62
00:04:40,131 --> 00:04:40,841
Why, Mr. Farkle?

63
00:04:41,302 --> 00:04:44,875
I can't compete with Wall*Mart's low prices.
Everyone is shopping there now,

64
00:04:45,202 --> 00:04:46,736
and... well, I can make ends meet.

65
00:04:49,514 --> 00:04:52,530
I've got to sell the store and try to find another line of work.

66
00:04:54,865 --> 00:04:55,765
Cartman, stop it!

67
00:04:56,234 --> 00:04:57,978
What? I just felt like playing a little violin, Kyle.

68
00:04:58,632 --> 00:05:02,098
I appreciate your business, boys, but you'll
have to try somewhere else in town.

69
00:05:05,104 --> 00:05:06,897
See? That sucks, dude!

70
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:08,750
That's called progress, Kyle.

71
00:05:09,337 --> 00:05:11,705
Yeah, but what about all the people getting
laid off from the grocery stores?

72
00:05:12,115 --> 00:05:12,918
And what about all the-

73
00:05:18,990 --> 00:05:21,682
... Whatever. I can go get another one at Wall*Mart.
It was only five bucks.

74
00:05:24,448 --> 00:05:26,171
Come on, let's go to Main Street 
and support one of those stores.

75
00:05:29,158 --> 00:05:29,587
What the hell?

76
00:05:45,092 --> 00:05:45,555
Butters?

77
00:05:48,212 --> 00:05:49,628
Butters? Uh what the hell are you doing?

78
00:05:50,523 --> 00:05:53,352
Wull ah I'm just playin' Monster. 
It's kinda spooky out here.

79
00:05:58,775 --> 00:06:00,832
Dude, we gotta show our parents 
what Wall*Mart is doing to our town.

80
00:06:04,887 --> 00:06:05,266
Dad?

81
00:06:06,705 --> 00:06:07,906
Jesus Christ, Dad. Dad??

82
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:09,371
So-o-o-o-on?

83
00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:11,847
Dad, oh my God!

84
00:06:12,725 --> 00:06:13,306
Son...

85
00:06:13,634 --> 00:06:14,791
What? D-dad, are are you dying?

86
00:06:15,305 --> 00:06:19,812
No, I'm just... really really tired. I...
was shopping at Wall*Mart all night.

87
00:06:20,313 --> 00:06:20,838
But you-your face!

88
00:06:21,352 --> 00:06:25,498
Checkout line... They had these... little
stickers filled with glitter!

89
00:06:25,914 --> 00:06:28,496
They were only ninety nine cents for 15 of them.

90
00:06:28,671 --> 00:06:30,476
I couldn't resist! Do you want one?

91
00:06:31,690 --> 00:06:33,797
Here. It's a little turtle.

92
00:06:43,996 --> 00:06:44,571
Come in?

93
00:06:47,262 --> 00:06:48,595
Oh hello, fine shoppers.

94
00:06:49,242 --> 00:06:54,643
Sir, we just had a big town meeting, and decided
we don't want your Wall*Mart here anymore.

95
00:06:56,937 --> 00:07:01,093
We're sorry, but it seems our Main Street is
dying and good people are losing their jobs.

96
00:07:01,762 --> 00:07:03,894
We'd all like you... out of South Park.

97
00:07:08,785 --> 00:07:09,698
Well

98
00:07:09,763 --> 00:07:14,982
What? What, you think I want to be here? I hate this place.
But it... won't let me leave.

99
00:07:16,008 --> 00:07:17,049
But you run the Wall*Mart.

100
00:07:18,034 --> 00:07:18,651
Oh you're wrong!

101
00:07:18,991 --> 00:07:23,166
Wall*Mart... isn't run by anybody! First
it reels you in with its bargains.

102
00:07:23,753 --> 00:07:24,570
Next thing you know you,

103
00:07:24,687 --> 00:07:26,788
you're workingbe at the Wall*Mart 
because it has all the jobs.

104
00:07:27,290 --> 00:07:29,355
Then you're sitting in a little office,
 trapped on all sides.

105
00:07:29,710 --> 00:07:30,863
They why don't you just quit?!

106
00:07:31,173 --> 00:07:33,164
Not so loud! It can hear you.

107
00:07:34,504 --> 00:07:35,835
You hate Wall*Mart too?

108
00:07:37,125 --> 00:07:37,494
ACK!

109
00:07:37,672 --> 00:07:41,828
I didn't say that! I love Wall*Mart! With all its...
fantastic bargains and one-stop shopping,

110
00:07:41,986 --> 00:07:42,649
who can't love it, right?

111
00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:48,298
Uh, Wa-Wall*Mart takes the hassle out of shopping and,
and makes it both affordable and fun.

112
00:07:50,987 --> 00:07:55,498
Ah- and Wall*Mart really gives back to the community! 
Us peopleare certainly happy to have a store like Wall*Mart,

113
00:07:55,559 --> 00:07:56,404
aren't we?

114
00:08:12,662 --> 00:08:14,800
Hey, wait a minute, I think we just got squirreled.

115
00:08:15,363 --> 00:08:18,398
Yeah. That guy probably thinks he can
get us to go away by being so goofy!

116
00:08:27,019 --> 00:08:28,754
Ha! You owe me five bucks, Kyle!

117
00:08:32,975 --> 00:08:34,097
Here we go, everyone.

118
00:08:34,181 --> 00:08:37,896
I got three nice steaks from South Park Grocery.
We'll have to share them.

119
00:08:37,896 --> 00:08:41,850
Eh, I remember when we could afford to buy
six steaks when we shopped at Wall*Mart.

120
00:08:42,109 --> 00:08:44,349
Yeah, but Dad, the whole town agreed not 
to shop at Wall*Mart anymore.

121
00:08:44,551 --> 00:08:46,356
I know, I KNOW! GOD!!

122
00:08:46,957 --> 00:08:47,599
BLEHH!

123
00:08:50,623 --> 00:08:52,845
Mom, Dad, when people die, 
do they always crap their-

124
00:08:53,985 --> 00:08:55,938
Oh, you stupid turd!

125
00:08:56,233 --> 00:08:59,966
Oh Jesus, a broken glass! Well, I don't see any choice now!
We have to go to Wall*Mart!

126
00:09:00,291 --> 00:09:00,736
We do?

127
00:09:01,157 --> 00:09:03,168
Huh! Where else are we gonna get 
a new glass at this hour?!

128
00:09:03,169 --> 00:09:04,920
Everyone get your shoes on,
 we're goin' to Wall*Mart!

129
00:09:04,976 --> 00:09:06,002
But Dad, we're not supposed to shop at-

130
00:09:06,189 --> 00:09:09,427
Stan! One family buying one glass
 isn't gonna make a difference!

131
00:09:17,488 --> 00:09:17,983
Hey...

132
00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:22,630
Gerald, what are you doing?! We said we weren't
going to shop at the Wall*Mart anymore!

133
00:09:23,376 --> 00:09:26,155
Well where else was I gonna get a napkin
dispenser at nine thirty at night?

134
00:09:26,915 --> 00:09:28,573
Mr. Garrison! Chef! Jimbo!

135
00:09:28,851 --> 00:09:33,066
Now, come on people! What the hell is wrong with you?!
 Don't you see what you're all doing?!

136
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:35,351
Well what are you doing here, Randy?

137
00:09:36,688 --> 00:09:39,454
I came because I wanted to make sure nobody was shopping here.

138
00:09:40,019 --> 00:09:40,416
Dad!

139
00:09:41,055 --> 00:09:49,205
Oh all right, em maybe I was gonna buy a glass. One glass!
... And some chips... And butter.

140
00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:51,109
And some new pliers.

141
00:09:52,069 --> 00:09:56,554
Jesus! Look at us! We all don't like the Wall*Mart,
but we can't stop coming here.

142
00:09:57,158 --> 00:09:59,610
It's like some mystical evil force.

143
00:09:59,781 --> 00:10:04,004
Yeah. This place has a power over us we can't resist!
We have to find a

144
00:10:04,150 --> 00:10:06,848
way to put the South Park Wall*Mart
 out of business once and for all!

145
00:10:07,452 --> 00:10:08,532
Let's burn it down!

146
00:10:09,445 --> 00:10:12,027
No no no! Let's freeze it!

147
00:10:12,599 --> 00:10:14,882
I think it's best we try to reason with it.

148
00:10:15,408 --> 00:10:19,177
No! All we have to do is not shop at Wall*Mart anymore!
If you want it to go away,

149
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:22,062
all it takes is a little self-control and personal responsibility.

150
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:35,013
Kumbaya, my Lord, Kumbaya.

151
00:10:35,454 --> 00:10:42,353
Kumbaya, my Lord, Kumbaya. 
Kumbaya, my Lord...

152
00:10:43,607 --> 00:10:46,310
You butthole, Kyle. 
You just had to go and ruin everything, didn't you?

153
00:10:46,715 --> 00:10:48,151
It wasn't my idea to burn the Wall*Mart down.

154
00:10:48,449 --> 00:10:51,261
No, but YOU got everyone all worked up!
You're jealous of the Wall*Mart.

155
00:10:51,489 --> 00:10:52,377
You always hated it.

156
00:10:52,566 --> 00:10:54,347
Dude, our town is going to be better without the-

157
00:10:55,024 --> 00:10:55,532
What the?

158
00:10:59,787 --> 00:11:00,355
Oh, awesome!

159
00:11:01,144 --> 00:11:02,977
How... How did this happen?

160
00:11:08,958 --> 00:11:10,969
Mom, Dad? Why are you shopping here?

161
00:11:11,604 --> 00:11:14,875
We can't destroy it, son.
 We have to learn to live with it.

162
00:11:17,216 --> 00:11:17,943
Can I help you?

163
00:11:21,888 --> 00:11:22,729
Dad, what are you doing?!

164
00:11:23,193 --> 00:11:27,354
You get a discount working here. Ten percent.
That means the bargains are even better.

165
00:11:27,662 --> 00:11:28,582
Dad, you're a geologist!

166
00:11:28,915 --> 00:11:31,772
I'll make less money, sure, but... as long
as I buy everything at Wall-Mart,

167
00:11:32,139 --> 00:11:32,961
it'll all even out.

168
00:11:33,429 --> 00:11:37,131
Don't you see? Wall*Mart isn't our enemy,
it's our neighborhood friend.

169
00:11:43,596 --> 00:11:44,806
Hey! Hey!

170
00:11:45,278 --> 00:11:46,906
Who the hell told you to put this thing back up?!

171
00:11:47,332 --> 00:11:49,541
Sorry kid, we've got orders from corporate headquarters.

172
00:11:50,039 --> 00:11:51,296
But nobody wants a Wall*Mart here!

173
00:11:51,793 --> 00:11:53,238
You're gonna have to talk to the higher-ups.

174
00:11:53,867 --> 00:11:54,488
Where are they?

175
00:11:54,766 --> 00:12:00,170
Bentonville, Arkansas. That's where Wall*Mart started,
that's where all the bigwigs are.

176
00:12:02,724 --> 00:12:05,184
Looks like we're gonna have to go to Arkansas.
 Come on, guys.

177
00:12:05,225 --> 00:12:08,275
We're gonna put a stop to 
Wall*Mart once and for all!

178
00:12:09,047 --> 00:12:10,936
Whoa, Pixie Sticks, twenty-nine cents?

179
00:12:16,253 --> 00:12:22,184
Wall*Mart? ...Are you speaking to me? ...My friends?
...Trying to hurt you again?

180
00:12:23,085 --> 00:12:25,351
Yes, Wall*Mart. I understand.

181
00:12:29,798 --> 00:12:31,748
Three tickets to Bentonville, Arkansas, please.

182
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:36,680
Wait guys! Hold on!
 I wanna go with you and help out.

183
00:12:37,121 --> 00:12:40,950
No way! You wanna go with us so you can betray us at some
point and keep us from destroying the Wall*Mart.

184
00:12:43,367 --> 00:12:43,877
Nuh uh.

185
00:12:44,734 --> 00:12:47,476
Yeah huh! You wanna go
 with us so that later you go, "Haha,

186
00:12:47,518 --> 00:12:49,879
I was working for Wall*Mart
all along" or something.

187
00:12:49,888 --> 00:12:50,805
I AM NOT, Kyle!

188
00:12:51,332 --> 00:12:52,805
Dude, just let him come. 
The bus is about to leave.

189
00:12:53,705 --> 00:12:55,047
All right, fine. Come on, fatass!

190
00:13:00,007 --> 00:13:01,587
Haha. You fools have no idea that I wuold
never let you hurt the Wall*Mart.

191
00:13:02,125 --> 00:13:02,718
I heard that!

192
00:13:03,188 --> 00:13:03,756
You heard what?

193
00:13:03,989 --> 00:13:05,991
You said we have no idea 
that you're never let us hurt Wall*Mart!

194
00:13:06,270 --> 00:13:07,185
That's not what I said!

195
00:13:07,605 --> 00:13:08,302
Dude, come on!

196
00:13:08,571 --> 00:13:10,362
He is working for the Wall*Mart 
to stup us from succeeding!

197
00:13:10,657 --> 00:13:11,482
Dude, we have to go!

198
00:13:13,056 --> 00:13:13,681
God-damnit!

199
00:13:15,509 --> 00:13:16,637
Well hurry up if you're coming, Cartman!

200
00:13:17,425 --> 00:13:22,539
Hehe. You stupid fools have no idea that I'm actually working
for the Wall*Mart to stup you from succeeding!

201
00:13:22,761 --> 00:13:26,436
Welcome to Bentonville, 
Home of Wall*Mart

202
00:13:29,469 --> 00:13:30,399
Goddamn that took a long time.

203
00:13:30,930 --> 00:13:33,232
It would've been faster if Cartman hadn't slashed the tires!

204
00:13:33,471 --> 00:13:36,557
I did not! I wanna close Wall*Mart
 just as much as you guys do!

205
00:13:41,064 --> 00:13:41,889
Can I help you?

206
00:13:42,408 --> 00:13:45,169
Yeah. We've come to complain. 
We don't want a Wall*Mart in our town.

207
00:13:46,622 --> 00:13:51,863
Who does? Nobody likes what the Wall*Mart does,
but it keeps... right on doing it.

208
00:13:53,783 --> 00:13:54,871
We want to talk to who's in charge.

209
00:13:55,606 --> 00:14:00,645
In charge? I guess that would be Harvey Brown.
He's the current president of Wall*Mart.

210
00:14:00,906 --> 00:14:02,164
One of the original creators.

211
00:14:02,612 --> 00:14:03,141
Where's he?

212
00:14:07,064 --> 00:14:13,435
We... invented the Wall*Mart Super Center in 1987.
The idea was simple: build a store

213
00:14:13,587 --> 00:14:16,762
for one-stop shopping where bulk purchases
could keep prices incredibly low.

214
00:14:17,815 --> 00:14:21,595
We didn't know what we were doing. 
In just four years, it was out of control.

215
00:14:22,263 --> 00:14:23,069
So how do we stop it?

216
00:14:24,933 --> 00:14:26,313
You don't stop it.

217
00:14:27,223 --> 00:14:28,002
There has to be a way!

218
00:14:28,269 --> 00:14:32,369
There's nothing! Don't you understand?! Nothing
can stop the Wall*Mart in your town!

219
00:14:34,086 --> 00:14:37,066
...Unless...of course, 
you can find and destroy its heart.

220
00:14:37,635 --> 00:14:38,783
The heart of Wall*Mart?

221
00:14:39,149 --> 00:14:40,834
Sir, don't you think you're talking a little too much?

222
00:14:41,291 --> 00:14:45,469
Every Wall*Mart has a heart, 
somewhere near the television department.

223
00:14:45,511 --> 00:14:48,320
Destroy the heart 
and you could reverse the entire process!

224
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:49,417
You speak too much, sir!

225
00:14:50,054 --> 00:14:51,102
Why don't you guys just destroy the heart?

226
00:14:51,418 --> 00:14:56,757
Because the Wall*Mart stops you. Many have tried,
kid. Union leaders, nature activists,

227
00:14:56,957 --> 00:14:59,511
even the best fair-trade lawyers
 tried to stop the Wall*Mart and now?

228
00:15:00,366 --> 00:15:02,703
They are Wall*Mart shoppers all.

229
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:05,247
All right. Come on you guys, 
we have to get back home.

230
00:15:06,881 --> 00:15:11,404
It won't work, don't you understand?! It isn't gonna
stop until there's nothing but Wall*Mart left!

231
00:15:11,997 --> 00:15:15,324
Jesus, what did we do??
 WHAT DID WE DO??

232
00:15:16,614 --> 00:15:17,174
Boys!

233
00:15:18,614 --> 00:15:21,792
Tell the world... Im sorry!

234
00:15:21,912 --> 00:15:22,318
No, dude, don't!

235
00:15:31,089 --> 00:15:32,189
That's ten bucks you owe me, dickface!

236
00:15:41,889 --> 00:15:45,459
All right, this is it! If Wall*Mart has a heart,
we have to find it and destroy it!

237
00:15:45,846 --> 00:15:47,876
No matter what the Wall*Mart does to try to stop us,

238
00:15:48,297 --> 00:15:50,537
we have to be strong! Let's do it.

239
00:15:50,971 --> 00:15:56,901
I'm afraid not, Kyle! Wall*Mart is a great store! I
could not let you fools ruin its terrific bargains!

240
00:15:57,164 --> 00:16:00,254
You see, I was working for Wall*Mart all along!

241
00:16:01,739 --> 00:16:02,561
I knew you were!

242
00:16:03,103 --> 00:16:03,667
No you didn't.

243
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:06,385
Yes I did! I said from the beginning that you would do this!

244
00:16:06,770 --> 00:16:07,299
No you didn't.

245
00:16:07,657 --> 00:16:08,214
Yes I did!!

246
00:16:08,414 --> 00:16:08,709
No you didn't.

247
00:16:08,863 --> 00:16:09,160
Yes I did!!

248
00:16:09,321 --> 00:16:09,578
No you didn't.

249
00:16:09,791 --> 00:16:10,042
Yes I did!!

250
00:16:10,249 --> 00:16:10,433
No you didn't.

251
00:16:10,648 --> 00:16:10,856
Yes I did!!

252
00:16:14,477 --> 00:16:16,586
... You see, Kyle, it was me who slashed the bu-

253
00:16:16,876 --> 00:16:20,364
-slashed the bus tires in Arkansas! I said so!
I told you the minute that I-

254
00:16:20,906 --> 00:16:21,573
-and I told you that-

255
00:16:21,746 --> 00:16:23,763
I can't hear you! Lalalalalala!

256
00:16:25,878 --> 00:16:30,168
I'm sorry, boys. but if you want to hurt the Wall*Mart,
you'll have to go through me!

257
00:16:30,819 --> 00:16:32,745
We don't have time for this! 
Kenny, keep him away from us!

258
00:16:34,267 --> 00:16:35,989
Very well, Kenny! Let us battle!

259
00:16:37,632 --> 00:16:39,442
No, Kenny. Kenny! Knock it off.

260
00:16:41,610 --> 00:16:43,095
Welcome to Wall*Mart.

261
00:16:43,347 --> 00:16:44,044
Save it, Grandpa!

262
00:16:44,952 --> 00:16:46,295
We've gotta find the television department.

263
00:16:53,982 --> 00:16:56,329
Boys, these axes are only four ninety-nine.

264
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:58,270
Dad, we know how to destroy the Wall*Mart.

265
00:16:59,770 --> 00:17:00,613
Shhhhh! What are you talking about?

266
00:17:01,079 --> 00:17:03,779
One of the creators told us. You have to take
your keys over to the television department.

267
00:17:04,056 --> 00:17:06,046
Television department... 
All right, come on, let's go!

268
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:09,734
Oh my God!

269
00:17:10,092 --> 00:17:10,515
What?!

270
00:17:10,634 --> 00:17:13,653
Those two-dollar salt-and-pepper shakers!
They were three dollars five minutes ago!

271
00:17:14,189 --> 00:17:16,103
The Wall*Mart is lowering its prices trying to stop us!

272
00:17:16,992 --> 00:17:17,958
Come on, we've got to try to make it to the back!

273
00:17:22,958 --> 00:17:25,199
Gaaahh! Don't look!
 Don't look at its bargains!

274
00:17:31,905 --> 00:17:33,352
I think I see the television department in the back!

275
00:17:33,567 --> 00:17:35,300
Is that the right way, Dad? Dad??

276
00:17:36,408 --> 00:17:36,851
Dad!

277
00:17:37,486 --> 00:17:39,322
The screwdrivier set is only nine ninety-eight!

278
00:17:39,504 --> 00:17:40,188
Come on, Dad!

279
00:17:40,668 --> 00:17:43,048
I can't make it, boys! 
You're gonna have to go on without me!

280
00:17:43,290 --> 00:17:44,367
No, dad! We need your keys!

281
00:17:44,607 --> 00:17:47,901
This bargain is too great for me!
 I'm gonna have to buy these!

282
00:17:47,943 --> 00:17:49,403
Here! Take the keys and go on!

283
00:17:49,709 --> 00:17:52,573
The television department is near the back! 
Next to the cell phones!

284
00:17:52,739 --> 00:17:55,822
Go! Hurry! I'm gonna go buy these screwdrivers!

285
00:17:56,522 --> 00:17:57,583
There! The television department!

286
00:18:03,461 --> 00:18:07,264
Hello, boys. 
Congratulations on getting this far.

287
00:18:07,993 --> 00:18:08,440
Who are you?

288
00:18:09,493 --> 00:18:11,344
I am... Wall*Mart.

289
00:18:13,113 --> 00:18:13,513
You?

290
00:18:14,427 --> 00:18:18,532
I've taken this form in order to talk to you.
But I can take many forms.

291
00:18:18,930 --> 00:18:24,762
Does this suit you better?
 Or perhaps you prefer this form?

292
00:18:27,327 --> 00:18:29,136
I can take whichever form I like.

293
00:18:31,409 --> 00:18:33,260
We don't want your store in our town;
 we come to destroy you.

294
00:18:33,661 --> 00:18:34,267
Where's the heart?

295
00:18:34,758 --> 00:18:37,784
To find the heart of Wall*Mart, 
one must first ask oneself,

296
00:18:37,826 --> 00:18:40,236
"Who is it that asked the question?"

297
00:18:40,954 --> 00:18:42,213
Me. I'm asking the question.

298
00:18:42,663 --> 00:18:44,004
Ah, yes, but who are you?

299
00:18:44,496 --> 00:18:45,817
Stan Marsh. Now, where's the heart?

300
00:18:46,314 --> 00:18:48,305
Ah. You know the answer,
 but not the question!

301
00:18:48,975 --> 00:18:50,762
The question is, "Where is the heart?"

302
00:18:53,054 --> 00:19:00,035
Very well. You want to see the heart of Wall*Mart?
It lies beyond that plasma-screen television.

303
00:19:05,822 --> 00:19:06,306
It's a mirror.

304
00:19:06,922 --> 00:19:10,526
Yes, don't you see? 
That is the heart of Wall*Mart.

305
00:19:10,567 --> 00:19:14,613
You, the consumer.
 I take many forms: Wall*Mart,

306
00:19:14,638 --> 00:19:19,659
Kay*Mart, Target,
 but I am one single entity: Desire!

307
00:19:20,126 --> 00:19:21,891
Well, the guy in Arkansas said to destroy the heart.

308
00:19:25,612 --> 00:19:28,652
Gaaah! NO! NO, what have you done??

309
00:19:30,398 --> 00:19:32,176
Now you shall see my true form!

310
00:19:37,511 --> 00:19:39,727
Now you see me as I truly am!

311
00:19:42,405 --> 00:19:42,998
We'd better get out of here.

312
00:19:50,233 --> 00:19:51,909
Get out! It's gonna blow!

313
00:19:55,336 --> 00:19:56,587
Hey, come on! We've gotta get out!

314
00:19:57,604 --> 00:19:59,943
Too late for me, son!
 I have to buy this stuff!

315
00:20:01,245 --> 00:20:03,089
The Wall*Mart is exploding! 
Everybody out now!

316
00:20:28,981 --> 00:20:31,508
Boys, you did it! You killed the Wall*Mart!

317
00:20:33,412 --> 00:20:34,435
How did you do it, Kyle?

318
00:20:34,719 --> 00:20:37,037
All Wall*Marts start a self-destruction sequence
if you break a mirror in the back.

319
00:20:37,438 --> 00:20:40,251
We know how to destroy it now. 
Spread the word to all the towns!

320
00:20:44,540 --> 00:20:50,371
Wait. I think I understand the symbolism of the mirror.
The Wall*Mart... is us.

321
00:20:51,006 --> 00:20:51,457
Duh.

322
00:20:51,711 --> 00:20:55,447
You see boys, if we like our small-town charm
more than the big corporate bullies,

323
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:59,813
we all have to be willing to... pay a little bit more.
Do you understand?

324
00:21:00,861 --> 00:21:04,201
Yeah! Let's all go shop at 
Jim's Drugs down the street!

325
00:21:23,129 --> 00:21:26,556
...Oh Lord, Kumbaya.

326
00:21:27,258 --> 00:21:28,809
All right, let's not make that mistake again.

327
00:21:29,149 --> 00:21:30,555
Yeah, lets all shop over at Tru-Value!

328
00:21:31,209 --> 00:21:32,100
Let's go! Yeah!

329
00:21:32,209 --> 00:21:34,100
