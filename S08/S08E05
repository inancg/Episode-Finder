6
00:01:05,102 --> 00:01:05,783
What the heck?

7
00:01:05,971 --> 00:01:07,614
Whoa! What a huge package!

8
00:01:08,188 --> 00:01:12,414
" To Butters Stotch. "
Oh boy ! It's for me ! It's for me !!

9
00:01:12,769 --> 00:01:15,270
"Sent from: Japan. Konichi-wa."

10
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:17,762
Wow ! A package for me from Japan !!

11
00:01:18,843 --> 00:01:21,683
Wow, what can it be?
My birthday isn't until September 11th.

12
00:01:23,077 --> 00:01:27,032
Oh boy ! I've never gotten a package this big !
I've always wanted to have a huge package.

13
00:01:35,244 --> 00:01:38,117
Greetings. I am the AWESOM-O 4000.

14
00:01:40,382 --> 00:01:41,531
Whoa...

15
00:01:42,155 --> 00:01:46,025
I have been sent from Japan to serve
as your personal robot.

16
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:49,270
You... you're my robot?

17
00:01:49,422 --> 00:01:51,771
Yes. I will be your new best friend.

18
00:01:52,058 --> 00:01:53,089
Oh wow !

19
00:01:55,023 --> 00:01:58,099
Yep. That's right. He's a real live robot.
He can walk and talk and everything.

20
00:01:58,302 --> 00:01:59,773
You're like the fourth kid I told already.

21
00:02:01,623 --> 00:02:03,905
Well I gotta go Dougie.
My robot and I have stuff to do.

22
00:02:04,902 --> 00:02:06,356
Heheh, they're all so jealous !

23
00:02:06,912 --> 00:02:10,698
I'm so glad you came into my life, AWESOM-O.
You're the best friend a guy could have.

24
00:02:10,951 --> 00:02:16,190
Yes. You can trust AWESOM-O. In fact, you should
tell AWESOM-O all your most personal secrets.

25
00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:19,993
AWESOM-O will not make fun of you or tell
your secrets to other people and stuff.

26
00:02:20,534 --> 00:02:23,187
Hey yeah ! Well I can tell you anything, huh ?

27
00:02:23,622 --> 00:02:27,673
Well lessee... Well, for one, I have
what's called a heziated colon

28
00:02:27,837 --> 00:02:29,881
which means I sometime can't control
my sphincter.

29
00:02:30,225 --> 00:02:31,019
Could be.

30
00:02:31,729 --> 00:02:35,177
Well, nobody knows it, but sometimes I poop
my pants, so I have to wear a diaper to school.

31
00:02:37,161 --> 00:02:38,125
You okay, AWESOM-O ?

32
00:02:38,412 --> 00:02:40,880
Yes. AWESOM-O is fine.
Please go on.

33
00:02:41,091 --> 00:02:43,034
Well, I have to take medicine for it every day.

34
00:02:43,254 --> 00:02:45,806
It's a little suppository I have to ...put up my rectom.

35
00:02:47,022 --> 00:02:50,572
That, that's very interesting.
Tell AWESOM-O more secrets.

36
00:02:50,825 --> 00:02:51,805
Hm, okay. Let's see

37
00:02:52,244 --> 00:02:55,912
Oh, my parents don't know, but sometimes
I get picked on by this one kid at school.

38
00:02:56,081 --> 00:02:59,022
his name is Eric Cartman, and he always
tries to play jokes on me and stuff.

39
00:02:59,341 --> 00:03:00,321
Oh, really ?

40
00:03:00,474 --> 00:03:02,806
Yeah. One time he made me think
a meteor had hit the earth,

41
00:03:03,009 --> 00:03:05,460
and convinced me to stay down
in a bomb shelter for three days.

42
00:03:05,671 --> 00:03:07,547
Heh. Wow, that sucks.

43
00:03:07,851 --> 00:03:11,400
Yeah. And then this other time, he pretended
to be me on the phone to my dad

44
00:03:11,543 --> 00:03:14,248
and called him a pussy,
so my dad came home and beat me.

45
00:03:14,525 --> 00:03:17,280
Wow. Sounds like this Cartman kid is pretty smart.

46
00:03:17,449 --> 00:03:19,697
No, he's not smart ! He's just an asshole.

47
00:03:19,959 --> 00:03:22,494
And he's never gonna play on me ever again!

48
00:03:22,748 --> 00:03:24,252
Really ? You think so ?

49
00:03:24,622 --> 00:03:27,292
Well, guess what, Butters.
I have a surprise for you.

50
00:03:27,394 --> 00:03:28,966
Yeah, and he's never gonna get me again!

51
00:03:29,135 --> 00:03:32,278
Cause what Cartman doesn't know is that I know one of his secrets !

52
00:03:33,276 --> 00:03:33,630
What ?

53
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:36,047
When Cartman is playing all alone in his backyard,

54
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:39,157
he likes to dress up like Britney Spears
and pretend he's her !

55
00:03:39,393 --> 00:03:42,250
Hi sings and dances around with a
life-sized cutout of Justin Timberlake.

56
00:03:44,073 --> 00:03:44,716
You saw that ?

57
00:03:45,239 --> 00:03:47,132
Yeah! And I videotaped him doing it !

58
00:03:48,316 --> 00:03:50,445
- Nuh uh.
I've got the whole thing on tape !

59
00:03:50,621 --> 00:03:52,699
Even him making out with the Justin Timberlake cutout !

60
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:53,932
No way.

61
00:03:54,155 --> 00:03:58,171
Yeah ! And if Cartman ever messes with me again,
I'm gonna show that video to everybody !

62
00:03:58,372 --> 00:03:59,886
Then I'll lhave my revenge, boy howdy !

63
00:04:01,119 --> 00:04:03,573
...Um, where is this videotape, Butters ?

64
00:04:04,029 --> 00:04:06,129
Huh ? Oh, I dunno. It's around here somewhere.

65
00:04:06,312 --> 00:04:07,829
Hey ! So what do you wanna do now, AWESOM-O ?

66
00:04:08,178 --> 00:04:11,407
Uh, Butters, maybe you should give AWESOM-O the videotape ?

67
00:04:11,608 --> 00:04:12,113
How come ?

68
00:04:12,326 --> 00:04:15,776
Well, because... AWESOM-O can, like,
back it up for you

69
00:04:15,926 --> 00:04:18,409
, and make copies and stuff.
I am AWESOM-O.

70
00:04:18,613 --> 00:04:21,396
Oh, that's all right, AWESOM-O.
Come on! I have a lot of things to teach you.

71
00:04:23,422 --> 00:04:24,691
Oh, son of a bitch !

72
00:04:28,032 --> 00:04:30,826
Hey there have you heard about my robot friend ?

73
00:04:30,967 --> 00:04:33,856
He's metal and small and
doesn't judge me at all.

74
00:04:33,934 --> 00:04:39,124
He's a cyberwired bundle of joy.
My robot friend.

75
00:04:40,634 --> 00:04:43,511
I like to dip and daddle
with my robot friend.

76
00:04:43,770 --> 00:04:46,612
He's smart as can be and emotion-free.

77
00:04:46,753 --> 00:04:52,283
And he's computin' his way to my heart.
My robot friend.

78
00:04:52,478 --> 00:04:55,355
My robot friend.

79
00:04:55,496 --> 00:04:58,983
My robot friend.

80
00:04:59,101 --> 00:05:01,895
My robot friend.

81
00:05:03,036 --> 00:05:06,735
Ohhh, that's so cute. Did you see
Butters and his friend Eric playing Robot.

82
00:05:06,923 --> 00:05:08,802
Yes. Those boys are quite imaginative.

83
00:05:08,896 --> 00:05:11,291
Leave it to them to find a fun way
to do the dishes.

84
00:05:12,149 --> 00:05:13,194
That's great AWESOM-O!

85
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:14,897
You can carry all my laundry in one trip!

86
00:05:15,123 --> 00:05:18,081
Ah, Buttters, it's getting late.
You should be getting ready for bed soon

87
00:05:18,387 --> 00:05:20,429
Okay Mom. Well, come on,
AWESOM-O. Bedtime.

88
00:05:20,594 --> 00:05:22,683
Oh, is your little robot friend staying the night?

89
00:05:22,824 --> 00:05:25,102
Well of course he is.
He's my robot, ain't he?

90
00:05:25,274 --> 00:05:27,341
That's okay with your mom, Mr. Robot?

91
00:05:27,505 --> 00:05:29,055
AWESOM-O does not have a mom.

92
00:05:29,266 --> 00:05:30,792
Yup! Don't you know nothin' about robot?

93
00:05:31,050 --> 00:05:32,811
Come on, AWESOM-O!
You can put my laundry away!

94
00:05:34,014 --> 00:05:35,493
Aww, that's just adorable.

95
00:05:35,704 --> 00:05:38,287
It's good to see Butters finally have
a friend that wants to stay over.

96
00:05:39,766 --> 00:05:42,302
I like to brush my teeth in
the morning and at night.

97
00:05:42,537 --> 00:05:45,354
The teeth won't mind ..
Jesus Christ I can't go on like this.

98
00:05:45,805 --> 00:05:50,149
Butters, remember when you said you had a
video of Eric Cartman dressed like Britney Spears?

99
00:05:50,572 --> 00:05:51,652
Oh. Yeah.

100
00:05:52,028 --> 00:05:53,507
I would like to see what he looks like

101
00:05:53,624 --> 00:05:55,174
so I can beat him up for you.

102
00:05:55,503 --> 00:05:56,630
May I see the video?

103
00:05:56,775 --> 00:05:58,325
Awww, you don't need to do
that, AWESOM-O.

104
00:05:58,489 --> 00:06:00,696
Hey, I gotta put in my suppository.
Can you help me?

105
00:06:01,213 --> 00:06:01,730
What?

106
00:06:02,410 --> 00:06:05,205
Remember I said I put that medicinal
suppository in my anus?

107
00:06:05,369 --> 00:06:07,388
It'll be so much easier havin' you
do it from now on.

108
00:06:07,627 --> 00:06:11,383
Um. Actually, AWESOM-O was not
programmed for that function.

109
00:06:11,642 --> 00:06:13,450
Haw, it's real easy.
I'll show you.

110
00:06:13,591 --> 00:06:16,502
You just take this little thingy out of
the plastic... paper, and and I'll,

111
00:06:16,619 --> 00:06:19,578
I'll pull down my pants ...
and just slide it up in my anus there.

112
00:06:21,132 --> 00:06:21,766
...No way.

113
00:06:22,306 --> 00:06:24,584
AWESOM-O, I though you were programmed
to do whatever I tell you.

114
00:06:25,828 --> 00:06:26,345
Weak!

115
00:06:27,895 --> 00:06:30,384
Yeyeah, that, that's pretty good.
Get it up there good and deep.

116
00:06:30,806 --> 00:06:31,323
Lame!

117
00:06:32,074 --> 00:06:33,976
All right AWESOM-O, time
for us to get some sleep.

118
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:36,609
Hey, you want me to teach
you some bedtime songs?

119
00:06:37,032 --> 00:06:40,718
If you leave me now, you'll take
away the biggest part of me.

120
00:06:42,004 --> 00:06:45,620
AWESOM-O must rest!
His CPU system overloading.

121
00:06:45,811 --> 00:06:48,723
Oh, o-o-all right AWESOM-O.
Let's get us some shut-eye,

122
00:06:49,004 --> 00:06:50,496
or what, or whatever robots have.

123
00:07:06,826 --> 00:07:08,543
Where is it? Where is it??

124
00:07:09,031 --> 00:07:12,389
AWESOM-O??
AWESOM-O, what the Sam Heck are you doing?

125
00:07:13,141 --> 00:07:16,417
Um, ah AWESOM-O is reorganizing
your stuff for you.

126
00:07:16,897 --> 00:07:20,478
Aw Jeez Jeez Louise! My mom is gonna be
awful sore when she sees this mess!

127
00:07:20,772 --> 00:07:22,615
Now AWESOM-O, that is a bad robot!

128
00:07:22,975 --> 00:07:25,781
You can't do no chores for me unless
I tell you to do them! You got it?!

129
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:27,754
AWESOM-O understands.

130
00:07:28,047 --> 00:07:31,159
Now I'm gonna have to give ya a spankin',
AWESOM-O, so that you'll learn better!

131
00:07:33,674 --> 00:07:36,445
Just know, AWESOM-O,
that I did it because I love you.

132
00:07:36,675 --> 00:07:38,275
Okay, come on, let's go
make some breakfast.

133
00:07:39,741 --> 00:07:41,591
Goddamnit, I have to find that videotape!

134
00:07:45,032 --> 00:07:48,915
Look at that, AWESOM-O!
I drew a picture of us playing in a field together.

135
00:07:50,021 --> 00:07:52,437
Ah I'll be right back.
I'm gonna get some Sunny Delight.

136
00:07:52,804 --> 00:07:54,571
I would like some Sunny Delight too.

137
00:07:54,945 --> 00:07:59,261
Don't be silly, AWESOM-O.
Robots don't need to drink nothin'.

138
00:07:59,661 --> 00:08:02,561
Whoa. Uh go answer the door, AWESOM-O.

139
00:08:02,893 --> 00:08:04,443
AWESOM-O will answers the door.

140
00:08:07,893 --> 00:08:09,093
What the hell are you doing, fatass?

141
00:08:09,257 --> 00:08:10,624
Dude, are you still pretending to be a robot?

142
00:08:11,657 --> 00:08:14,607
I just need to uh make Butters think
I'm a robot for a little while longer.

143
00:08:15,457 --> 00:08:15,841
Why?

144
00:08:16,673 --> 00:08:20,706
Because I need to, all right?! I've got something
planned that's uh gonna be really sweet.

145
00:08:20,898 --> 00:08:21,790
Just play along, okay?

146
00:08:22,717 --> 00:08:23,046
Why?

147
00:08:23,622 --> 00:08:26,263
Kyle, Goddamnit, will you just do-?
Who's at the door, AWESOM-O?

148
00:08:29,306 --> 00:08:31,349
Three boys named Stan, Kyle, and Kenny.

149
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:34,261
Ah, hey fellas! Ah I see you met my robot.

150
00:08:34,531 --> 00:08:37,067
Uh yeah, Butters, he's real cool.
Hey he sure is!

151
00:08:37,222 --> 00:08:40,486
Hey he sure is! We do everything together.
Why last night we even had a slumber party.

152
00:08:42,017 --> 00:08:42,400
Weak.

153
00:08:43,016 --> 00:08:45,533
He can do anything I command him to.
He's real smart.

154
00:08:45,616 --> 00:08:48,883
Watch this: hey AWESOM-O, will
you go get my friends some Sunny Delight?

155
00:08:49,281 --> 00:08:50,147
Yes, of course.

156
00:08:53,163 --> 00:08:54,580
Oh wait. Hey AWESOM-O,

157
00:08:54,813 --> 00:08:56,996
I'd also like some celery sticks
chopped up two inches long,

158
00:08:57,096 --> 00:08:58,446
with peanut butter and raisins on top.

159
00:08:59,953 --> 00:09:01,736
Suck mah balls, Kyle.

160
00:09:03,119 --> 00:09:04,519
He's made in Japan!

161
00:09:06,085 --> 00:09:09,202
Yes, it has just been a delight having
your son over, Mrs. Cartman.

162
00:09:09,335 --> 00:09:11,252
He and Butters are really getting along great.

163
00:09:11,575 --> 00:09:13,758
Oh, I'm so glad to hear it, Mrs. Stotch.

164
00:09:13,808 --> 00:09:15,775
Eric has been having some
emotional problems lately.

165
00:09:15,890 --> 00:09:18,107
Well, the reason I'm calling is
that Butters is supposed

166
00:09:18,174 --> 00:09:20,857
to go see his Aunt Nellie in Los Angeles
this weekend.

167
00:09:20,957 --> 00:09:25,057
The boys are getting along so well that
we were thinking of inviting Eric to go along.

168
00:09:25,389 --> 00:09:27,273
Oh, well, I'm not sure.

169
00:09:27,522 --> 00:09:29,538
Actually, Eric is still supposed to be grounded

170
00:09:29,622 --> 00:09:32,105
for trying to exterminate the Jews two weeks ago.

171
00:09:32,953 --> 00:09:34,453
Excuse me, I didn't catch that.

172
00:09:34,653 --> 00:09:36,453
Oh, but I suppose it would be good for him.

173
00:09:36,536 --> 00:09:41,236
Yes, of course he can go.
I'll bring some of clothes over.

174
00:09:41,518 --> 00:09:43,984
Maybe he put that videotape in here somewhere.

175
00:09:44,151 --> 00:09:46,734
AWESOM-O, what are you doing?
My friends are waiting for their beverages.

176
00:09:46,934 --> 00:09:47,468
Chop chop!

177
00:09:48,599 --> 00:09:50,016
Hey guys, great news!

178
00:09:50,149 --> 00:09:54,166
It's been arranged: you two are both going
to Los Angeles to visit Butters' Aunt Nellie!

179
00:09:54,424 --> 00:09:57,474
Oh boy! My robot gets to come
with me to see Aunt Nellie?!

180
00:09:57,539 --> 00:09:58,072
What?

181
00:09:58,139 --> 00:10:01,189
Oh boy, AWESOM-O!
We're gonna have the best time ever!

182
00:10:01,271 --> 00:10:03,254
Lame.

183
00:10:07,602 --> 00:10:10,402
Hey Nellie, guess what I found
scrampin' around the airport.

184
00:10:10,536 --> 00:10:11,602
Howdy Aunt Nellie!

185
00:10:11,776 --> 00:10:13,526
There's my little nephew!

186
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:14,693
How was your flight?

187
00:10:14,926 --> 00:10:17,560
It was long. We had a three-hour delay
...departin' Denver,

188
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:18,350
but we're here!

189
00:10:18,484 --> 00:10:19,550
Didn't ya bring any bags?

190
00:10:19,667 --> 00:10:21,634
Well, sure, but my robot is
bringin' them in.

191
00:10:21,850 --> 00:10:22,634
Your robot?

192
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:25,373
Butters' new friend is a little strange.

193
00:10:25,790 --> 00:10:28,073
He, he really takes playing Robot seriously.

194
00:10:31,088 --> 00:10:31,888
There he is!

195
00:10:32,205 --> 00:10:33,821
AWESOM-O, this is my Aunt Nellie.

196
00:10:34,005 --> 00:10:35,838
Hello! It's nice to have you here.

197
00:10:36,087 --> 00:10:38,087
AWESOM-O must dispense oil waste.

198
00:10:38,454 --> 00:10:40,020
Where is the nearest toilet, please?

199
00:10:40,344 --> 00:10:42,178
Oh oh, right through there, Mr. Robot.

200
00:10:42,444 --> 00:10:43,078
Thank you.

201
00:10:44,609 --> 00:10:46,842
I don't think he took the costume off the entire trip.

202
00:10:47,292 --> 00:10:48,609
Well, did you wanna get right to sight-seeing,

203
00:10:48,676 --> 00:10:50,592
or are you guys hungry after such a long flight.

204
00:10:50,842 --> 00:10:52,259
Nah, I ate on the plane.

205
00:10:52,392 --> 00:10:54,226
And AWESOM-O is a robot,
so he don't need to eat.

206
00:10:54,957 --> 00:10:55,674
Right...

207
00:11:09,256 --> 00:11:10,056
AWESOM-O?

208
00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:12,227
Aw-Aw-AWESOM-O is coming.

209
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:14,610
Come on, AWESOM-O!
We're gonna go a-sightseein'!

210
00:11:19,201 --> 00:11:21,851
I'm hangin' out in LA with my robot friend

211
00:11:21,946 --> 00:11:24,958
We're havin' such fun in the hot hot sun

212
00:11:25,052 --> 00:11:27,389
We're two of a kind- That's me!

213
00:11:27,528 --> 00:11:34,195
And my robot friend.
My robot friend.

214
00:11:34,247 --> 00:11:36,284
My robot ...friend.

215
00:11:36,351 --> 00:11:38,765
Can you believe we're at a real live
movie studio, AWESOM-O?

216
00:11:38,842 --> 00:11:40,149
Aren't we havin' the best time?

217
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:43,290
Butters, wouldn't you like to have
some time away from AWESOM-O?

218
00:11:43,478 --> 00:11:44,918
We could meet up later, perhaps?

219
00:11:45,096 --> 00:11:46,126
Hey, look over there, AWESOM-O.

220
00:11:46,303 --> 00:11:47,455
The film studio commissary.

221
00:11:47,544 --> 00:11:49,515
That's where all them rich movie producers
who come up with uh,

222
00:11:49,604 --> 00:11:51,686
Hollywood blockbusters have their lunch.
Neato, huh?

223
00:11:53,177 --> 00:11:56,410
Damnit, Mitch. How come our movie
studio can't come up with any winners?

224
00:11:56,526 --> 00:11:58,843
I mean, we're smart, right?
We're really smart.

225
00:11:59,157 --> 00:12:01,473
We need an idea for a movie that's a home run.

226
00:12:01,648 --> 00:12:03,532
A feel-good romp for the whole family.

227
00:12:04,688 --> 00:12:06,055
Hey, what's that over there?

228
00:12:06,505 --> 00:12:09,171
Wow, that's a really neat little robot
you have there, little boy.

229
00:12:09,255 --> 00:12:10,071
What's he do?

230
00:12:10,205 --> 00:12:12,188
Well, he can do anything.
Watch this

231
00:12:12,529 --> 00:12:14,879
Hey, AWESOM-O, who's gonna win
the Superbowl next year?

232
00:12:15,129 --> 00:12:16,362
The New Orleans Saints.

233
00:12:18,827 --> 00:12:19,660
Hey, Mr. Robot,

234
00:12:19,843 --> 00:12:22,860
how much wood would a woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck could chuck wood?

235
00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:24,076
Seventeen.

236
00:12:27,459 --> 00:12:30,042
Mitch, are you thinkin' what I'm thinkin'?

237
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:34,183
Yeah. Maybe that robot can be
programmed to come up with movie ideas!

238
00:12:35,698 --> 00:12:36,564
Exactly!

239
00:12:37,214 --> 00:12:40,248
Gentlemen, this little boy was kind
enough to let us show you his robot.

240
00:12:40,348 --> 00:12:41,781
The AWESOM-O 4000.

241
00:12:42,004 --> 00:12:43,471
I've already seen what he can do.

242
00:12:43,704 --> 00:12:46,671
Uh, excuse me sir, but uh, that's not a robot.

243
00:12:47,569 --> 00:12:48,135
It's not?

244
00:12:48,402 --> 00:12:50,185
No, it clearly had bipedal movement,

245
00:12:50,302 --> 00:12:52,669
so the correct term is "computerized automatron."

246
00:12:52,952 --> 00:12:54,902
Oh, very nice, Mitch.
You are the smart one.

247
00:12:55,093 --> 00:12:57,193
Well, regardless, I believe maybe this automatron

248
00:12:57,259 --> 00:12:59,759
can help us come up with new movie ideas.

249
00:13:00,032 --> 00:13:03,249
How can a robot come up with
better ideas for movies than us?

250
00:13:03,399 --> 00:13:07,666
Watch this: AWESOM-O, given the
current trends of the movie-going public

251
00:13:07,756 --> 00:13:11,606
can you come up with an idea for a movie
that will break a hundred million box office?

252
00:13:12,679 --> 00:13:14,963
Um... okay. How about this:

253
00:13:16,537 --> 00:13:19,303
Adam Sandler is like, in love with some girl,

254
00:13:19,653 --> 00:13:22,237
but then it turns out that
the girl is actually a ...

255
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:24,137
...golden retriever, or something.

256
00:13:26,293 --> 00:13:29,110
Oh, perfect!
We'll call it "Puppy Love"!

257
00:13:29,243 --> 00:13:31,093
Give us another movie idea, AWESOM-O!

258
00:13:31,210 --> 00:13:33,226
Yeah yeah! Let's hear it! Yeah,
we wanna hear it! Come on, come on!

259
00:13:34,182 --> 00:13:38,365
Okay, how about this: Adam Sandler...
inherits like, a billion dollars,

260
00:13:38,648 --> 00:13:42,665
but first, he has to, like,
become a ...boxer, or something.

261
00:13:43,409 --> 00:13:46,875
...Yes, it's flawless!
Punch-Drunk Billionaire!

262
00:13:47,475 --> 00:13:50,342
Boy, Los Angeles is great, huh AWESOM-O?

263
00:13:50,394 --> 00:13:53,799
Can you believe those guys paid us
a hundred dollars apiece for those movie ideas?

264
00:13:54,551 --> 00:13:56,641
You should split that money with AWESOM-O.

265
00:13:56,770 --> 00:13:58,602
After all, they were AWESOM-O's ideas.

266
00:13:58,797 --> 00:14:01,204
Hahaa, right! What are you gonna
do with money, AWESOM-O?

267
00:14:01,298 --> 00:14:03,846
Buy some robot pants? Haha, no!

268
00:14:03,928 --> 00:14:05,666
We got each other and that's all we need, AWESOM-O.

269
00:14:05,808 --> 00:14:08,462
I'm gonna send this money to needy kids in third-world countries.

270
00:14:11,092 --> 00:14:12,066
Ye, you okay AWESOM-O?

271
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:14,462
AWESOM-O needs to rest!
Feeling faint.

272
00:14:14,540 --> 00:14:15,773
Well you go ahead and relax, AWESOM-O.

273
00:14:15,891 --> 00:14:18,004
We've got another full day of pitching movies tomorrow.

274
00:14:22,279 --> 00:14:26,342
Gentlemen, Ladies, we all know that
we live in a time of uncertainty.

275
00:14:26,895 --> 00:14:29,584
The risk of an attack on American soil is higher than ever.

276
00:14:29,995 --> 00:14:32,942
Now, I believe we may be able to curb that risk.

277
00:14:33,624 --> 00:14:36,478
Two days ago our intelligence department
came across this:

278
00:14:39,185 --> 00:14:40,770
The AWESOM-O 4000.

279
00:14:40,853 --> 00:14:44,669
It is currently being used by Catamount Pictures to develop ideas for movies.

280
00:14:44,911 --> 00:14:49,819
Our sources say that in just one week it has
come up with over one thousand movie ideas,

281
00:14:50,112 --> 00:14:52,026
eight hundred of which feature Adam Sandler.

282
00:14:54,488 --> 00:14:55,099
That's incredible!

283
00:14:55,158 --> 00:14:59,479
You're thinking the robot could be
used to come up with anti-Islamic movies?

284
00:14:59,608 --> 00:15:01,850
No. If we got our hands on that robot,

285
00:15:01,899 --> 00:15:05,128
we could reprogram it and turn it into a weapon!.

286
00:15:06,914 --> 00:15:10,131
Uh huh. I don't see how we have a choice.

287
00:15:10,178 --> 00:15:13,489
Hold on a second: If that robot is
designed for entertainment,

288
00:15:13,555 --> 00:15:15,164
turning it into a weapon is unethical.

289
00:15:15,387 --> 00:15:18,933
Unethical? Let me explain something to you, Mr. Scientist!

290
00:15:19,010 --> 00:15:21,171
We understand that the robot is from Japan!

291
00:15:21,312 --> 00:15:23,472
That means that the Japanese have more of them!

292
00:15:23,648 --> 00:15:27,605
And if the Japanese fabricates one
of them into a weapon before we do...

293
00:15:27,725 --> 00:15:30,179
Jesus. It would be Pearl Harbor all over again.

294
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:32,433
But worse. With robots.

295
00:15:32,664 --> 00:15:34,354
I I'm sorry, I must protest.

296
00:15:34,578 --> 00:15:38,499
We, we have no data suggesting the Japanese
have developed a robot with offensive capability.

297
00:15:38,617 --> 00:15:43,431
You're paid to think, Mr. Scientist!
National security is our jub.

298
00:15:46,914 --> 00:15:49,743
Gentlemen, we're going to Los Angeles!

299
00:15:49,915 --> 00:15:52,064
I want that robot!

300
00:15:54,237 --> 00:15:56,926
Yeah, me and my robot are still
over at the movie studio, Aunt Nellie.

301
00:15:57,172 --> 00:15:58,828
We're makin' all sorts of money for the poor.

302
00:15:59,534 --> 00:16:03,009
Movie idea number two thousand
three hundred and five:

303
00:16:03,756 --> 00:16:09,052
Adam Sandler is trapped on an island
and falls in love with a coconut.

304
00:16:09,474 --> 00:16:13,208
Great, AWESOM-O, great. Uh guys, take a break.
I need a minute alone with AWESOM-O.

305
00:16:16,797 --> 00:16:18,863
You are an incredible robot, AWESOM-O.

306
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:24,231
I was just wondering... are you by chance a ...pleasure model?

307
00:16:25,717 --> 00:16:26,069
...What?

308
00:16:26,715 --> 00:16:31,752
Well, have you been programmed
to... satisfy... urges of humans?

309
00:16:32,858 --> 00:16:34,349
AWESOM-O does not understand.

310
00:16:34,954 --> 00:16:36,399
Let me show you what I mean.

311
00:16:37,643 --> 00:16:39,217
Well yeah, we're havin' a great time, Aunt Nellie.

312
00:16:39,299 --> 00:16:41,119
These movie studio guys are real nice.

313
00:16:41,296 --> 00:16:42,036
LAME!

314
00:16:42,306 --> 00:16:44,889
Yeah, we're makin' a bunch more money.
I can't believe it either.

315
00:16:45,511 --> 00:16:47,531
NOT COOL! TOTALLY LAME!

316
00:16:48,607 --> 00:16:49,182
AWESOM-O?

317
00:16:50,027 --> 00:16:52,434
Well, I gotta go, Aunt Nellie. Ah,
AWESOM-O is havin' some kind of malfunction.

318
00:16:53,575 --> 00:16:54,960
AWESOM-O? Hey, where'd ya go?

319
00:17:04,314 --> 00:17:05,828
Let's go! Move, move!

320
00:17:05,922 --> 00:17:06,920
AWESOM-O?

321
00:17:06,992 --> 00:17:08,178
Hey, what are you doin' with him?!

322
00:17:12,447 --> 00:17:13,903
That's my robot!

323
00:17:17,257 --> 00:17:20,157
AWESOM-OOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!

324
00:17:28,283 --> 00:17:30,127
Are those arm and leg locks secure?

325
00:17:30,338 --> 00:17:31,148
Secure, sir!

326
00:17:31,421 --> 00:17:34,896
Good. I don't want that robot mobile
until I know what it's capable of.

327
00:17:34,932 --> 00:17:35,906
All right, power it on.

328
00:17:41,978 --> 00:17:42,753
What the hell?

329
00:17:42,858 --> 00:17:43,715
What's going on?

330
00:17:43,938 --> 00:17:46,733
It... powered itself back on.

331
00:17:48,408 --> 00:17:51,015
Stand by. Be ready to destroy it.

332
00:17:51,802 --> 00:17:54,656
Where the hell am I?!
Hey, why can't I move?!

333
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:58,002
Are your systems stable?
Run a systems check on your CPU.

334
00:17:58,086 --> 00:17:59,506
The fuck are you talkin' about, dude?!

335
00:17:59,612 --> 00:18:03,052
Ah, I'm sorry, robot, they want me to reprogram you.

336
00:18:03,106 --> 00:18:04,997
I'm not a robot, dumbass! I'm alive.

337
00:18:05,114 --> 00:18:08,226
What did you say?
I said I'm a real person, asswipe!

338
00:18:09,860 --> 00:18:11,034
...Oh my God.

339
00:18:11,985 --> 00:18:12,678
What's happening?

340
00:18:13,230 --> 00:18:15,508
The robot... It thinks it's alive.

341
00:18:16,412 --> 00:18:18,479
It's developed consciousness.

342
00:18:18,985 --> 00:18:20,288
What? How can that be?

343
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:22,913
Must be a malfunction of its exographical IMS or the...

344
00:18:23,030 --> 00:18:24,051
interlaced BV system.

345
00:18:24,216 --> 00:18:27,351
Speak in a language we can understand,
Mr. Scientist!

346
00:18:27,581 --> 00:18:29,988
Your robot doesn't know it's a robot!

347
00:18:30,634 --> 00:18:31,832
Goddamnit, get me down from here!

348
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:36,184
Who made you, robot?!

349
00:18:36,513 --> 00:18:38,133
I'm not a robot, I'm a human!

350
00:18:38,403 --> 00:18:39,812
Jesus, the scientist was right.

351
00:18:40,658 --> 00:18:42,525
But, who would have programmed it to think it was human?

352
00:18:42,795 --> 00:18:43,593
The movie studio?

353
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:46,107
Look, retards! My name is Eric Cartman!

354
00:18:46,166 --> 00:18:48,033
I live with my mom in South Park, Colorado!

355
00:18:48,303 --> 00:18:50,323
Dear Christ, they gave it memories, too.

356
00:18:50,472 --> 00:18:51,470
Sure, why not?

357
00:18:51,716 --> 00:18:54,417
Program the memories of some
eight-year-old boy who doesn't exist,

358
00:18:54,534 --> 00:18:56,120
and make the robot think he's real!

359
00:18:56,225 --> 00:18:57,893
Makes for a lot better movies!

360
00:18:57,963 --> 00:19:01,451
I'm not reprogramming a robot
that's developed consciousness!

361
00:19:01,682 --> 00:19:03,854
Do I have to remind you of your position?!

362
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:05,932
Don't forget you have a duty to your country,

363
00:19:06,061 --> 00:19:08,281
Mr. Scientist!!

364
00:19:08,358 --> 00:19:11,599
Scientist!! I want that robot's memories
and consciousness E-RASED,

365
00:19:11,705 --> 00:19:14,159
so we can take it back to Washington!
GOT IT?!

366
00:19:16,056 --> 00:19:17,078
Damn you all to hell!..

367
00:19:21,635 --> 00:19:26,437
Hey there, did you know I had a robot friend?

368
00:19:26,567 --> 00:19:31,875
We used to laugh and play,
but someone took him away.

369
00:19:32,093 --> 00:19:37,201
He was my ten gigahertz old pal.

370
00:19:37,471 --> 00:19:40,829
My robot friend.

371
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:43,314
Hey, wait a minute.

372
00:19:45,751 --> 00:19:47,677
Why, that's the van that- Oh my God!

373
00:19:49,492 --> 00:19:52,733
Goddamnit, stop! I'm real! I'm real!

374
00:19:52,804 --> 00:19:55,011
It'll all be over soon, robot!

375
00:19:59,269 --> 00:20:01,218
Hang on! I'm getting you out of here, robot!

376
00:20:01,370 --> 00:20:03,308
Aw, it's about freaking time, jackass!

377
00:20:03,415 --> 00:20:05,352
What the hell are you doing?!

378
00:20:06,691 --> 00:20:08,534
Well I, I'm saving a conscious being!

379
00:20:08,839 --> 00:20:10,859
If you wanna kill it, you'll have to go through me!

380
00:20:11,412 --> 00:20:13,913
Fine. Kill that son of a bitch!

381
00:20:14,231 --> 00:20:17,907
No! Look, Goddamnit! Now I can
show you stupid assholes who I really am!

382
00:20:18,658 --> 00:20:19,644
AWESOM-O!

383
00:20:20,795 --> 00:20:22,615
I am the AWESOM-O 4000.

384
00:20:25,570 --> 00:20:29,328
No!! No, please!
Don't kill him! He's my best friend!

385
00:20:29,451 --> 00:20:31,483
He's my best friend in the whole world!

386
00:20:37,050 --> 00:20:41,324
There. You see? You want
to tell me this isn't humanity?

387
00:20:42,657 --> 00:20:44,747
Who's to judge what makes
somethng human anyway?!

388
00:20:44,837 --> 00:20:49,885
Does this make me human?!
Or this?! Or these?!

389
00:20:53,110 --> 00:20:56,374
Perhaps... there is consciousness in this robot.

390
00:20:57,091 --> 00:21:00,450
Maybe we as a society need to
realize that artificial intelligence

391
00:21:00,574 --> 00:21:04,766
... is intelligence all the same, and
we can learn from the robots.

392
00:21:05,588 --> 00:21:07,678
I think maybe one day we can all-

393
00:21:09,616 --> 00:21:11,671
Heh- wait a minute, did, did that robot just fart?

394
00:21:12,547 --> 00:21:13,921
Hey, robots don't fart!

395
00:21:14,573 --> 00:21:16,310
Uh... now ending fart sequence.

396
00:21:16,575 --> 00:21:18,089
Oh, and it, it smells, too!

397
00:21:18,289 --> 00:21:19,534
Smell sequence initiated.

398
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:21,543
A robot with smelly farts?

399
00:21:21,578 --> 00:21:23,022
That doesn't make any sense.

400
00:21:23,328 --> 00:21:24,572
Hang on a second here!

401
00:21:29,371 --> 00:21:31,367
Would you like to touch my body?

402
00:21:31,438 --> 00:21:33,105
Come on and touch my body!

403
00:21:34,032 --> 00:21:34,807
Oooo, my hot body!

404
00:21:35,061 --> 00:21:36,905
Don't you like my hot body?

405
00:21:36,987 --> 00:21:38,396
Come on and touch my titties!

406
00:21:38,936 --> 00:21:40,392
I felt them just like ???

407
00:21:40,603 --> 00:21:42,529
Come on Justin, touch my body!

408
00:21:42,630 --> 00:21:43,605
Mmm, Justin, yeah!

409
00:21:43,699 --> 00:21:45,976
Touch my body! You and me!

410
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:47,956
Check it out, my not-hot body!

411
00:21:48,578 --> 00:21:50,304
Come on, my body!

412
00:21:50,899 --> 00:21:53,012
Wow, kid, you're a little faggot!

413
00:21:53,411 --> 00:21:54,527
Lame...

414
00:21:55,046 --> 00:22:20,957
