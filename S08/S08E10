1
00:00:34,349 --> 00:00:36,769
Yeah, and it was called Man from Atlantis,
and he had like, webbed fingers...

2
00:00:37,191 --> 00:00:38,944
Kyle, Kenny! I have to talk to you right now!

3
00:00:39,218 --> 00:00:40,160
Okay, hang on a second I-

4
00:00:40,292 --> 00:00:41,032
RIGHT NOW, GODDAMNIT!

5
00:00:41,234 --> 00:00:41,871
All right, all right!

6
00:00:43,706 --> 00:00:44,497
Dude, what is the matter with you?

7
00:00:45,739 --> 00:00:47,773
Trent Boyett is being released from Juvenile Hall.

8
00:00:49,517 --> 00:00:49,931
(WHAT??)

9
00:00:50,323 --> 00:00:51,637
Trent Boyett??
 The kid from preschool??

10
00:00:51,976 --> 00:00:53,095
Yeah. He just got paroled.

11
00:00:54,455 --> 00:00:55,767
Oh no! NO!

12
00:00:56,668 --> 00:00:57,795
Hey gaybots, what's goin' on?

13
00:00:58,817 --> 00:01:00,469
Trent Boyett is being released from Juvenile Hall.

14
00:01:00,885 --> 00:01:02,017
Really? That's cool. When did-?

15
00:01:03,646 --> 00:01:04,096
What did you say?

16
00:01:05,357 --> 00:01:09,450
Trent Boyett? Meanest, dirtiest, toughest kid in the world,
super-pissed off at US Trent Boyett??

17
00:01:09,729 --> 00:01:10,247
Yeah.

18
00:01:11,034 --> 00:01:12,452
Oh, Holy Jesus, God is...

19
00:01:13,228 --> 00:01:14,032
What the hell are we gonna do??

20
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:16,621
Hey, is it true?? 
Trent Boyett is getting out??

21
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:18,045
It's true.

22
00:01:18,681 --> 00:01:20,842
Oh Jesus, Oh Christ in Heaven, I gotta hide!

23
00:01:23,635 --> 00:01:24,660
Uh, oh boy!

24
00:01:27,562 --> 00:01:29,315
He's gonna come for us, you guys.
We are dead men.

25
00:01:29,589 --> 00:01:33,110
Look, m-maybe he's forgiven us.
I mean, we were only in preschool

26
00:01:40,070 --> 00:01:41,653
Dude, let's play Fireman.

27
00:01:42,352 --> 00:01:44,403
Totally, dude, let's play Fireman.

28
00:01:44,932 --> 00:01:46,755
Jews can't be firemen.

29
00:01:47,253 --> 00:01:48,445
Shut up, fatass!

30
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:51,076
Don't call me fat, you stupid Jew!

31
00:01:51,841 --> 00:01:53,457
(How about we put a real fire out?)

32
00:01:53,719 --> 00:01:57,587
Hey, Kenny's right. We should put out a i>real fire.
Then we'll be heroes!

33
00:01:58,066 --> 00:01:59,779
But how do we start a fire?

34
00:02:00,528 --> 00:02:03,915
Trent Boyett will do it.
He's the toughest, baddest kid in preschool!

35
00:02:05,913 --> 00:02:06,736
Say Encore!

36
00:02:07,109 --> 00:02:07,712
Encore!

37
00:02:08,711 --> 00:02:09,544
Say Encore!

38
00:02:09,908 --> 00:02:10,800
Encore!

39
00:02:12,725 --> 00:02:14,188
What do you shitheads want?!

40
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:16,395
Do you know how to start a fire?

41
00:02:17,502 --> 00:02:19,711
Sure! I burn lots stuff.

42
00:02:20,213 --> 00:02:21,911
Start one.
Then we're gonna put it out.

43
00:02:22,398 --> 00:02:23,181
We're firemen!

44
00:02:24,183 --> 00:02:26,966
Do you fuckheads even
know how to put out a fire?

45
00:02:27,768 --> 00:02:29,864
Yeah yeah, we play Fireman all the time.

46
00:02:30,486 --> 00:02:31,820
Don't worry, Trent.

47
00:02:32,685 --> 00:02:34,052
All right, fine.

48
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,796
Hey fellas, you'd better be careful.

49
00:02:40,249 --> 00:02:42,693
Shut up, Butters! 
We know what we're doing!

50
00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:44,298
Oh, all right then.

51
00:02:47,024 --> 00:02:47,968
Wow, cool!

52
00:02:48,512 --> 00:02:50,520
Code 7! Bring in the firemen!

53
00:02:51,409 --> 00:02:54,112
Woowoowoowoo, Clang clang clang clang clang!

54
00:02:54,312 --> 00:02:55,724
Come on, firemen! Put out the fire!

55
00:02:59,513 --> 00:03:00,143
We're heroes!

56
00:03:00,730 --> 00:03:01,806
We saved the school.

57
00:03:04,267 --> 00:03:04,881
Put it out!

58
00:03:05,730 --> 00:03:07,145
Trent Boyett, what have you done now?!

59
00:03:07,723 --> 00:03:08,821
They said they could put it out.

60
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:10,558
Children, get back away, now!

61
00:03:14,111 --> 00:03:15,512
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!

62
00:03:16,127 --> 00:03:17,548
I'm buuurniiing!

63
00:03:18,324 --> 00:03:19,350
Put it out, put it out!

64
00:03:28,566 --> 00:03:30,174
Come on, hurry!
We've gotta get her to the hospital!

65
00:03:33,062 --> 00:03:35,593
Dude, we are in so much trouble!

66
00:03:35,715 --> 00:03:37,019
My mon is gonna break my legs!

67
00:03:37,468 --> 00:03:40,578
Hey, we didn't start the fire, Trent Boyett did.

68
00:03:41,167 --> 00:03:41,892
That's true.

69
00:03:43,181 --> 00:03:46,269
You boys! Trent is trying to
tell us the fire was YOUR idea.

70
00:03:46,627 --> 00:03:47,170
No!

71
00:03:47,512 --> 00:03:49,049
Not us. We're good kids.

72
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:52,025
Tell them it was an accident:
you thought you could put it out.

73
00:03:52,519 --> 00:03:54,678
Trent Boyett is a liar, sir.

74
00:03:55,607 --> 00:04:00,355
I thought so. All right, that's it, Trent. You're
going to Juvenile Hall for a long time!

75
00:04:00,773 --> 00:04:03,137
Butters, you saw!
 Tell them what happened!

76
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:09,514
Ah, I'd do you in, Trent. Ah, I don't wanna get involved.
Or else my parents will ground me.

77
00:04:09,772 --> 00:04:14,805
You'd better pray I never get out of Juvenile Hall!
You'd better ALL pray!

78
00:04:18,406 --> 00:04:21,948
Dude, when he gets out of Juvenile Hall,
he's gonna wanna kill us!

79
00:04:22,482 --> 00:04:25,792
Whatever. That's like five years from now.

80
00:04:26,076 --> 00:04:27,327
Yeah, who cares?

81
00:04:27,669 --> 00:04:30,878
All right, yeah, woohoo, we did it!

82
00:04:33,104 --> 00:04:36,131
Now it's five years later.
And Trent Boyett is being released.

83
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:39,079
Oh Jesus, he's gonna kill us.
We-we've gotta tell our parents!

84
00:04:39,309 --> 00:04:43,086
We can't tell our parents, dude! We lied to everybody!
Nobody knows we're responsible for Ms.

85
00:04:43,211 --> 00:04:43,834
Claridge's accident!

86
00:04:44,022 --> 00:04:45,026
Sshhh, here comes Ms. Claridge now.

87
00:04:48,336 --> 00:04:49,638
Hello, Ms. Claridge.

88
00:04:52,392 --> 00:04:53,936
Are you having a nice day, Ms. Claridge?

89
00:04:59,667 --> 00:05:03,432
You guys, what the fuck are we gonna do?! In case you've forgotten,
Trent Boyett is the meanest kid we ever knew.

90
00:05:03,584 --> 00:05:04,394
He's gonna tear us apart!

91
00:05:04,597 --> 00:05:07,670
Look, that was a long time ago. Maybe Trent
Boyett has forgotten all about it.

92
00:05:30,489 --> 00:05:34,195
Everything that you had when you were first
brought in here will now be returned.

93
00:05:36,021 --> 00:05:42,246
One Crayole eight-pack with crayon sharpener.
One pair of plastic round-tipped scissors.

94
00:05:43,315 --> 00:05:47,823
One marble, blue. And one

95
00:05:48,644 --> 00:05:54,349
switchblade knife with "Kill all betrayers"
written on the blade, black.

96
00:05:59,610 --> 00:06:01,696
Trent! Where are you gonna go?

97
00:06:03,143 --> 00:06:04,970
I gots business to take care of.

98
00:06:14,151 --> 00:06:14,630
Hah!

99
00:06:16,885 --> 00:06:17,317
Butters?

100
00:06:19,832 --> 00:06:21,714
Hullo. Oh, uh hi Dad.

101
00:06:22,813 --> 00:06:24,052
Butters, what is wrong with you??

102
00:06:25,263 --> 00:06:26,865
Nothin' wrong, sir. Eh nothin' at all.

103
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:31,077
You've been shut up in your room for days, Butters.
You need to go outside, go play.

104
00:06:31,667 --> 00:06:33,652
Uh... outside? No way!

105
00:06:34,103 --> 00:06:34,806
Why not?

106
00:06:35,129 --> 00:06:35,752
N-no reason!

107
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:39,689
Butters, we have had it with your moping around!
You're gonna go outside and you're gonna play,

108
00:06:39,897 --> 00:06:40,288
right now!

109
00:06:40,591 --> 00:06:41,749
But Dad, I just wanna stay in my room-

110
00:06:46,817 --> 00:06:47,712
Butters, play!

111
00:06:49,722 --> 00:06:51,647
Start playing right now, young man!

112
00:07:06,059 --> 00:07:08,500
Tru... Tr-Trent Boyett! HAAA!

113
00:07:09,648 --> 00:07:12,076
Dad! Mom! I'm don- I'm done playin' now!

114
00:07:14,983 --> 00:07:16,390
AAAAAH! Let me in, Dad!

115
00:07:18,359 --> 00:07:20,199
Mom, Dad, you gotta open the door!

116
00:07:20,409 --> 00:07:22,265
What on earth is the matter with him?

117
00:07:22,814 --> 00:07:26,075
Just keep the door locked, honey. Butters
can't be a house hermit his whole life.

118
00:07:26,437 --> 00:07:28,951
Oh my God, he's coming!
Oh here oh my gosh he's gonna kill me!

119
00:07:29,410 --> 00:07:32,745
I just can't stand to hear him scream like that.
I'm gonna go upstairs.

120
00:07:33,943 --> 00:07:36,378
Mom, Dad, you gotta open
the door right now! You've gotta open it-

121
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:43,830
Oh hey! Trent Boyett Gosh
I... haven't seen you in a whle.

122
00:07:45,714 --> 00:07:48,780
Five years. It's been five long miserable years.

123
00:07:49,162 --> 00:07:53,105
Look, Trent, I know- I know you're awful sore about.
.. pre- muh- pr-preschool and all,

124
00:07:53,498 --> 00:07:56,196
but... well that was a long time ago.
I mean, we were just kids.

125
00:07:58,057 --> 00:08:01,170
Uhhh... p-lease don't hurt me, Trent.
I-I'll give you anything you want.

126
00:08:01,458 --> 00:08:01,889
You name it!

127
00:08:02,121 --> 00:08:04,347
Can you give me back my time? 
Huh? Can you do that??

128
00:08:04,646 --> 00:08:07,344
Kindergarten, first grade, second? 
Can you give me that??

129
00:08:08,805 --> 00:08:11,268
Well, no, Trent,
I-I'm not like a time-traveler or nothin'.

130
00:08:12,056 --> 00:08:14,796
I'm gonna give you something you didn't
give me: a five-second head-start.

131
00:08:15,046 --> 00:08:17,523
No, Trent, I I ain't gonna run.
We can talk this through.

132
00:08:17,756 --> 00:08:18,286
Four seconds!

133
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:19,774
Uh Trent, now, listen to me.
I'm sorry for the color-

134
00:08:19,905 --> 00:08:20,255
Three seconds!

135
00:08:20,550 --> 00:08:21,189
Ohhh yamuckers!

136
00:08:25,749 --> 00:08:29,486
Thanks so much for coming to visit Butters in the hospital,
boys. It means a lot to him.

137
00:08:34,358 --> 00:08:35,291
What happened to him, Doctor?

138
00:08:35,843 --> 00:08:38,885
>From the test results, it would appear
your child was tortured by a bully.

139
00:08:39,568 --> 00:08:40,871
He received a massive snuggie,

140
00:08:41,257 --> 00:08:43,047
his underwear pulled up so high it nearly killed him.

141
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:46,104
He also received two Indian
sunburns on his forearms,

142
00:08:46,951 --> 00:08:51,450
a charlie horse on the thigh, and a second-degree titty twister.
And from the damage to his head area,

143
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:54,348
it appears he was also given a swirly,
a colossal one.

144
00:08:56,533 --> 00:09:00,587
It also appears like he received a noogie,
and, a Polish bike ride.

145
00:09:01,481 --> 00:09:01,990
What's that?

146
00:09:02,534 --> 00:09:05,327
We aren't sure.
We only know that... there is no cure.

147
00:09:05,843 --> 00:09:07,303
If only we had let him in!

148
00:09:07,883 --> 00:09:10,275
Why didn't we let him inside
the house when he was screaming for help?

149
00:09:10,730 --> 00:09:12,373
Now, honey, we were trying to read.

150
00:09:13,241 --> 00:09:15,860
We've got to tell them who did this, you guys.
We're gonna get it as bad as Butters!

151
00:09:16,033 --> 00:09:19,405
That's nothing compared to what my mom will do to me
if she finds out I've been lying for five years!

152
00:09:19,895 --> 00:09:22,843
Maybe you didn't hear so good in there,
Kyle! Second-degree titty-twister!

153
00:09:23,054 --> 00:09:26,919
Calm down guys, we don't have to go tell our parents.
We just need to go out and get some protection.

154
00:09:27,558 --> 00:09:29,093
How the hell are condoms gonna help us?!

155
00:09:31,634 --> 00:09:33,337
Sorry, heh. Never mind, heh.

156
00:09:34,529 --> 00:09:37,568
I'm talking about hiring somebody bigger
than Trent to protect us from him.

157
00:09:37,817 --> 00:09:38,188
Come on!

158
00:09:42,714 --> 00:09:44,063
I'm gonna jump the wall of fire.

159
00:09:48,533 --> 00:09:49,694
Yeah, that was sweat!

160
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:52,191
Hey, look!

161
00:09:54,424 --> 00:09:55,628
Dude, we shouldn't be here!

162
00:09:56,185 --> 00:09:59,616
Stay cool, guys. If anybody can protect us from Trent Boyett,
it's the sixth graders.

163
00:10:00,408 --> 00:10:01,886
Stupic little Fourthies!

164
00:10:15,260 --> 00:10:17,998
What are you little
Fourthies doin' in our hangout?!

165
00:10:19,971 --> 00:10:22,213
We've come to... ask you for help.

166
00:10:22,855 --> 00:10:23,407
Help???

167
00:10:27,115 --> 00:10:29,712
We need you to protect us... from a bully.

168
00:10:30,268 --> 00:10:32,151
Yeah? And what do we get for it?

169
00:10:34,718 --> 00:10:39,380
A twelve-pack of Dr. Pepper, A Shoots
& Ladders game used only three times,

170
00:10:40,611 --> 00:10:41,933
DVD of Harry Potter 2,

171
00:10:42,749 --> 00:10:46,401
and a coupon for a free side of fries with a purchase
of any deloxe hamburger at Red Robin.

172
00:10:47,561 --> 00:10:48,807
All this can be yours.

173
00:10:52,499 --> 00:10:55,005
You're gonna have to do better than that, Fourthies!

174
00:10:56,076 --> 00:10:56,433
Well...

175
00:10:56,729 --> 00:10:57,365
Well, what do you want?

176
00:10:57,721 --> 00:10:59,680
You're Stan Marsh, right?

177
00:11:00,767 --> 00:11:01,154
Yeah.

178
00:11:01,530 --> 00:11:02,855
OOOOOoooOoOooo!

179
00:11:04,786 --> 00:11:07,209
We want a picture of your mom's boobs!

180
00:11:07,662 --> 00:11:09,598
Yeah. Awesome.

181
00:11:09,830 --> 00:11:10,388
WHAT??

182
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:12,465
Your mom has the sweetest bewbs ever.

183
00:11:12,758 --> 00:11:14,994
Yeah! I totally wanna suck your mom's tits.

184
00:11:15,328 --> 00:11:15,901
Dude, weak!

185
00:11:16,367 --> 00:11:18,686
Come back with a naked
picture of your mom!

186
00:11:20,025 --> 00:11:20,511
NO!

187
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:22,665
Then we aren't helpin' you!

188
00:11:23,711 --> 00:11:24,896
Wait! We'll do it.

189
00:11:25,975 --> 00:11:28,074
It'd have to be a good picture, too!

190
00:11:32,096 --> 00:11:33,753
So long, Fourthies!

191
00:11:38,651 --> 00:11:43,030
Okay, so now we just need to get
a picture of Stan's mom naked. Cool.

192
00:11:52,304 --> 00:11:54,472
That's the preschool teacher, 
Ms. Claridge.

193
00:11:54,802 --> 00:11:58,318
 Poor woman suffered
such horrible burns she can only communicate by.

194
00:11:58,342 --> 00:12:00,125
.. beeping once for yes and twice for no.

195
00:12:02,739 --> 00:12:04,688
Oh hello, Ms. Claridge. Nice day, isn't it?

196
00:12:06,607 --> 00:12:08,010
Need help across the street, Ms. Claridge?

197
00:12:10,386 --> 00:12:11,168
Well all right then.

198
00:12:25,737 --> 00:12:26,639
Ms. Claridge, you all right?

199
00:12:29,516 --> 00:12:32,896
You can talk to me, Ms. Claridge. I understand:
one beep for yes and two for no.

200
00:12:33,234 --> 00:12:34,707
Don't you think you should get out of the street?

201
00:12:37,369 --> 00:12:39,362
Look you, you don't have to be so cold.
I'm just trying to help.

202
00:12:42,752 --> 00:12:44,546
Oooo, sorry!

203
00:12:58,010 --> 00:12:59,969
Can Kyle come out and play?

204
00:13:00,809 --> 00:13:02,635
Oh, Kyle isn't home right now, hon.

205
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:04,227
Thank you, ma'am.

206
00:13:10,145 --> 00:13:14,803
You see, Mom, all the kids at school were told to bring
a picture of their moms' breasts for anatomy class.

207
00:13:15,178 --> 00:13:17,093
I don't know, son. That sounds awfully strange.

208
00:13:17,371 --> 00:13:18,835
You cannot have a picture of my hot breasts.

209
00:13:19,481 --> 00:13:20,445
But mom, my teacher will-

210
00:13:20,658 --> 00:13:21,635
Nononono, you gotta go

211
00:13:21,903 --> 00:13:23,189
"But Mo-o-o-om."

212
00:13:24,541 --> 00:13:25,501
But Mo-o-o-

213
00:13:25,753 --> 00:13:27,783
"But Mo-o-o-om."

214
00:13:28,604 --> 00:13:29,240
This is hopeless!

215
00:13:29,458 --> 00:13:32,279
Why don't you just sneak in your mom's closet and
get a picture when she's changing clothes?

216
00:13:32,590 --> 00:13:34,531
That's sick, dude! I'm not taking
 a picture of my mom's boobs!

217
00:13:34,897 --> 00:13:35,411
(I'll do it.)

218
00:13:35,650 --> 00:13:39,177
No, you're not doing it either! We just need to find something
that looks like boobs to take a picture of.

219
00:13:39,505 --> 00:13:41,211
What else has big round squishy globes?

220
00:13:43,833 --> 00:13:46,522
Draw the um- You guys draw the nipples
like on the bottom of my asscheecks.

221
00:13:46,927 --> 00:13:48,538
No, the nipples are more in the middle, see?

222
00:13:48,863 --> 00:13:51,702
Yeah, but Stan's mom is old; that means her nipples.
.. sag more to the bottom now.

223
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:52,702
How do you know?!

224
00:13:53,008 --> 00:13:54,406
Will you guys trust me? 
I know this stuff!

225
00:13:54,854 --> 00:13:55,462
All right, fine.

226
00:14:00,317 --> 00:14:01,306
Oh wait! We forgot the necklace.

227
00:14:01,709 --> 00:14:02,234
(Oh yeah!)

228
00:14:11,149 --> 00:14:11,866
God I hope this works.

229
00:14:17,233 --> 00:14:17,713
Escuse me!

230
00:14:19,424 --> 00:14:20,231
Whattaya want now?!

231
00:14:21,197 --> 00:14:22,075
We, we got it.

232
00:14:23,342 --> 00:14:25,134
You got a picture of your mom's bewbs?

233
00:14:26,020 --> 00:14:26,698
No way!

234
00:14:32,064 --> 00:14:33,672
Hey, hold on a second!

235
00:14:34,633 --> 00:14:37,273
These are like the hottest
tits I've evern seen!

236
00:14:37,743 --> 00:14:38,324
Whoa!

237
00:14:38,491 --> 00:14:39,209
Check them out!

238
00:14:39,477 --> 00:14:40,235
Give me that!

239
00:14:40,995 --> 00:14:43,667
Whoa! I knew she had a hot rack!

240
00:14:44,274 --> 00:14:46,200
Yeah. Sure does. Uh-huh! Uh-huh!

241
00:14:46,780 --> 00:14:47,663
Oh yeah, those are so hot.

242
00:14:48,425 --> 00:14:49,392
Oooohhh

243
00:14:51,728 --> 00:14:53,671
Okay, so now you'll help
us take care of Trent Boyett?

244
00:14:54,923 --> 00:14:59,349
Oh all right, we'll let this Trent Boyett
know that if he messes with you,

245
00:14:59,566 --> 00:15:00,690
he's messin' with us!

246
00:15:01,324 --> 00:15:02,115
All right!

247
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:04,852
You guys, we're free!
We haven't a care in the world!

248
00:15:04,979 --> 00:15:05,537
(All right!)

249
00:15:05,955 --> 00:15:08,107
I need three minutes alone
with the picture behind the bushes.

250
00:15:08,592 --> 00:15:10,445
I get to take the picture
behind the bushes after you.

251
00:15:11,085 --> 00:15:12,792
I'm takin' it to the bushes first!

252
00:15:14,483 --> 00:15:15,881
Dude, are we gonna be like that someday?

253
00:15:16,912 --> 00:15:17,454
Naw.

254
00:15:22,506 --> 00:15:26,429
Man, I would have loved to seen to seen the look on Trent
Boyett's face when all the sixth graders showed up!

255
00:15:26,679 --> 00:15:29,199
Yeah. Trent's just lucky he didn't mess with us.
I woulda kicked his ass.

256
00:15:29,603 --> 00:15:30,971
Hey, look. What is Ms. Claridge doing?

257
00:15:33,547 --> 00:15:34,147
Ms. Claridge?

258
00:15:34,868 --> 00:15:38,976
She won't talk to anybody, boys.
Some say... she's just given up hope.

259
00:15:43,779 --> 00:15:45,615
Hey guys, you know what we should do?
We should go get a-

260
00:15:46,029 --> 00:15:46,619
Hwuh?!

261
00:15:57,616 --> 00:16:01,214
Jesus Christ, I've never seen so many Indian
sunburns and titty twisters in my life!

262
00:16:01,850 --> 00:16:03,136
Get a cold towel on that pink belly!

263
00:16:03,887 --> 00:16:05,184
Doctor, we have another snuggie here

264
00:16:05,441 --> 00:16:06,046
Over there!

265
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:10,528
Another wet willie?

266
00:16:10,803 --> 00:16:11,724
Worst one yet.

267
00:16:12,055 --> 00:16:12,825
It's all

268
00:16:15,628 --> 00:16:16,850
Give the poor kid some morphine.

269
00:16:19,599 --> 00:16:20,131
Dude, what happened?

270
00:16:21,198 --> 00:16:25,929
We... told him not to mess with you guys.
.. We told him... you paid us.

271
00:16:26,551 --> 00:16:28,159
Oh, Jesus. You told him that?!

272
00:16:29,387 --> 00:16:33,287
Boys, you have to let him rest. Some
mean kid gave him a Texas Chili Bowl

273
00:16:33,894 --> 00:16:34,395
What's that?

274
00:16:34,811 --> 00:16:37,063
It involves Tabasco sauce,
a telephone, and the anus.

275
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:40,952
I don't know what kind of kid
 would do this to other people;

276
00:16:41,001 --> 00:16:44,804
I only know that I wouldn't ever want
 to be on that kid's bad side.

277
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:50,810
We're dead. Trent knows we send
the sixth-graders after him.

278
00:16:51,460 --> 00:16:53,034
He's gonna give us all Texas chili bowls.

279
00:16:54,382 --> 00:16:57,190
We've gotta move away. We've gotta get as
far away from this town as possible!

280
00:16:57,376 --> 00:16:58,600
No, no, we've just gotta find better help.

281
00:16:58,918 --> 00:17:02,255
From who? We can't ask adults for help and
there's nobody tougher than sixth graders.

282
00:17:03,778 --> 00:17:05,371
There is... one person.

283
00:17:13,132 --> 00:17:13,588
Shelley?

284
00:17:14,112 --> 00:17:16,088
Shut up, turd! I'm watching television!

285
00:17:19,074 --> 00:17:22,319
Shelley, you're my sister, right? And families.
.. depend on each other.

286
00:17:22,592 --> 00:17:25,751
I said shut up, 
or I will destroy you, tur-r-rd!

287
00:17:26,908 --> 00:17:27,384
Shelley

288
00:17:27,907 --> 00:17:31,364
Somebody is going to kill me, 
and I can't go to Mom or Dad for help,

289
00:17:31,364 --> 00:17:34,641
so, you're kind of the only person I have... left.

290
00:17:41,766 --> 00:17:46,364
STOP CRYING, TURD!!
Now, who's gonna kill you?

291
00:17:47,015 --> 00:17:50,336
Trent Boyett. He just got released from Juvenile Hall.
He was sent there for burning Ms.

292
00:17:50,455 --> 00:17:52,131
Claridge, but actually, it was our fault.

293
00:17:52,382 --> 00:17:54,417
Oh, you are such stupid turds.

294
00:17:54,681 --> 00:17:57,914
We were only four years old at the time, uh. We du-we didn't
think about the past coming back to haunt us then.

295
00:17:58,163 --> 00:17:59,718
We didn't think and now he's gonna kill us!

296
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:04,713
Calm down, turd! No Juvenile Hall turd is going to kill you.
That's my job.

297
00:18:05,026 --> 00:18:05,744
So you're gonna help us?

298
00:18:06,159 --> 00:18:08,103
Yes, but I'm gonna want something in return.

299
00:18:09,052 --> 00:18:10,079
A picture of your mom's boobs?

300
00:18:10,506 --> 00:18:13,790
SHUT UP, TURD! You're going to admit
 to Ms. Claridge what you did!

301
00:18:14,149 --> 00:18:14,960
Admit it was our fault?

302
00:18:15,429 --> 00:18:19,524
You can't run from your past, turds.
 Apologize and make amends.

303
00:18:19,524 --> 00:18:21,944
Then I'll protect you from this Trent turd.

304
00:18:33,411 --> 00:18:36,480
Ms. Claridge, the people in town 
are really worried about you.

305
00:18:39,098 --> 00:18:43,556
Look, if you're having some kind of problem,
you have to be able to talk to people.

306
00:18:46,394 --> 00:18:50,675
Just tell us this: do you trust that we want what's best for you,
yes or no?

307
00:18:53,214 --> 00:18:56,517
All right, fine! But someday you're gonna
have to learn to let people in!

308
00:18:58,400 --> 00:18:59,030
Bitch.

309
00:19:03,769 --> 00:19:06,214
Hi, Ms. Claridge. Uh, we have s-someting to tell you.

310
00:19:08,562 --> 00:19:11,872
The thing is, Ms. Claridge, we did a lot
of stupid things when we were kids.

311
00:19:12,235 --> 00:19:14,006
A lot of stupid things that we regret.

312
00:19:14,389 --> 00:19:15,763
(And it's time for us to come clean.)

313
00:19:18,112 --> 00:19:21,704
See, Ms. Claridge, when we were little,
we used to play with our weiners a lot,

314
00:19:22,101 --> 00:19:23,797
and one game we played was "Fireman."

315
00:19:25,058 --> 00:19:26,089
I've been lookin' for you!

316
00:19:27,757 --> 00:19:29,678
Firve years I've been waitin' for this day.

317
00:19:29,868 --> 00:19:31,084
AAAAAAAAH!

318
00:19:31,655 --> 00:19:33,340
Trent, look: We've realized our mistake!

319
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:37,010
Yes, our conscious got the best of us and, and
we were just about to tell everyone the truth.

320
00:19:37,708 --> 00:19:41,980
You had five years to do that. And while I wasted
away my time in prison you've been enjoying nice,

321
00:19:42,274 --> 00:19:42,880
normal lives!

322
00:19:43,303 --> 00:19:45,137
Our lives have not been enjoyable, Trent! I promise you!

323
00:19:45,452 --> 00:19:47,822
Don't tell me that! I heard about
 the things you've done!

324
00:19:47,855 --> 00:19:50,587
But there WERE no magical Christmas 
adventures or talking poo for me!

325
00:19:50,611 --> 00:19:53,363
I didn't get to fight a huge 
mechanized Barbra Streisand like you did!

326
00:19:53,402 --> 00:19:55,797
No accidental trips to Afghanistan for Trent Boyett!

327
00:19:56,499 --> 00:19:57,483
Stay away from us, Trent!

328
00:19:58,102 --> 00:19:58,573
What is that?

329
00:19:58,753 --> 00:20:00,617
It's my mom's taser. 
I took it from her purse.

330
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:01,813
Just back off, man!

331
00:20:03,401 --> 00:20:07,223
Look, just take your punishment! You deserve it! Let
me have my retribution and it can be over with.

332
00:20:07,452 --> 00:20:10,519
I am NOT going to have a titty twister!
 I hate titty twisters!

333
00:20:10,789 --> 00:20:12,013
You don't even know how to use that!

334
00:20:22,948 --> 00:20:23,488
Wow!

335
00:20:48,143 --> 00:20:51,101
So, Trent, you just had to finish
 off your old preschool teacher, eh?

336
00:20:51,682 --> 00:20:52,335
No! They did it!

337
00:20:53,950 --> 00:20:55,244
Trent Boyett is a liar, sir.

338
00:20:57,414 --> 00:21:01,342
Ms. Claridge, did Trent Boyett do this to you.

339
00:21:02,309 --> 00:21:03,545
Yes yes. Take him away!

340
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:05,173
Naw! You've gotta listen to me!

341
00:21:07,382 --> 00:21:08,885
Dude, when he gets out he's gonna be really mad!

342
00:21:09,249 --> 00:21:10,749
Whatever, that's like five years from now.

343
00:21:11,090 --> 00:21:11,902
Yeah, who cares?

344
00:21:12,197 --> 00:21:13,645
Yeah, woohoo

345
00:21:13,808 --> 00:21:14,168
We did it!

346
00:21:15,495 --> 00:21:17,268
So long, Trent! Have a nice time!

347
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:18,902
Nyanyanyanyanyaaanyaaa!

348
00:21:19,878 --> 00:21:20,714
Hahahahahaaahaaa!

349
00:21:23,509 --> 00:21:24,882
Hey, hold on a second!

350
00:21:25,446 --> 00:21:25,809
Uh oh.

351
00:21:26,128 --> 00:21:26,969
Bewbs!

352
00:21:27,294 --> 00:21:28,151
Omigod!

353
00:21:29,265 --> 00:21:29,503
Boobs!

354
00:21:29,721 --> 00:21:30,635
I'm taking them to the bushes!

355
00:21:30,853 --> 00:21:31,753
I'm taking them to the bushes first!

356
00:21:32,514 --> 00:21:33,272
Hah! Hey!

357
00:21:33,514 --> 00:21:35,272
