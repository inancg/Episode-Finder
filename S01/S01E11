00:00:03.71,00:00:08.01
That was a hoot and a holler![br]Did you like that, South Parketeers?

00:00:08.21,00:00:12.67
You'll love this next episode.[br]It's our favorite. "Tom's Rhinoplasty."

00:00:12.85,00:00:14.75
Mr. Garrison gets a nose job...

00:00:14.92,00:00:17.72
...a substitute teacher comes[br]to South Park...

00:00:17.89,00:00:20.19
...and our boys learn[br]how to lick carpet.

00:00:20.36,00:00:24.76
It's our favorite episode because[br]we got Natasha Henstridge...

00:00:24.93,00:00:30.03
...to be the voice of the substitute[br]teacher. She was in the movie Species.

00:00:30.20,00:00:31.64
We loved her acting.

00:00:31.80,00:00:35.83
We used to freeze-frame[br]a lot of her acting on the VCR...

00:00:36.01,00:00:40.21
...and play with ourselves.[br]We'd play "I'm Natasha Henstridge."

00:00:40.38,00:00:43.94
I'd close my eyes[br]and pretend Matt was Natasha...

00:00:44.12,00:00:47.35
...then Matt would pretend[br]I was Natasha.

00:00:47.52,00:00:52.39
But remember, if you play "I'm Natasha[br]Henstridge" with your friends...

00:00:52.56,00:00:54.53
...play it safe.

00:00:54.69,00:00:57.69
Look, it's our friend[br]Indian Companion.

00:00:57.86,00:01:00.46
Say hi to Indian Companion, kids.

00:01:00.63,00:01:04.07
What's happening, Indian Companion?[br]Someone coming?

00:01:04.24,00:01:07.43
- Someone coming.[br]- Someone coming. Great.

00:01:07.61,00:01:08.83
Thanks.

00:01:09.01,00:01:13.21
- Go build a tepee.[br]- You'll be Natasha Henstridge tonight.

00:01:13.38,00:01:17.37
So sit back, relax and have[br]a rootin'-tootin' good time...

00:01:17.55,00:01:21.32
...with "Tom's Rhinoplasty." Yee-haw!

00:01:21.49,00:01:23.28
Ready?

00:01:57.12,00:01:59.06
Tom's Rhinoplasty

00:02:01.46,00:02:05.33
- Stan, it's almost Valentine's Day.[br]- I know.

00:02:05.53,00:02:09.06
- We should go on a cruise.[br]- I can't afford a cruise.

00:02:09.27,00:02:15.33
We can make a little boat out of[br]cardboard and pretend it's a cruise.

00:02:18.74,00:02:21.18
Shut up, Cartman.

00:02:21.81,00:02:24.81
That is so lame!

00:02:30.29,00:02:34.92
Then we could dress up in costumes[br]and pretend we're getting married.

00:02:38.16,00:02:41.39
Stop this. You're killing me!

00:02:41.57,00:02:44.30
Children, I have[br]some difficult news.

00:02:44.50,00:02:50.81
Mr. Garrison won't be teaching[br]for a while. He has to have surgery.

00:02:50.98,00:02:54.91
So you're going to have[br]a substitute teacher.

00:02:55.11,00:03:00.92
I want you to show the substitute the[br]same respect you show Mr. Garrison.

00:03:01.12,00:03:05.11
- Yes, little boy?[br]- We don't respect Mr. Garrison.

00:03:05.89,00:03:10.73
Anyhoo, I want you all to meet[br]your new substitute, Miss Ellen.

00:03:10.93,00:03:13.56
Hello, children.

00:03:14.00,00:03:16.47
Wow, she's pretty.

00:03:17.64,00:03:20.04
You can say that again.

00:03:20.57,00:03:24.91
Good luck. If they get out of control,[br]just use this tear gas.

00:03:25.08,00:03:28.07
Thank you. I'm sure I'll be fine.

00:03:28.28,00:03:32.84
I know you must be very upset[br]about your teacher having surgery.

00:03:33.05,00:03:37.11
But I'll try to make things as easy[br]as possible for all of us.

00:03:37.29,00:03:39.66
Stan? Stan?

00:03:39.86,00:03:42.79
Now let me try and learn your names.

00:03:42.99,00:03:46.12
- You are Eric Cartman?[br]- Yes, ma'am!

00:03:46.33,00:03:49.70
Okay, and you must be Stan Marsh.

00:03:51.04,00:03:53.20
Do you need to go to the nurse?

00:03:53.41,00:03:57.17
- No, he pukes when he's in love.[br]- I'll kick your ass!

00:03:57.38,00:03:59.14
So you're all right?

00:04:00.38,00:04:02.35
You had waffles for breakfast.

00:04:05.88,00:04:09.05
I'm embarrassed about[br]getting a nose job, Tom.

00:04:09.25,00:04:12.05
I told the people at school[br]I had herpes.

00:04:12.39,00:04:16.22
Mr. Garrison, people have[br]cosmetic surgery all the time.

00:04:16.43,00:04:21.30
This computer can help you pick[br]what kind of nose you want.

00:04:21.50,00:04:25.60
- Isn't that amazing, Mr. Hat?[br]- It sure is, Mr. Garrison.

00:04:25.80,00:04:30.83
We could go with something smaller,[br]which would make you look like this:

00:04:31.78,00:04:35.80
Or we could straighten out the bridge,[br]like this:

00:04:36.01,00:04:39.14
- That's not bad.[br]- We could narrow the bridge...

00:04:39.32,00:04:42.48
...which would make you[br]look more like this:

00:04:43.46,00:04:47.59
- That's it, that's the nose I want![br]- Alrighty then.

00:04:47.76,00:04:50.85
Now, I must warn you, there are risks.

00:04:51.06,00:04:56.16
You could wind up a hideous creature,[br]forced to live in the sewers...

00:04:56.37,00:05:00.46
...only emerging at night[br]to hunt for scraps of food.

00:05:00.64,00:05:03.90
- I can live with that.[br]- Then let's get started.

00:05:05.94,00:05:11.18
- She was looking at me, not you.[br]- How could she help it, fat-ass?

00:05:11.38,00:05:15.05
- She was checking me out.[br]- Until you puked on her.

00:05:15.25,00:05:19.21
Hello, children.[br]What's all this about a new teacher?

00:05:19.42,00:05:23.69
- Miss Ellen. She's beautiful.[br]- Is she Vanessa Williams beautiful...

00:05:23.90,00:05:28.39
...or Toni Braxton beautiful?[br]Or Pamela Anderson beautiful?

00:05:28.60,00:05:32.26
Or is she Erin Gray of Buck Rogers[br]beautiful?

00:05:32.47,00:05:35.34
- Yeah, that one.[br]- I gotta meet this woman.

00:05:35.81,00:05:40.24
Didn't you notice how her left arm[br]is longer than the right one?

00:05:40.45,00:05:42.00
- No.[br]- Well, it is!

00:05:42.21,00:05:47.21
You know what they say about women[br]with one arm longer than the other.

00:05:47.79,00:05:48.95
Right.

00:05:49.12,00:05:52.85
Did you notice that mole on her neck[br]with hair growing out of it?

00:05:53.02,00:05:58.62
That's okay. You know what they say[br]about women with moles on their necks.

00:06:01.53,00:06:05.03
- We're still valentines, right?[br]- Sure, whatever.

00:06:05.20,00:06:09.07
- We should buy Miss Ellen presents.[br]- We'll go to the mall tonight.

00:06:09.24,00:06:14.58
I'm gonna buy her a vacuum cleaner.[br]Chicks love vacuum cleaners.

00:07:13.14,00:07:16.73
Goodness. Would anybody[br]mind cleaning my erasers?

00:07:16.94,00:07:18.10
Me, me, me!

00:07:18.28,00:07:20.84
You're so immature![br]Act like 8-year-olds.

00:07:21.01,00:07:24.57
- Stan, how about you?[br]- I'd love to.

00:07:24.75,00:07:28.05
Now, let's review[br]our multiplication tables.

00:07:28.72,00:07:31.52
- Cartman?[br]- What's a multiplication table?

00:07:31.72,00:07:35.52
Didn't Mr. Garrison[br]teach multiplication?

00:07:35.69,00:07:37.32
Where did he leave off?

00:07:37.53,00:07:42.73
We were learning about how Yasmine[br]Bleeth is dating Richard Grieco...

00:07:42.93,00:07:46.80
...that guy who used to be[br]on 2 1 Jump Street.

00:07:47.01,00:07:49.03
- Hello.[br]- Can I help you?

00:07:49.24,00:07:51.57
- I'm Chef.[br]- And...?

00:07:51.74,00:07:55.98
I stopped by because Kyle forgot[br]his detergent on the playground.

00:07:56.15,00:07:58.14
- My detergent?[br]- That's not...

00:07:58.35,00:08:01.29
Crazy cracker's always[br]leaving detergent.

00:08:01.49,00:08:04.89
- What was your name?[br]- Chef's moving in on Miss Ellen.

00:08:05.09,00:08:09.25
- I'm the substitute.[br]- Well, there's no substitute for you.

00:08:09.46,00:08:13.23
That's very nice, Mr. Chef.[br]Now, if you're finished...

00:08:50.20,00:08:51.90
We've got to learn that.

00:08:52.10,00:08:55.60
That was enthralling.[br]Could I get back to teaching?

00:08:55.81,00:09:00.30
- Lf we could have dinner tonight.[br]- Fine, just let me do my job.

00:09:00.51,00:09:03.95
- Chef's gonna make love to Miss Ellen![br]- What?

00:09:05.55,00:09:10.49
- Mr. Garrison? Mr. Garrison?[br]- Where am I?

00:09:10.69,00:09:15.68
- The operation is over, Mr. Garrison.[br]- I feel weak. How do I look?

00:09:15.89,00:09:19.80
- You look great.[br]- I feel kind of nauseous.

00:09:20.00,00:09:23.66
That's to be expected.[br]We did major reconstruction...

00:09:23.87,00:09:27.57
...sawed through some bone,[br]snapped some cartilage.

00:09:27.77,00:09:33.47
All the blood and mucus, the sound[br]of bone and sinew coming apart...

00:09:34.65,00:09:38.58
By the way, did you ever[br]see that movie Contact?

00:09:42.95,00:09:47.15
- Stop! That movie was terrible![br]- I'm sorry, Mr. Garrison.

00:09:47.33,00:09:51.66
Why don't you get some rest?[br]I'll check on you a little later.

00:09:52.80,00:09:57.26
I waited through that movie to see[br]the alien, and it was her father!

00:09:59.87,00:10:03.67
Remember your homework.[br]We have a lot of catching up.

00:10:03.88,00:10:06.84
- Goodbye, Miss Ellen.[br]- Stop kissing ass.

00:10:07.05,00:10:11.28
- I'm not kissing ass, you slut![br]- Miss Ellen, can I talk to you?

00:10:11.48,00:10:12.95
Of course, Wendy.

00:10:13.15,00:10:17.59
I couldn't help but notice you've[br]taken a liking to my boyfriend, Stan.

00:10:17.76,00:10:22.78
I've taken a liking to all of you.[br]You're all so cute and full of life.

00:10:22.99,00:10:27.76
- Can I tell you something, Miss Ellen?[br]- Of course, Wendy.

00:10:27.93,00:10:31.16
- Don't f* * * with me![br]- What?

00:10:31.37,00:10:34.00
Stay away from my man, bitch...

00:10:34.17,00:10:38.04
...or I'll whup your sorry ass[br]back to last year!

00:10:38.84,00:10:40.87
Bye, Miss Ellen!

00:10:43.58,00:10:48.58
I want to thank all you children[br]for the presents you bought me.

00:10:50.16,00:10:53.59
What a delightful scarf![br]Thank you, Kyle.

00:10:53.79,00:10:57.32
- Loser gift, loser gift.[br]- And here's one from Kenny.

00:10:57.80,00:11:03.73
Thank you very much, Kenny. This is[br]a very scrumptious-Iooking sausage.

00:11:05.00,00:11:09.46
And what a nice alarm clock![br]Thank you, Stan.

00:11:09.94,00:11:13.31
And here's another present,[br]from Wendy.

00:11:13.51,00:11:17.04
Why, it's a dead animal.[br]Thank you, Wendy.

00:11:18.08,00:11:21.42
- She liked mine the best.[br]- Where's yours, Cartman?

00:11:21.62,00:11:25.82
I got Miss Ellen a chocolate pie,[br]but I left it at home.

00:11:26.02,00:11:29.39
Okay, kids, we're gonna take[br]a spelling test now.

00:11:29.59,00:11:31.56
But as an extra incentive...

00:11:31.73,00:11:35.76
...I'm gonna take whoever gets[br]the highest score to dinner.

00:11:35.97,00:11:39.60
- I wish I knew how to spell.[br]- Are there any questions?

00:11:40.00,00:11:43.34
- Yes, Wendy?[br]- When someone gets as old as you...

00:11:43.51,00:11:47.14
...do they have to wear[br]Depend undergarments?

00:11:51.35,00:11:54.38
I aced that test.[br]I'm gonna win that dinner.

00:11:54.59,00:11:56.11
No, you're not.

00:11:56.39,00:11:58.69
- Hi, Stan.[br]- I bet I scored 1 00.

00:11:58.89,00:12:01.19
- Hi, Stan![br]- Oh, hi, Wendy.

00:12:01.39,00:12:06.73
Miss Ellen was just in the bathroom[br]taking the biggest dump I've ever seen.

00:12:06.93,00:12:08.73
- No, she wasn't.[br]- She was!

00:12:08.93,00:12:12.60
- That's impossible.[br]- And she has horrible gas too.

00:12:12.80,00:12:15.36
She says she can't control it.

00:12:15.57,00:12:19.34
It smelled like a dead calf[br]rotting in the hot sun.

00:12:19.54,00:12:22.91
Wendy, you need to stop[br]with this jealousy thing.

00:12:23.11,00:12:28.52
- Yeah, you're acting like a freak.[br]- No, I'm not acting like a freak!

00:12:33.63,00:12:36.56
Someone's gotta pull that monkey[br]out of her ass.

00:12:36.73,00:12:38.46
- Hello there.[br]- Hey, Chef.

00:12:38.66,00:12:41.19
- How did your date go?[br]- Not too good.

00:12:41.40,00:12:45.86
- Didn't you make sweet love to her?[br]- No, she's not like that.

00:12:46.07,00:12:48.47
How do I put this?

00:12:48.67,00:12:52.54
Miss Ellen doesn't exactly play[br]for the right team.

00:12:53.28,00:12:55.11
In other words, children...

00:12:55.61,00:13:00.74
...she's not a member[br]of the heterosexual persuasion.

00:13:00.92,00:13:03.89
- Understand? She's a lesbian.[br]- A what-bian?

00:13:04.09,00:13:07.65
- A plebeian?[br]- You don't know what a lesbian is?

00:13:07.86,00:13:09.62
Kenny?

00:13:10.13,00:13:12.96
- No, explain it to us, Chef.[br]- That's okay.

00:13:13.13,00:13:16.19
All you need to know[br]is Miss Ellen's a lesbian...

00:13:16.37,00:13:19.20
...and she only likes other lesbians.

00:13:19.40,00:13:21.37
Now move along, children.

00:13:21.57,00:13:23.90
Weak! She only likes lesbians?

00:13:24.11,00:13:28.64
If she only likes other lesbians,[br]then we gotta become lesbians too.

00:13:28.81,00:13:32.27
My grandma was Dutch-Irish[br]and my grandpa was lesbian.

00:13:32.45,00:13:35.39
- I'm a quarter lesbian.[br]- You're just saying that.

00:13:35.55,00:13:37.68
- You're not a lesbian.[br]- I am too!

00:13:38.52,00:13:41.89
- Okay, only a few more bandages to go.[br]- Well?

00:13:42.36,00:13:45.12
Take a look for yourself.

00:13:46.06,00:13:50.23
Wow, that's a pretty good nose job.[br]What do you think, Mr. Hat?

00:13:50.44,00:13:52.03
I think it looks great.

00:13:52.24,00:13:55.36
And without the swelling,[br]you'll really notice.

00:13:59.88,00:14:04.61
- What the hell are you doing?[br]- My mom said lesbians lick carpet.

00:14:04.82,00:14:07.15
- Really?[br]- I got an Indiglo Girls CD.

00:14:07.35,00:14:12.31
- The record store guy said to get it.[br]- I got these killer Birkenstocks.

00:14:16.73,00:14:21.06
I've been licking carpet for 3 hours,[br]and I don't feel like a lesbian!

00:14:32.51,00:14:37.11
- Hi, Mrs. Kimball.[br]- Howdy, Mr. Garrison.

00:14:37.32,00:14:40.08
Say, honey, you look[br]kind of different.

00:14:40.28,00:14:43.25
- Really?[br]- Did you get a haircut?

00:14:43.45,00:14:46.62
No, but thanks for asking.

00:14:47.13,00:14:49.69
Call me. I'm in the book.

00:14:49.89,00:14:52.92
Having a nose job is better[br]than I thought.

00:14:53.13,00:14:56.03
A whole world of opportunity[br]is opening up.

00:14:57.44,00:14:59.84
- Thanks for coming.[br]- That's okay.

00:15:00.04,00:15:03.17
I brought my makeup kit.[br]What are we doing?

00:15:03.37,00:15:07.50
That substitute won't stop[br]until she takes everything from me.

00:15:07.71,00:15:09.84
- Really?[br]- What I'd like to do...

00:15:10.05,00:15:14.71
...is load her into a rocket[br]and have her shot into the sun.

00:15:14.89,00:15:17.45
Instead, I'll just get Stan[br]to notice me.

00:15:17.66,00:15:20.22
- Bebe, I need a makeover.[br]- Cool.

00:15:22.56,00:15:25.19
Wait until she sees[br]what a lesbian I am.

00:15:25.40,00:15:28.59
- I'm a bigger lesbian.[br]- You're a fatter lesbian.

00:15:28.80,00:15:33.93
- Screw you guys, I'm king lesbian.[br]- Is that Wendy Testaburger?

00:15:39.21,00:15:40.47
Hi, what's up?

00:15:40.68,00:15:44.27
Wendy looks like that chick[br]from Grease, Elton John.

00:15:44.48,00:15:47.54
- Wow. Hi, Wendy.[br]- Hi, Stan.

00:15:48.09,00:15:50.35
- I think it worked, Bebe.[br]- Yeah.

00:15:50.56,00:15:54.58
- Good morning, children.[br]- Wow!

00:15:58.16,00:16:01.76
Wendy, you wore black leather too.

00:16:01.97,00:16:05.09
- We're like sisters.[br]- Die!

00:16:05.27,00:16:07.20
I finished grading your papers.

00:16:07.37,00:16:11.71
- The person with the highest score is...[br]- Hello there, children.

00:16:16.65,00:16:19.34
- Oh, no, Mr. Garrison's back.[br]- Weak!

00:16:19.55,00:16:25.32
Hooray! Hooray for Mr. Garrison![br]He's back. Mr. Garrison is back!

00:16:25.52,00:16:29.43
So long, don't let the door[br]hit your ass on the way out.

00:16:29.63,00:16:35.62
I have a very important announcement.[br]I'm quitting my job as a teacher.

00:16:36.13,00:16:39.86
- What?[br]- Suddenly I feel really confident.

00:16:40.07,00:16:43.73
I've decided to quit and do[br]what I've always dreamed of:

00:16:43.94,00:16:47.81
- Hang out and screw hot chicks.[br]- You can't.

00:16:48.01,00:16:51.54
The good new is,[br]I've talked to Principal Victoria...

00:16:51.75,00:16:55.98
...and Miss Ellen can stay on[br]as your permanent teacher.

00:16:57.12,00:17:00.25
- Really?[br]- That's right. Will you stay?

00:17:00.46,00:17:04.52
- Well, sure.[br]- No! No!

00:17:04.73,00:17:08.32
And the person who scored highest[br]on the quiz...

00:17:08.53,00:17:12.20
...and gets to have dinner on me[br]is Stan.

00:17:12.40,00:17:15.43
- Kick-ass.[br]- No! No!

00:17:15.64,00:17:21.37
Wendy, we just got a call[br]in the office. Your grandma just died.

00:17:22.35,00:17:24.21
My, what an exciting day.

00:17:30.05,00:17:33.85
- You're looking great.[br]- I'm a lady-killer, Mr. Hat.

00:17:34.06,00:17:39.59
- You can say that again, Mr. Garrison.[br]- Just a few hundred more shots.

00:17:39.80,00:17:43.10
- A few hundred?[br]- That's the life of a model, baby.

00:17:43.30,00:17:47.74
- I'm gonna need some more smack.[br]- You got it!

00:17:51.44,00:17:57.51
I'm very glad we could have dinner.[br]I really care about your education.

00:17:57.68,00:18:00.08
- Are we making love now?[br]- Excuse me?

00:18:00.25,00:18:03.85
There's no fireplace.[br]We shouldn't be making love yet.

00:18:04.02,00:18:06.35
Chef says you have[br]to make love by the fire.

00:18:06.52,00:18:10.05
I'm your teacher. We're only friends.

00:18:10.26,00:18:13.03
- But why?[br]- First of all, you're 8.

00:18:13.23,00:18:16.10
- It's because I'm not a lesbian.[br]- Oh, boy.

00:18:19.17,00:18:22.90
It's over. I give up.

00:18:27.68,00:18:33.05
Boy, Mr. Hat, being hot and sexy is fun[br]for a while, but it does get boring.

00:18:33.22,00:18:36.31
You can say that again, Mr. Garrison.

00:18:36.49,00:18:38.46
What the...?

00:18:38.96,00:18:41.79
Whoa! Hey, wait, wait!

00:18:42.79,00:18:44.73
Mr. Hat, save yourself!

00:18:46.36,00:18:48.49
- How'd it go?[br]- Did you make love?

00:18:48.70,00:18:50.69
- I think so.[br]- No way!

00:18:50.90,00:18:52.27
Down by the fire?

00:18:54.71,00:18:57.57
- Did I what?[br]- Good morning, children.

00:18:57.78,00:19:02.54
- Miss Ellen, can I talk to you?[br]- Can it wait till after class?

00:19:02.75,00:19:06.41
No, I have to apologize[br]for the way I've been acting.

00:19:06.62,00:19:09.31
- That's okay, Wendy.[br]- No, it's not.

00:19:09.52,00:19:12.61
Since you're staying,[br]I hope we can be friends.

00:19:12.82,00:19:18.96
- Well, I would love that, Wendy.[br]- And I want to apologize to everybody.

00:19:19.13,00:19:22.79
The way I acted was wrong,[br]and I've learned from it.

00:19:23.00,00:19:28.13
I just wish Stan and Miss Ellen[br]all the happiness in the world.

00:19:28.41,00:19:33.97
- There's nothing between me and Stan.[br]- That's not what we just heard.

00:19:35.51,00:19:41.21
Mr. Hat, I hate this.[br]I wish I'd never had a nose job.

00:19:41.89,00:19:46.41
Damn this beautiful face of mine.[br]Damn it to hell!

00:19:46.62,00:19:51.89
We have to get the surgery again,[br]Mr. Hat. I wanna be the old me again.

00:19:55.33,00:19:59.13
Okay, let's catch up[br]on our cursive handwriting.

00:19:59.34,00:20:02.93
- Down! Down! Everybody down![br]- What the hell?

00:20:04.01,00:20:08.07
- So we meet again, Miss Ellen.[br]- Just what is going on here?

00:20:08.28,00:20:11.25
I am Hakeem Kurashki[br]of the nation of Iraq.

00:20:11.45,00:20:13.68
- She is a traitor.[br]- It's a lie!

00:20:13.85,00:20:16.79
She has killed thousands[br]and will kill again.

00:20:16.95,00:20:19.65
- Miss Ellen, is this true?[br]- No!

00:20:19.82,00:20:21.69
We must take her back to Iraq!

00:20:21.86,00:20:24.95
- Cool![br]- Principal Victoria, please.

00:20:25.16,00:20:30.12
Here is Miss Ellen and our leader.[br]Her name is Makesh Alaq Makarakesh.

00:20:30.50,00:20:35.00
Well, you certainly tried to put one[br]over on us, boy howdy.

00:20:35.21,00:20:40.11
- Take her away![br]- No, get away from me!

00:20:44.42,00:20:48.68
- Oh, my God, she killed Kenny![br]- You bastard!

00:20:49.99,00:20:52.32
Wow, what incredible irony.

00:20:54.02,00:20:56.86
I can't believe she was[br]a criminal Iraqi fugitive.

00:20:57.06,00:21:01.76
- Yeah, you just never know.[br]- I guess I'm sorry I was ignoring you.

00:21:01.97,00:21:05.93
Happy Valentine's Day, Stan.

00:21:10.94,00:21:13.60
- Sorry.[br]- No, it's okay, Stan.

00:21:13.81,00:21:18.18
- Everything's okay.[br]- Are you still trying to be a lesbian?

00:21:18.38,00:21:21.94
My mom says all I have to do[br]is chow on this box.

00:21:27.46,00:21:32.23
For crimes against this country,[br]you are to be shot into the sun.

00:21:32.40,00:21:37.03
This is all a mistake.[br]This can't be happening.

00:21:38.20,00:21:43.37
- Please, for the love of God![br]- Shut up!

00:21:48.58,00:21:50.24
Great party, Wendy.

00:21:50.41,00:21:54.71
Thanks, Mrs. Kimball.[br]Thanks for getting Mr. Garrison back.

00:21:54.92,00:21:58.12
- Anything for you, sugar pie.[br]- Hi, Kyle.

00:21:58.32,00:22:02.28
- This whole outcome is pretty strange.[br]- Excuse me.

00:22:11.87,00:22:14.84
How was Miss Ellen[br]suddenly arrested for...?

00:22:15.04,00:22:18.67
It's time to whip out[br]the eclipse shoeboxes!

00:22:23.41,00:22:27.25
- Bye-bye, Miss Ellen.[br]- Wendy, you didn't!

00:22:27.45,00:22:29.42
I told her...

00:22:29.62,00:22:35.25
...don't f* * * with Wendy Testaburger!
