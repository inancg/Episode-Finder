00:00:03.34,00:00:06.57
- Howdy-ho, all you South Parketeers.[br]- Howdy-ho!

00:00:06.75,00:00:09.84
- I'm Rootin'-Tootin' Trey Parker.[br]- I'm Pistol-Slinging Matt Stone.

00:00:10.02,00:00:14.18
- This is Scratch. Say hi, old fella.[br]- Hi, Scratch!

00:00:14.39,00:00:19.29
Matt and I are excited because[br]this episode is our favorite.

00:00:19.49,00:00:23.89
It's our Christmas special entitled[br]"Mr. Hankey, The Christmas Poo."

00:00:24.06,00:00:28.23
Kyle, the little Jewish kid,[br]is visited by a talking candy bar.

00:00:28.40,00:00:31.37
The reason this episode[br]is our favorite is...

00:00:31.57,00:00:35.53
...because it introduces[br]the school counselor, Mr. Mackey.

00:00:35.74,00:00:39.04
He was based on a counselor[br]I had in junior high.

00:00:39.24,00:00:42.98
I used to run around,[br]getting in trouble, and he'd say:

00:00:43.18,00:00:46.01
"Trey, get back to your[br]schoolwork, m'kay?"

00:00:46.18,00:00:48.58
Now I'm making millions off him.

00:00:48.75,00:00:52.12
Like all of our episodes,[br]this one has a moral lesson:

00:00:52.29,00:00:56.89
Everyone, regardless of your religion,[br]should celebrate Christmas...

00:00:57.06,00:00:59.29
...because it's the best holiday.

00:01:00.83,00:01:04.32
It's our Indian companion friend[br]Indian Companion.

00:01:04.54,00:01:07.51
- Hello, Indian Companion.[br]- Say hi, kids.

00:01:08.14,00:01:09.90
Someone coming.

00:01:11.61,00:01:13.10
Thank you.

00:01:15.25,00:01:19.45
Anyway, sit back, relax and have[br]a rootin'-tootin' good time...

00:01:19.65,00:01:22.95
...with Mr. Hankey,[br]the Christmas chocolate bar.

00:01:24.66,00:01:26.12
Hooray!

00:01:37.97,00:01:39.87
Mr. Hankey, The Christmas Poo

00:01:43.74,00:01:45.64
Lights, please.

00:01:45.84,00:01:50.61
There were shepherds abiding in[br]the field, watching over their flock.

00:01:50.82,00:01:55.28
The Lord's angel came upon them,[br]and they were afraid. He said:

00:01:55.45,00:02:00.45
"Fear not. I bring tidings of joy.[br]For born today in the city of David...

00:02:00.66,00:02:04.93
...is the savior, Jesus Christ. Glory[br]to God and good will towards men."

00:02:05.13,00:02:08.73
And now, South Park Elementary[br]presents The Birth of Jesus.

00:02:12.77,00:02:14.50
Come on, Mary, push!

00:02:14.91,00:02:16.60
I can see its head!

00:02:18.34,00:02:19.47
It's a boy!

00:02:22.15,00:02:23.84
Wait a minute. Wait.

00:02:24.05,00:02:27.99
Kyle, you need to hold the baby[br]by the legs not the head.

00:02:28.15,00:02:30.18
- What kind of sick weirdo are you?[br]- Sorry.

00:02:30.36,00:02:33.85
And Wendy, I'm still not believing[br]the labor pains.

00:02:34.06,00:02:37.93
Mr. Garrison, what the hell[br]do you think you're doing?

00:02:38.13,00:02:40.50
I'm trying to direct the school[br]Christmas play...

00:02:40.70,00:02:43.86
...but your son was holding[br]baby Jesus fetus by the head.

00:02:44.07,00:02:49.47
How dare you include the Nativity[br]in a school play! My son is Jewish!

00:02:50.48,00:02:51.46
So?

00:02:51.68,00:02:55.37
So what makes you think[br]he should play Joseph?

00:02:55.61,00:03:00.07
- Because it's Christmas.[br]- Our family doesn't celebrate Christmas!

00:03:01.52,00:03:04.15
You're not gonna lay[br]that Channukah crap on me, are you?

00:03:04.36,00:03:07.38
What? You won't get away with this!

00:03:07.59,00:03:11.32
- Kyle's mom's here to ruin Christmas.[br]- Shut up, fat boy!

00:03:11.53,00:03:15.23
- I'm not fat. I'm festively plump.[br]- Why are you Jewish on Christmas?

00:03:15.43,00:03:20.60
Kyle, is there anything you can do for[br]the play that isn't Jesus-related?

00:03:20.81,00:03:23.54
How about the dreidel song, bubee?

00:03:23.74,00:03:27.54
- I can sing "The Mr. Hankey Song."[br]- How does that go?

00:03:31.22,00:03:33.68
- "Christmas poo"?[br]- What's "Christmas poo"?

00:03:33.89,00:03:36.35
Mr. Hankey the Christmas Poo.[br]Haven't you heard of it?

00:03:36.56,00:03:38.08
Kyle, that is enough!

00:03:38.29,00:03:40.88
That's what you get[br]for raising a pagan.

00:03:41.09,00:03:44.89
That does it! I'm going straight[br]to the mayor about you!

00:03:45.10,00:03:47.90
Wait, I'm sorry.[br]Was it the pagan remark?

00:03:48.10,00:03:49.57
You guys, look.

00:03:49.77,00:03:51.67
It's snowing.

00:03:55.77,00:03:59.27
- Christmas snow.[br]- Try to catch flakes on your tongue.

00:04:00.31,00:04:01.90
It's fun.

00:04:08.62,00:04:09.75
Sick, dude.

00:04:10.32,00:04:13.55
Hey! Jewish people[br]can't eat Christmas snow.

00:04:13.76,00:04:16.19
- We can too.[br]- It's against the law.

00:04:16.39,00:04:18.33
- Officer Barbrady?[br]- What?

00:04:18.53,00:04:21.69
Is it illegal for Jews to eat[br]Christmas snow?

00:04:22.00,00:04:23.66
- Yes.[br]- Damn it!

00:04:23.87,00:04:27.00
We have to go tell Santa Claus[br]what we want.

00:04:27.21,00:04:30.17
Bye, Kyle.[br]There's no reason for you to come...

00:04:30.38,00:04:34.18
...since you don't get Christmas gifts.[br]- I get Channukah gifts for eight days.

00:04:34.38,00:04:36.85
Too bad it's usually[br]a dreidel or something lame.

00:04:37.05,00:04:39.02
We'll catch you later, Kyle.

00:04:39.22,00:04:42.78
Wait! I may not have Santa, but I do[br]have Mr. Hankey the Christmas Poo.

00:04:42.99,00:04:45.96
- What's this about Christmas poo?[br]- Mr. Hankey.

00:04:46.16,00:04:49.59
He comes out of the toilet and gives[br]gifts to people with high-fiber diets.

00:04:49.80,00:04:52.49
You are really reaching right now.

00:04:52.70,00:04:56.63
You'll be sorry when I ride[br]on Santa's sleigh with Mr. Hankey.

00:04:56.84,00:04:59.70
You won't ride on Santa's sleigh,[br]because you're a Jew.

00:04:59.91,00:05:01.43
See ya, dude.

00:06:40.41,00:06:43.17
Okay, everybody, settle down.

00:06:43.38,00:06:48.61
We are deeply offended by the Nativity[br]scene in front of the capital office.

00:06:48.81,00:06:50.87
Church and state are separate.

00:06:52.28,00:06:55.72
- What's going on?[br]- The whole town's pissed off.

00:06:55.92,00:06:59.98
That isn't all, mayor. The school play[br]is doing a Nativity scene.

00:07:00.19,00:07:03.35
It isn't being sensitive[br]to the Jewish community.

00:07:03.56,00:07:06.09
You are the Jewish community.

00:07:06.30,00:07:09.83
- Super-bitch is at it again.[br]- Don't call my mom a bitch.

00:07:10.04,00:07:14.17
The Nativity is what Christmas is about.[br]If you remove Christ...

00:07:14.37,00:07:17.60
...you must remove Santa,[br]Frosty and all that garbage too.

00:07:18.58,00:07:21.77
And we must stop[br]cutting down Christmas trees.

00:07:23.58,00:07:26.35
I'm sick of those flaps on coffee lids.

00:07:26.55,00:07:30.58
If you don't want to spill coffee,[br]don't drive with it.

00:07:33.33,00:07:37.13
Okay, people. Clearly, we need[br]to reach a compromise.

00:07:37.33,00:07:40.89
Perhaps we need[br]a new icon for Christmas.

00:07:41.10,00:07:42.36
Brilliant idea.

00:07:43.80,00:07:46.90
Hey, how about[br]Mr. Hankey the Christmas Poo?

00:07:47.11,00:07:49.67
- Excuse me?[br]- Oh, boy. Here we go again.

00:07:49.84,00:07:51.78
He comes out of the toilet...

00:07:51.98,00:07:54.71
...and gives gifts to everybody[br]who eats fiber.

00:07:54.91,00:07:55.90
Kyle!

00:07:56.11,00:07:59.28
It's true. He doesn't care[br]what faith you are.

00:08:03.52,00:08:06.82
Don't mind him.[br]He's a very disturbed little boy.

00:08:07.53,00:08:10.12
- Kyle, we're leaving right now.[br]- Wait.

00:08:10.33,00:08:14.46
Anyway, I'll put together[br]a crack team of my best workers...

00:08:14.67,00:08:17.46
...so this will be a[br]non-offensive Christmas...

00:08:17.67,00:08:21.73
...to any religious or minority group.[br]Any other suggestions?

00:08:22.67,00:08:26.77
- Yes, Mr. Garrison?[br]- Could we get rid of all the Mexicans?

00:08:28.81,00:08:32.81
No, Mr. Garrison, we cannot[br]get rid of all the Mexicans.

00:08:33.02,00:08:34.54
Rats.

00:08:40.36,00:08:43.12
It's disgusting,[br]and we will not have it.

00:08:43.33,00:08:45.99
- Your father's right, Kyle.[br]- Let me handle this.

00:08:46.20,00:08:49.76
Having imaginary friends is fine,[br]but this won't do!

00:08:49.97,00:08:51.56
Listen to your father.

00:08:51.77,00:08:56.40
I want you to repeat after me,[br]"There is no such thing as Mr. Hankey."

00:08:56.61,00:08:58.04
- But, Dad, he...[br]- Say it!

00:08:58.58,00:09:00.94
- There is no such thing as Mr. Hankey.[br]- Again.

00:09:01.15,00:09:04.38
- There is no such thing as Mr. Hankey.[br]- It's for your own good.

00:09:04.58,00:09:09.28
Now go to bed. You won't be[br]opening your Channukah gift tonight.

00:09:09.49,00:09:12.55
- Probably a stupid dreidel, anyway.[br]- What did you say?

00:09:12.76,00:09:14.42
I said, Ike's on fire.

00:09:14.96,00:09:16.15
Oh, my God!

00:09:19.30,00:09:22.63
It isn't fair.[br]I don't wanna be an outcast.

00:09:23.94,00:09:26.43
- I'm not hearing that.[br]- Hello?

00:09:28.01,00:09:29.00
Mr. Hankey?

00:09:30.38,00:09:32.40
Howdy-ho!

00:09:33.91,00:09:35.40
Howdy-ho, Kyle.

00:09:35.61,00:09:38.58
- Gosh, you're looking swell.[br]- Go away.

00:09:38.78,00:09:43.05
You know something, pal?[br]You smell an awful lot like flowers.

00:09:43.25,00:09:46.09
- My dad says you aren't real.[br]- Not real?

00:09:46.29,00:09:51.49
Well, shucks, if I weren't real, could[br]I sing this jolly Christmas song?

00:09:59.20,00:10:01.07
I'll get in trouble.

00:10:08.81,00:10:10.97
- What are you doing?[br]- Nothing.

00:10:11.18,00:10:12.31
Open the door!

00:10:14.42,00:10:16.11
Mr. Hankey, come here.

00:10:21.69,00:10:23.68
Say something, Mr. Hankey.

00:10:26.63,00:10:31.07
Get to sleep and think about how[br]your mother has to clean that bathroom.

00:10:31.27,00:10:32.67
What? Me?

00:10:35.77,00:10:39.17
- Howdy-ho![br]- Mr. Hankey, where the hell did you go?

00:10:39.38,00:10:43.47
You should be wearing socks to sleep.[br]You'll catch a cold.

00:10:43.68,00:10:46.65
Nobody believes in you,[br]not even my friends.

00:10:46.85,00:10:47.91
That's too bad.

00:10:48.12,00:10:51.68
Come to school with me[br]so I can prove I'm not crazy.

00:10:51.89,00:10:54.72
Say, that sounds like a swell idea.

00:10:54.93,00:10:57.95
We can show everyone[br]the spirit of Christmas.

00:10:58.16,00:11:00.36
Yeah, we'll show them.

00:11:00.93,00:11:05.39
We've got to turn this place around.[br]Take down anything that's offensive...

00:11:05.60,00:11:07.47
...to any specific group.

00:11:07.67,00:11:10.14
Is mistletoe offensive?

00:11:10.34,00:11:12.87
Is anyone offended by mistletoe?

00:11:14.48,00:11:16.54
Lose the mistletoe.

00:11:18.25,00:11:21.55
I'm getting that John Elway[br]helmet for Christmas.

00:11:21.75,00:11:24.69
- How do you know?[br]- It's in my parents' closet.

00:11:24.89,00:11:28.79
I sneaked around my mom's closet[br]and saw what I'm getting:

00:11:28.99,00:11:32.12
- The Ultra Vibe Pleasure 2000.[br]- What's that?

00:11:32.33,00:11:35.93
- I don't know, but it sounds sweet.[br]- Hello, everybody.

00:11:36.13,00:11:38.19
- What's in the box?[br]- A surprise.

00:11:38.40,00:11:40.80
- Let me see.[br]- Okay. Don't scare him.

00:11:45.38,00:11:46.60
Dude, sick!

00:11:48.48,00:11:51.18
Is this some kind of Jewish tradition?

00:11:52.72,00:11:54.95
Wait, you guys, he's alive.

00:11:55.35,00:11:59.05
- You better go home and get some sleep.[br]- Dance!

00:11:59.39,00:12:01.69
Dance! Dance, damn you!

00:12:02.39,00:12:06.02
I'm going to say words,[br]and the computer will measure...

00:12:06.23,00:12:10.96
...how offended you are. We can find out[br]which words are least offensive...

00:12:11.17,00:12:13.76
...for use in the holiday season.[br]Ready?

00:12:13.97,00:12:15.06
Here we go.

00:12:15.27,00:12:16.97
Christ.

00:12:17.74,00:12:19.57
Okay. Chair.

00:12:21.65,00:12:22.64
Camel.

00:12:25.45,00:12:26.47
Sand.

00:12:28.89,00:12:30.38
Stupid wop-dago.

00:12:33.39,00:12:34.38
Bench.

00:12:37.33,00:12:40.99
- Do you have to take the tree too?[br]- Mayor's orders.

00:12:41.93,00:12:45.93
Okay, I'm having a hard time[br]with our Christmas play.

00:12:46.14,00:12:50.27
We can't sing songs having to do[br]with Jesus or Santa Claus.

00:12:50.48,00:12:52.34
- Thanks to Kyle's mom.[br]- Shut up!

00:12:52.54,00:12:56.34
Anybody know any non-Santa[br]or non-Jesus Christmas songs?

00:12:57.28,00:12:58.94
- Yes, Eric?[br]- How about we sing:

00:12:59.15,00:13:04.68
- "Kyle's Mom is a Stupid Bitch" in D?[br]- I said not to call my mom a bitch!

00:13:13.73,00:13:15.10
Shut up, Cartman!

00:13:16.00,00:13:18.73
- Howdy-ho![br]- Mr. Hankey.

00:13:26.71,00:13:31.17
Golly, that isn't very nice.[br]I'd sure like to teach him a lesson.

00:13:52.74,00:13:54.07
Mr. Hankey, no.

00:13:54.97,00:13:57.67
- What the...?[br]- Gross, Kyle!

00:13:57.88,00:14:01.07
Kyle, did you just throw[br]doo-doo at Eric?

00:14:02.68,00:14:04.67
You sick bastard!

00:14:06.02,00:14:08.82
Now, Kyle, as your school counselor...

00:14:09.02,00:14:12.35
...I want to help you[br]confront your problem, m'kay?

00:14:12.52,00:14:15.22
- I don't have a problem.[br]- It's my understanding...

00:14:15.39,00:14:18.99
...that you have an acute case[br]of fecalphilia.

00:14:19.16,00:14:20.26
What's that?

00:14:20.47,00:14:24.60
A fecalphiliac is somebody who's[br]obsessed with mookie-stinks, Kyle.

00:14:25.80,00:14:29.97
- I also understand that you're Jewish.[br]- Well, not on purpose.

00:14:30.17,00:14:33.47
This must be a pretty hard time[br]of year for you.

00:14:33.68,00:14:36.37
- Do kids make fun of you?[br]- Sometimes.

00:14:36.58,00:14:38.45
- That must make you mad.[br]- Sure.

00:14:38.65,00:14:41.48
Mad enough to kill, Kyle?

00:14:41.99,00:14:43.61
- No, dude![br]- That's good.

00:14:43.82,00:14:49.76
Sometimes we feel like an outsider.[br]We create friends in our minds, m'kay?

00:14:49.96,00:14:51.66
Mr. Hankey seems so real.

00:14:51.83,00:14:56.99
Of course he does. In your screwed up[br]head, he's the only friend you have.

00:14:57.20,00:14:58.19
Kyle!

00:14:58.40,00:15:00.10
Howdy-ho!

00:15:01.34,00:15:04.64
You're nuttier than[br]Chinese chicken salad, m'kay?

00:15:04.84,00:15:08.18
You're one screwed-up little kid.[br]You understand?

00:15:11.68,00:15:16.64
Try and stay positive. Stay away from[br]drugs and alcohol. In the meantime...

00:15:16.85,00:15:19.55
...I'm putting you on a[br]heavy regimen of Prozac.

00:15:21.96,00:15:24.76
Oh, my God, you sick little monkey!

00:15:24.96,00:15:28.09
Children, we've just[br]received word from the mayor...

00:15:28.30,00:15:31.67
...that the play can't include[br]any Christmas lights...

00:15:31.87,00:15:34.93
...since they offend people[br]with epilepsy.

00:15:35.14,00:15:39.44
Kenny, please go over and pull[br]the light cords out of the wall.

00:15:41.88,00:15:45.75
Careful now, Kenny.[br]Those are very, very dangerous.

00:15:50.96,00:15:54.08
- Now let's practice our...[br]- No! Get away from me.

00:15:54.29,00:15:57.19
- Just look more closely at it.[br]- No! Go away!

00:15:57.40,00:16:00.83
Stan, you need to do something[br]about your friend.

00:16:01.03,00:16:04.26
Get him out of here before[br]he hurts anybody.

00:16:06.47,00:16:08.91
We need to commit our friend Kyle.

00:16:09.11,00:16:12.08
- Reason?[br]- I'm a clinically-depressed fecalphiliac.

00:16:12.28,00:16:14.01
- Any allergies?[br]- No.

00:16:14.21,00:16:15.51
Jacket!

00:16:17.92,00:16:20.28
Bye, Kyle. Happy Channukah.

00:16:23.29,00:16:27.05
Okay, children, does everyone[br]have their leotards on?

00:16:28.53,00:16:31.26
Good. It looks like they've taken[br]the trees down.

00:16:31.46,00:16:35.13
There's nothing Christian either.[br]This should be great.

00:16:35.33,00:16:40.20
This could be such a wonderful play.[br]I wish Kyle was here to see it.

00:16:45.54,00:16:47.77
Second verse, same as the first.

00:16:48.75,00:16:53.12
- Welcome to the South Park...[br]- Wait. There's a star above the stage.

00:16:53.32,00:16:57.08
- That's offensive to non-Christians.[br]- Oh, come on.

00:16:57.29,00:17:00.38
- Hey! Don't push your beliefs on me.[br]- I agree.

00:17:00.59,00:17:01.89
Oh, brother.

00:17:02.09,00:17:06.39
Kenny, climb the ladder and take down[br]the star above the stage.

00:17:06.60,00:17:09.50
Be careful not to fall[br]in the pool below you.

00:17:09.70,00:17:12.43
The shark for the third act[br]is in there.

00:17:13.30,00:17:17.40
Welcome to the South Park Elementary[br]Holiday Experience.

00:17:17.61,00:17:20.48
Before we start,[br]here's a non-offensive...

00:17:20.68,00:17:23.77
...non-denominational song[br]by the school chef.

00:17:50.51,00:17:52.77
Doesn't seem right without Kyle.

00:17:52.98,00:17:56.31
Well, old Kyle's gonna be[br]locked up for a while. Get used to it.

00:17:56.51,00:18:00.08
- Get ready to take your places.[br]- Thank you, Chef.

00:18:03.85,00:18:06.45
Now, South Park Elementary presents...

00:18:06.66,00:18:10.29
...the non-offensive,[br]non-denominational Christmas play...

00:18:10.49,00:18:15.06
...with music and lyrics by New York[br]minimalist composer, Philip Glass.

00:18:18.00,00:18:21.03
As I turn and look into the sun...

00:18:21.24,00:18:23.80
...the rays burn my eyes.

00:18:26.14,00:18:28.81
How like a turtle, the sun looks.

00:18:29.01,00:18:30.74
What the hell is this?

00:18:32.92,00:18:34.15
This is horrible.

00:18:34.35,00:18:37.19
This is the most God-awful[br]piece of crap I've ever seen.

00:18:37.39,00:18:39.22
You made it this way.

00:18:39.42,00:18:43.86
- The Jews didn't want it Christian.[br]- We didn't take out Santa.

00:18:44.06,00:18:46.53
All you bastards ruined Christmas.

00:18:46.73,00:18:49.13
- Get him in the ribs.[br]- Tree-hugger!

00:18:49.50,00:18:53.44
- This is the worst Christmas ever.[br]- Yeah.

00:18:55.17,00:18:56.40
Where's Kyle?

00:18:56.57,00:18:58.51
- We committed him.[br]- What? Why?

00:18:58.71,00:19:02.98
He kept seeing this brown piece[br]of Christmas poo everywhere.

00:19:03.15,00:19:05.95
Christmas Poo? You mean Mr. Hankey.

00:19:09.62,00:19:12.75
- Say, kids, why the long faces?[br]- We're bored.

00:19:12.96,00:19:16.45
- There's nothing to do.[br]- Maybe this will help.

00:19:16.63,00:19:19.06
A Mr. Hankey Construction Set!

00:19:19.46,00:19:24.13
Now you can make your own Mr. Hankey.[br]Just use the fecal fishing net...

00:19:24.34,00:19:27.13
...and select your best Mr. Hankey.[br]- That one.

00:19:27.34,00:19:31.30
Then use the Hankey stand[br]to add eyes, mouth and hats.

00:19:31.51,00:19:34.17
I made a mariachi Mr. Hankey.

00:19:34.38,00:19:36.24
Now it's a Mrs. Hankey.

00:19:36.41,00:19:40.41
- Let's put the fez hat on him.[br]- I wish Daddy were still alive.

00:19:41.42,00:19:44.35
The set comes with everything[br]seen here.

00:19:44.52,00:19:46.05
Where's Mr. Hankey?

00:19:51.06,00:19:53.79
- I love you, sweetheart.[br]- I love you too.

00:19:57.74,00:20:02.76
This is horrible. All of this because[br]we didn't believe in Mr. Hankey.

00:20:02.97,00:20:05.24
You can believe in him now.

00:20:06.41,00:20:07.71
I believe.

00:20:07.91,00:20:09.85
I believe in Mr. Hankey.

00:20:11.35,00:20:13.84
Howdy-ho!

00:20:14.95,00:20:19.12
Howdy, folks. Gosh, you sure do[br]smell nice and flowery.

00:20:20.16,00:20:21.85
Howdy-ho, Chef.

00:20:22.06,00:20:24.05
Howdy-ho, Mr. Hankey.

00:20:24.33,00:20:27.49
That does it. Screw you guys,[br]I'm going home.

00:20:27.70,00:20:31.73
- I draw the line at talking poo.[br]- What's all the ruckus?

00:20:31.94,00:20:35.00
The whole town is about[br]to kill each other.

00:20:35.21,00:20:39.20
I reckon this could be a job[br]for Mr. Hankey.

00:20:42.11,00:20:43.58
Stop fighting!

00:20:43.78,00:20:46.55
Oh, my God.[br]What the hell is that thing?

00:20:46.75,00:20:49.05
Come on, gang, don't fight.

00:20:49.49,00:20:53.82
You people focus so hard[br]on the things wrong with Christmas...

00:20:54.02,00:20:56.62
...that you've forgotten[br]what's right about it.

00:20:57.70,00:21:00.69
Don't you see?[br]This is the one time of year...

00:21:00.90,00:21:03.66
...we're supposed to forget[br]the bad stuff.

00:21:03.83,00:21:07.20
Stop worrying and being sad about[br]the state of the world...

00:21:07.40,00:21:10.46
...and for just one day say,[br]"The heck with it."

00:21:10.64,00:21:13.77
"Let's sing and dance[br]and bake cookies."

00:21:25.39,00:21:27.52
Dude, this is pretty f* * * ed up.

00:21:31.43,00:21:33.52
Howdy-ho, Kyle.

00:21:33.73,00:21:37.67
- Oh, no. I'm not sane yet.[br]- I brought some friends with me.

00:21:37.87,00:21:39.17
Friends?

00:21:42.44,00:21:45.27
Merry Christmas, Kyle Broflovski!

00:21:45.48,00:21:47.74
You can see him? I'm not crazy?

00:22:11.20,00:22:13.97
Well, I've got a long night[br]ahead of me.

00:22:14.17,00:22:16.16
Bye-bye. Merry Christmas.

00:22:16.61,00:22:20.70
Goodbye. Bring me lots of gifts.[br]I always believed in you.

00:22:20.91,00:22:22.97
Howdy-ho, ho, ho!

00:22:23.18,00:22:26.62
I learned something today.[br]Jewish people are okay.

00:22:26.82,00:22:29.05
And Channukah can be cool too.

00:22:30.92,00:22:33.39
It seems like something's[br]still not right.

00:22:33.59,00:22:35.89
Yeah, something feels unfinished.

00:22:37.16,00:22:38.49
What could it be?
