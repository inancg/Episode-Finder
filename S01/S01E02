00:00:02.54,00:00:06.60
And now, a fireside chat[br]with the creators of South Park:

00:00:06.78,00:00:10.24
Matt Stone and Trey Parker.

00:00:15.99,00:00:19.15
- Oh, hello. I'm Trey Parker.[br]- I'm Matt Stone.

00:00:19.36,00:00:22.52
This here's old Scratch.[br]Say hi, old fella.

00:00:22.69,00:00:27.93
This episode is called "Weight Gain[br]4000." It's our favorite episode.

00:00:28.10,00:00:30.86
Kathie Lee Gifford comes[br]to South Park...

00:00:31.04,00:00:35.10
...and Eric Cartman beefs[br]himself up for the big day.

00:00:35.31,00:00:38.64
How much weight does Cartman[br]gain in this episode?

00:00:38.81,00:00:42.77
After Cartman eats Weight Gain 4000,[br]he gains 700 pounds.

00:00:42.98,00:00:45.97
That makes him as heavy[br]as Sally Struthers.

00:00:46.18,00:00:51.35
Has Kathie Lee Gifford offended you?[br]Was she flattered by her depiction?

00:00:51.52,00:00:54.32
We don't really care.[br]We think she's a fu...

00:00:54.53,00:01:00.49
Very wonderful woman. Both Trey and I[br]really respect her work with Regis.

00:01:00.97,00:01:04.13
Guns and bullets seem[br]to be a recurring theme.

00:01:04.30,00:01:07.17
Have either of you ever killed anyone?

00:01:07.84,00:01:11.67
I would never kill somebody,[br]unless they pissed me off.

00:01:12.01,00:01:15.67
Why do you keep killing Kenny?[br]What did he do to you?

00:01:15.85,00:01:18.84
Kenny is definitely[br]our favorite character.

00:01:19.05,00:01:24.55
But we have to kill him every episode.[br]This is one of our favorite deaths.

00:01:24.72,00:01:30.25
How do you create a show like South[br]Park and remain pure and wholesome?

00:01:30.43,00:01:34.76
Everyone thinks that to do South Park,[br]we must be wild rock stars...

00:01:34.93,00:01:37.63
...but we're wholesome[br]Middle American guys.

00:01:37.80,00:01:43.26
We enjoy soda pop, baseball and beating[br]up old people as much as anybody.

00:01:43.84,00:01:49.28
So, now sit back, relax and enjoy[br]"Weight Gain 4000."

00:02:21.75,00:02:22.84
Weight Gain 4000

00:02:27.35,00:02:31.22
- Did you see that rainbow this morning?[br]- It was huge.

00:02:31.42,00:02:32.91
I hate those things!

00:02:33.09,00:02:36.89
- Nobody hates rainbows.[br]- What's there to hate about them?

00:02:37.10,00:02:42.23
Well, you'll be minding your business[br]and they'll come marching in...

00:02:42.43,00:02:46.43
...and crawl up your leg[br]and bite the inside of your ass.

00:02:46.61,00:02:52.67
And you'll be all like, "Hey, get out[br]of my ass, you stupid rainbows!"

00:02:53.45,00:02:58.71
- What the hell are you talking about?[br]- Rainbows. I hate those things.

00:02:58.88,00:03:03.18
Rainbows are those arches of color[br]that show up when it rains.

00:03:03.36,00:03:07.69
Oh, rainbows! Oh, yeah, I like those.[br]Those are cool.

00:03:07.86,00:03:11.09
- What were you talking about?[br]- Nothing, forget it.

00:03:11.26,00:03:14.60
What crawls up your leg[br]and bites the inside of your ass?

00:03:14.77,00:03:15.76
Nothing!

00:03:15.93,00:03:20.30
Children, remember the Save Our[br]Fragile Planet essay contest...

00:03:20.47,00:03:23.74
...that you worked[br]so hard on last month?

00:03:24.78,00:03:29.51
One of our very own South Park[br]students has won the national prize.

00:03:29.68,00:03:31.77
Wow, I knew I would win.

00:03:31.95,00:03:35.48
- Mr. Garrison, this sure is exciting.[br]- Right, Mr. Hat.

00:03:35.65,00:03:39.92
The winner of the national Save Our[br]Fragile Planet contest is:

00:03:40.09,00:03:41.39
Eric Cartman.

00:03:41.56,00:03:42.79
- What?![br]- What?!

00:03:42.96,00:03:46.19
Congratulations on writing[br]the winning paper.

00:03:46.36,00:03:47.63
Kick ass!

00:03:47.80,00:03:51.50
Cartman doesn't know[br]a rain forest from a Pop-Tart.

00:03:51.67,00:03:53.80
Yeah, I do. Pop-Tarts are frosted.

00:03:53.97,00:03:58.31
Out of over a million papers,[br]Eric's was chosen as the winner.

00:03:58.48,00:04:02.64
- Wow! What did you write about?[br]- You know, this and that.

00:04:02.81,00:04:06.27
- He doesn't know what he wrote.[br]- What was your paper about?

00:04:06.45,00:04:10.11
It was on the suffering[br]of bottle-nosed dolphins.

00:04:10.29,00:04:14.59
You shouldn't have written[br]about dolphins. Dolphins are stupid.

00:04:14.76,00:04:18.82
Dude, dolphins are the second[br]smartest animal on the planet.

00:04:19.00,00:04:24.20
Right. If they're so damn smart, how[br]come they get caught in fishing nets?

00:04:24.37,00:04:26.23
- What?[br]- Wait, there's more.

00:04:26.40,00:04:32.14
It says here that Eric's trophy[br]will be presented to him by...

00:04:32.31,00:04:34.28
...Kathie Lee Gifford?

00:04:34.45,00:04:36.44
Kathie Lee is coming here?

00:04:36.62,00:04:39.48
The presentation[br]will be on television.

00:04:39.65,00:04:40.91
Television?

00:04:41.12,00:04:45.06
Kathie Lee Gifford.[br]I don't believe it.

00:04:45.22,00:04:48.62
Kathie Lee Gifford in South Park!

00:04:48.79,00:04:52.89
Oh, my God! This is our chance[br]to make a name for ourselves...

00:04:53.06,00:04:56.03
...to show we're not some pissant[br]mountain town.

00:04:56.20,00:04:58.86
It's a chance for you[br]to get publicity.

00:04:59.04,00:05:04.60
If I can show how much I turned South[br]Park around, I could become a senator!

00:05:04.78,00:05:08.91
- Maybe even a state senator![br]- Let's decorate the town square.

00:05:09.08,00:05:14.45
We should have the chef of the school[br]sing and show our ethnic diversity.

00:05:14.62,00:05:17.45
That's right![br]He's a black guy, isn't he?

00:05:17.62,00:05:19.32
Black as the night.

00:05:19.49,00:05:23.89
Yes! And we can have the children[br]of South Park put on a play.

00:05:24.06,00:05:25.89
Kathie Lee loves children.

00:05:26.06,00:05:29.19
If they're working[br]in a sweatshop, that is.

00:05:29.94,00:05:30.96
Thank you.

00:05:31.14,00:05:32.66
You guys, guess what?

00:05:32.84,00:05:36.57
After I'm on television,[br]I'm gonna be totally famous.

00:05:36.74,00:05:38.47
Hitler was famous too.

00:05:38.64,00:05:40.51
- Hello, children.[br]- Hey, Chef.

00:05:40.68,00:05:43.05
- How are my little crackers?[br]- Good.

00:05:43.22,00:05:47.17
Did you hear? Kathie Lee Gifford[br]is coming to South Park!

00:05:47.35,00:05:50.69
Because Cartman cheated[br]and won the essay contest.

00:05:50.89,00:05:56.52
Yeah, whatever. But the mayor called[br]and asked me to sing at the ceremony.

00:05:56.70,00:05:59.10
- Are you gonna do it?[br]- Of course.

00:05:59.26,00:06:03.67
Kathie Lee is a beautiful,[br]sultry queen of sexual fantasy.

00:06:03.84,00:06:09.64
If I sing to her, maybe I can lure her[br]into a night of exotic delectation.

00:06:09.81,00:06:11.37
Yeah, that'd be cool!

00:06:12.94,00:06:16.81
Well, three times bigger[br]than Frank Gifford's, anyway.

00:06:16.98,00:06:22.08
I can't concentrate on grading papers[br]with all this excitement.

00:06:22.35,00:06:24.69
Why are you looking at me like that?

00:06:24.86,00:06:29.38
Have you forgotten the pain[br]and suffering Kathie Lee caused you?

00:06:29.56,00:06:34.09
Mr. Hat, that was a long time ago,[br]and I was only a child.

00:06:34.27,00:06:36.56
We could've won that talent show.

00:06:37.90,00:06:40.20
- Knock, knock, Mr. Hat.[br]- Who's there?

00:06:40.37,00:06:42.17
- Orange.[br]- Orange who?

00:06:42.34,00:06:46.17
Orange you glad I didn't say banana?

00:06:47.25,00:06:48.94
Thank you.

00:06:50.55,00:06:53.42
Wow, Mr. Hat.[br]Looks like we might win.

00:06:53.59,00:06:56.61
And now, our last[br]talent-show finalist...

00:06:56.79,00:06:58.92
...Kathie Lee Epstein.

00:07:29.19,00:07:34.52
It wasn't fair. She had choreography.[br]How could we compete with that?

00:07:34.69,00:07:39.10
But she's coming to South Park,[br]and I know how to make it better.

00:07:39.26,00:07:40.63
How?

00:07:40.97,00:07:44.37
No, Mr. Hat! I couldn't...

00:07:44.54,00:07:48.30
...kill Kathie Lee Gifford.

00:07:50.54,00:07:54.07
Children, as you all know,[br]Mrs. Kathie Lee Gifford...

00:07:54.25,00:07:58.27
...will be here to present the award[br]to some kid for an essay.

00:07:58.45,00:08:00.21
- That kid is me![br]- Whatever.

00:08:00.39,00:08:03.38
I'm going to have[br]you luscious youngsters...

00:08:03.56,00:08:06.89
...do a play about the history[br]of South Park.

00:08:07.06,00:08:09.36
That's wonderful, right, Mr. Hat?

00:08:09.53,00:08:10.99
- Kill her![br]- Mr. Hat!

00:08:11.16,00:08:14.56
Mr. Garrison, I'm asking you[br]to direct our play.

00:08:14.73,00:08:15.89
That's perfect.

00:08:16.07,00:08:20.53
You see, Mr. Hat, we don't have[br]to kill her. We can upstage her.

00:08:20.71,00:08:25.44
You might want to review the essays.[br]We think Cartman cheated.

00:08:25.61,00:08:32.04
Who cares? Now, kids, what's say[br]we give it our South Park best!

00:08:33.52,00:08:37.72
- Who's our little prizewinner again?[br]- Me, Eric Cartman!

00:08:37.89,00:08:42.42
How about we get in shape? We want[br]to look our best on TV, don't we?

00:08:42.59,00:08:43.58
Yes, ma'am.

00:08:43.76,00:08:47.70
I'm gonna be on television[br]I'm gonna be on television

00:08:49.27,00:08:53.23
I'm gonna be on television[br]I'm gonna be on television

00:08:53.41,00:08:56.93
We don't believe you won[br]that contest fairly, fat boy.

00:08:57.11,00:09:00.98
Stop defending your girlfriend[br]for writing about stupid fish.

00:09:01.15,00:09:05.98
- Dolphins are intelligent and friendly.[br]- Intelligent and friendly on rye bread.

00:09:06.15,00:09:10.52
- Dolphins are smarter than you.[br]- Then why do they live in igloos?

00:09:10.69,00:09:14.52
- That's not dolphins. That's Eskimos![br]- Who cares?

00:09:14.69,00:09:18.49
- It's tree-hugging hippie crap.[br]- Tell me what you wrote!

00:09:18.66,00:09:21.39
I can't. I have to go home[br]and get in shape!

00:09:21.57,00:09:26.03
Yeah, right! You'll go watch TV[br]and eat Cheesy Poofs, ass-master.

00:09:26.20,00:09:27.54
Screw you, hippie!

00:09:28.87,00:09:32.17
We'll be right back[br]to Jesus and Pals after this.

00:09:32.34,00:09:35.74
Need to get in shape fast?[br]Wanna look your best?

00:09:35.91,00:09:39.85
Tired of not getting chicks?[br]Tired of being a 90-pound weakling?

00:09:40.02,00:09:42.25
Yeah, I only weigh 90 pounds.

00:09:42.42,00:09:45.75
Then bulk up quick[br]with Weight Gain 4000!

00:09:45.92,00:09:50.66
Over 4000 grams of saturated fat[br]per serving. Its formula is designed...

00:09:50.83,00:09:55.27
...to go to the stomach,[br]where it is distributed to the blood!

00:09:55.43,00:09:57.92
Now available at stores everywhere.

00:09:58.10,00:10:00.30
- Say it with me, "Beefcake!"[br]- Beefcake.

00:10:00.47,00:10:01.87
- Beefcake![br]- Beefcake!

00:10:03.71,00:10:06.54
May cause irreversible damage[br]to kidneys and liver.

00:10:06.71,00:10:09.65
Mom, can you get me[br]some Weight Gain 4000?

00:10:09.81,00:10:13.05
Okay, Eric.[br]I'll get you some tomorrow.

00:10:13.22,00:10:16.15
But, Mom, I need it for tomorrow!

00:10:16.32,00:10:19.15
But tomorrow is grocery day, Eric.

00:10:19.32,00:10:20.79
Mom!

00:10:22.09,00:10:27.43
Okay, okay. Well, I guess[br]I'll be going to the store now, then.

00:10:33.07,00:10:34.40
No, no!

00:10:35.91,00:10:37.50
Kill her!

00:10:37.68,00:10:39.70
No, Mr. Hat, I won't do it.

00:10:39.88,00:10:42.14
Kill!

00:10:43.52,00:10:47.88
That does it. You're going[br]in the dresser drawer, Mr. Hat.

00:10:48.55,00:10:53.68
- She'll make a fool of you again.[br]- Stay in that drawer, negative Nancy.

00:10:53.86,00:10:55.02
Hey, dudes.

00:10:55.19,00:10:59.76
What is wrong with you? Haven't you[br]noticed the snow on the ground?

00:10:59.93,00:11:03.39
I have a nice body,[br]and I wanna show it off!

00:11:03.57,00:11:08.53
- What? You've got to weigh 90 pounds![br]- I'm up to 94, thank you very much.

00:11:09.87,00:11:13.17
Yeah, they're almost[br]as big as his mom's!

00:11:13.34,00:11:17.47
Laugh all you want! I'll be the one[br]on TV looking all buff.

00:11:17.65,00:11:21.75
- What's that stuff?[br]- Weight Gain 4000. It's bulking me up.

00:11:21.92,00:11:24.62
- Bulk up to what? Fat-ass?[br]- Super fat-ass?

00:11:24.79,00:11:30.16
Hey, I don't have to take that kind[br]of crap from you scrawny weaklings!

00:11:32.36,00:11:37.39
Sweet, check me out. I'm such a[br]beefcake I can't get through the door.

00:11:37.57,00:11:40.97
Come on, people. We've got[br]to turn this place around.

00:11:41.14,00:11:45.30
Hang up the lights, string up[br]the banners, castrate the cows!

00:11:46.88,00:11:50.37
Well, Mr. Garrison,[br]how is the little play going?

00:11:50.55,00:11:53.75
Fine. We were just about[br]to run it from the top.

00:11:53.92,00:11:57.08
Oh, please do. I'm dying to see it.

00:11:57.26,00:12:00.69
All the little pioneers[br]on this side of the stage.

00:12:00.86,00:12:04.26
All the little Indians[br]to the center of the stage.

00:12:04.43,00:12:08.16
- Am I an Indian or a pioneer?[br]- You have a feather on your head?

00:12:08.33,00:12:11.20
- Yes.[br]- Then you're an Indian.

00:12:11.37,00:12:13.27
Bebe, this is your line.

00:12:13.44,00:12:16.84
This is the story of South Park.

00:12:17.01,00:12:20.17
It begins over 1 00 years ago...

00:12:20.35,00:12:26.48
...when the noble and hearty[br]Ute Indians lived on the land.

00:12:28.62,00:12:31.15
Oh, don't they look adorable?

00:12:31.32,00:12:35.26
Then from the East came[br]the great white pioneers.

00:12:40.60,00:12:43.73
- Oh, my God![br]- They did it better this morning.

00:12:43.90,00:12:45.33
They had more energy.

00:12:45.50,00:12:48.27
The pioneers met with the Indians...

00:12:48.44,00:12:52.54
...and negotiated[br]for their fertile lands.

00:12:52.74,00:12:58.05
We cannot have our children beating[br]each other in front of Kathie Lee!

00:12:58.22,00:13:01.19
What do you want?[br]This is how it happened.

00:13:01.35,00:13:03.55
Take that, you stupid Indian!

00:13:03.72,00:13:06.62
Mr. Garrison, this is not appropriate!

00:13:06.79,00:13:11.13
Do you actually think that[br]Kathie Lee Gifford would enjoy this?

00:13:11.30,00:13:14.42
To hell with Kathie Lee Gifford!

00:13:16.00,00:13:17.70
What have I said?

00:13:17.87,00:13:20.67
He said,[br]"To hell with Kathie Lee Gifford!"

00:13:20.97,00:13:26.38
Mr. Garrison, I am dismissing you[br]from directing our play.

00:13:28.61,00:13:33.81
It happened again, didn't it?[br]Now we do things my way.

00:13:34.02,00:13:36.89
I can't kill her, Mr. Hat.

00:13:37.06,00:13:40.08
You're gonna have to do it.

00:13:45.96,00:13:50.56
- Cartman, talk about wide load.[br]- I'm starting to fill out nicely.

00:13:50.74,00:13:53.43
No, you're not.[br]You're fatter than ever!

00:13:53.60,00:13:55.97
I'm not fat, I'm getting in shape!

00:13:56.14,00:13:59.70
You're such a fat-ass,[br]when you walk around, people go:

00:13:59.88,00:14:01.97
"Goddamn, that's a big fat-ass!"

00:14:02.15,00:14:04.64
No, they don't, you jealous weakling!

00:14:04.85,00:14:08.18
Goddamn, that's a big fat-ass!

00:14:08.52,00:14:11.39
- Hi, guys.[br]- Oh, look, another hippie.

00:14:11.56,00:14:14.32
- Peace, Wendy.[br]- Shut up, Cartman!

00:14:14.49,00:14:16.98
Two little hippies sitting in a tree

00:14:17.26,00:14:21.13
I'll find Cartman's paper[br]and get to the bottom of this.

00:14:22.97,00:14:26.49
- Can I help you?[br]- Yes. I need a gun.

00:14:26.67,00:14:29.97
Would this be for hunting,[br]protection or other?

00:14:30.14,00:14:31.73
- Other.[br]- Alrighty then.

00:14:31.91,00:14:35.64
May I suggest a Stratford 1 2 mm?[br]Go ahead. Try it on!

00:14:36.38,00:14:40.75
That looks nice on you.[br]The lacquered black matches your eyes.

00:14:40.92,00:14:44.29
You talking to me?[br]You talking to me?

00:14:44.56,00:14:48.51
- I don't know, it's a little small.[br]- Okay. How about this?

00:14:48.69,00:14:51.96
You talking to me?[br]I don't like this one either.

00:14:52.13,00:14:54.72
Here's the same gun[br]with a wood finish.

00:14:54.90,00:14:56.09
You talking to me?!

00:14:56.33,00:15:00.50
I don't see anybody else here,[br]so you must be talking to me.

00:15:00.67,00:15:01.97
I'll take it.

00:15:02.64,00:15:03.80
Hello?

00:15:20.49,00:15:22.96
"My essay, by Eric Cartman.

00:15:23.13,00:15:27.22
When I wrote the following pages,[br]or rather the bulk of them...

00:15:27.40,00:15:30.77
...I lived alone in the woods[br]on the shore of..."

00:15:32.77,00:15:38.07
Mr. Hat, old Kathie Lee really will be[br]surprised when she gets here tomorrow.

00:15:38.24,00:15:41.61
She beat us in the talent show[br]all those years ago.

00:15:41.78,00:15:44.04
I think we owe her for that.

00:15:45.78,00:15:47.05
Oh, my God!

00:15:54.36,00:15:57.69
- Howdy, Mr. Garrison. Nice gun.[br]- Thank you.

00:15:57.86,00:16:01.09
- Nice gun, Mr. Garrison.[br]- Thanks.

00:16:01.27,00:16:03.67
- Hello, Officer Barbrady.[br]- Nice gun.

00:16:03.84,00:16:09.80
Is there somewhere in town I can get a[br]good, clear shot...? View of Kathie Lee?

00:16:10.04,00:16:13.70
I think the book depository[br]would be a good bet.

00:16:16.55,00:16:20.64
That might do quite nicely.[br]Thank you, Officer Barbrady.

00:16:20.82,00:16:22.38
No problem.

00:16:22.62,00:16:26.18
Caught you red-handed![br]No pictures of Kathie Lee!

00:16:27.23,00:16:29.19
Where is she?

00:16:30.06,00:16:35.40
This is sweet. Camera crews are[br]setting up, and I look totally ripped.

00:16:35.57,00:16:39.83
- Beefcake. Beefcake![br]- They won't get all of you in frame.

00:16:40.04,00:16:42.67
- Guys, we have to stop him![br]- Stop who?

00:16:42.84,00:16:47.24
Mr. Garrison! He's going to try[br]to kill Kathie Lee Gifford!

00:16:47.41,00:16:50.74
No, you don't![br]You won't ruin my moment of fame.

00:16:50.92,00:16:52.11
He's got a gun!

00:16:52.28,00:16:55.01
You gotta get over[br]this jealousy thing.

00:16:55.19,00:16:59.05
Seriously, just face it.[br]I wrote a better paper than you.

00:16:59.22,00:17:03.79
It just so happens that I have[br]your paper, and I know why you won.

00:17:03.96,00:17:06.69
There's something more important now.

00:17:06.86,00:17:10.06
You've got to prioritize.[br]What's more important:

00:17:10.23,00:17:13.20
Being on TV[br]or some stupid assassination?

00:17:13.37,00:17:17.21
Stan, I can't do it alone. Please?

00:17:17.38,00:17:19.00
We're losing him.

00:17:19.18,00:17:20.77
Here she comes!

00:17:28.29,00:17:32.45
Damn, I'm not the only one[br]who's thought of killing her.

00:17:32.62,00:17:35.22
We love you, Kathie Lee!

00:17:35.39,00:17:37.05
We love you too.

00:17:37.23,00:17:40.36
Come on, you little bitch.

00:17:40.53,00:17:43.76
You've gotta leave your precious[br]bubble sometime.

00:17:43.94,00:17:48.00
It is with great pride and honor[br]that I'd like to welcome...

00:17:48.17,00:17:51.84
...Mrs. Kathie Lee Gifford[br]to South Park!

00:17:54.41,00:17:58.11
And now our very own[br]South Park Elementary chef...

00:17:58.32,00:18:02.15
...will sing a special song[br]in honor of Mrs. Lee Gifford!

00:18:03.25,00:18:04.88
Thank you, Mr. Mayor.

00:18:05.09,00:18:08.99
You know, Kathie Lee,[br]you are a very special woman.

00:18:09.16,00:18:12.62
I don't mean special[br]in a Mary Tyler Moore way...

00:18:12.83,00:18:16.73
...or special in an extra-value meal[br]at Happy Burger way.

00:18:16.93,00:18:21.67
No, no, no. I mean special.[br]Like the song of the hummingbird...

00:18:21.87,00:18:25.47
...as it gets ready to find[br]that female hummingbird...

00:18:25.68,00:18:28.70
...and make sweet love[br]to it all night long.

00:18:28.91,00:18:32.08
Just two hummingbirds[br]moaning and groaning...

00:18:32.25,00:18:36.74
...and letting their bodies caress[br]and touch each other in ecstasy.

00:18:47.30,00:18:48.86
What?

00:18:51.24,00:18:52.70
What?!

00:18:54.31,00:18:58.64
Thank you, Chef,[br]for that heartwarming song.

00:18:58.81,00:19:01.33
Thank you, Chef!

00:19:01.65,00:19:04.55
God bless you, Kathie Lee!

00:19:05.12,00:19:09.52
Mr. Garrison is about to kill[br]Kathie Lee! We have to find him!

00:19:09.72,00:19:13.21
What? You mean the teacher?[br]Wait a minute.

00:19:13.86,00:19:19.32
Is there somewhere in town I can get a[br]good, clear shot...? View of Kathie Lee?

00:19:19.80,00:19:23.13
I think the book depository[br]would be a good bet.

00:19:23.30,00:19:26.93
I think the book depository[br]would be a good bet.

00:19:27.10,00:19:29.33
Book depository. Depository.

00:19:29.51,00:19:33.20
Damn, he could be anywhere![br]I'll send out an APB.

00:19:33.38,00:19:35.61
Wendy, look!

00:19:35.91,00:19:38.88
And now, here to present the award...

00:19:39.08,00:19:42.81
...for the environmental essay[br]to our own Eric Kaufman...

00:19:43.02,00:19:44.65
Cartman, goddamn it!

00:19:44.82,00:19:47.92
...is your favorite celebrity[br]and mine...

00:19:48.36,00:19:51.39
...Kathie Lee Gifford!

00:19:55.07,00:19:57.23
Thank you. I love you all.

00:19:57.50,00:19:59.33
Mr. Garrison! Stop!

00:19:59.50,00:20:02.84
Leave us. We must finish[br]what we have begun.

00:20:03.01,00:20:06.31
I know she's hurt you.[br]She's hurt a lot of people.

00:20:06.48,00:20:10.31
- You can't know.[br]- You should've won that talent show.

00:20:10.48,00:20:14.94
It is with honor and pride[br]that I present the winner this trophy.

00:20:15.12,00:20:20.68
- Eric, would you please come up here?[br]- Here it is, my big moment of fame.

00:20:20.86,00:20:24.76
Then she threw her voice[br]with two dummies at once.

00:20:24.93,00:20:27.99
I know that,[br]but this isn't the answer.

00:20:28.17,00:20:31.46
It is too late for me, young Wendy.

00:20:33.57,00:20:37.53
I've learned something today.[br]You can't win all the time.

00:20:37.71,00:20:41.97
If you don't win, you can't hold it[br]against the person who did...

00:20:42.18,00:20:45.67
...because that's the only way[br]you ever really lose.

00:20:45.85,00:20:48.08
You're right.

00:20:48.25,00:20:49.74
Good.

00:20:49.95,00:20:53.19
She really threw her voice[br]with two dummies?

00:20:53.36,00:20:54.76
The bitch must die!

00:21:04.44,00:21:08.50
Oh, my God, they killed Kenny![br]You bastard!

00:21:08.97,00:21:10.44
- Gun![br]- Gun!

00:21:10.64,00:21:15.17
Hey, come back![br]We didn't even get to do our play!

00:21:15.78,00:21:17.37
That's it. Wrap it up.

00:21:17.55,00:21:21.45
Hey, wait a minute.[br]When do I get to be on television?

00:21:21.62,00:21:24.52
Forget it.[br]No Kathie Lee, no public interest.

00:21:24.69,00:21:28.09
But I won the environmental[br]essay contest!

00:21:28.26,00:21:32.03
You don't deserve to win, Cartman,[br]and you know it!

00:21:32.20,00:21:37.10
I'm holding Cartman's paper. It's[br]actually nothing more than Walden...

00:21:37.27,00:21:42.26
...with Thoreau's name crossed out and[br]Cartman's name written in its place.

00:21:42.47,00:21:45.53
- Who cares?[br]- Kathie Lee Gifford's gone.

00:21:45.71,00:21:49.20
What about not holding anything[br]against the winner?

00:21:49.38,00:21:51.68
Well, not if it's Cartman.

00:21:51.85,00:21:56.88
Hey, where are you all going?[br]They don't even know what Walden is.

00:21:57.05,00:22:00.65
I bet if Walden was a sitcom[br]you'd know what it was!

00:22:00.83,00:22:04.16
Come on. Kyle's mom will make[br]tuna-fish sandwiches.

00:22:04.33,00:22:05.49
What the hell.

00:22:06.10,00:22:11.19
No, no! Now I'll be stuck[br]in this Podunk town forever...

00:22:11.40,00:22:16.64
...with all these stupid, hick,[br]redneck, jobless, truck-driving idiots!

00:22:16.81,00:22:19.17
Mayor, the mike is on.

00:22:19.38,00:22:22.17
Thought you could get away[br]with it, Mr. Hat?

00:22:22.35,00:22:25.44
I would have, if it weren't[br]for those meddling kids.

00:22:25.62,00:22:29.99
You're lucky you missed Kathie Lee[br]and that nobody got hurt.

00:22:32.06,00:22:34.65
We hope you can come back[br]to school soon.

00:22:34.83,00:22:38.96
I'd love to, but the doctors say[br]Mr. Hat needs more therapy.

00:22:39.13,00:22:41.29
We can still get her!

00:22:41.47,00:22:45.60
I'm just sorry I ruined everyone's[br]chances for being on TV.

00:22:45.77,00:22:48.40
Not Cartman.[br]He gets to be on TV anyway.

00:22:48.57,00:22:50.13
Really? On what?

00:22:50.31,00:22:51.64
Obesity.

00:22:51.81,00:22:53.87
Adiposity. Corpulence.

00:22:54.08,00:22:57.34
Whatever word you use,[br]it represents one thing:

00:22:57.51,00:22:59.00
Being a big fat-ass.

00:22:59.18,00:23:03.21
We have with us via satellite[br]Eric Cartman from South Park...

00:23:03.39,00:23:07.26
...who is now so obese,[br]he can't even get out of his house.

00:23:07.42,00:23:09.65
When is this gonna be on the air?

00:23:09.83,00:23:12.99
Is there anything you'd like[br]to say to the people?

00:23:13.60,00:23:15.22
Follow your dreams.

00:23:15.40,00:23:18.84
You can reach your goals.[br]I'm living proof.

00:23:19.00,00:23:20.80
Beefcake. Beefcake!

00:23:20.97,00:23:24.07
He needs to run his ass[br]around the block.

00:23:24.28,00:23:26.74
How about more of that good loving?

00:23:26.91,00:23:30.07
Damn! I gave you sweet loving[br]five minutes ago!

00:23:30.25,00:23:31.98
You trying to kill me?
