00:00:02.77,00:00:06.80
And now, a fireside chat[br]with the creators of South Park:

00:00:06.98,00:00:09.85
Matt Stone and Trey Parker.

00:00:14.55,00:00:17.04
- Hi. I'm Trey Parker.[br]- I'm Matt Stone.

00:00:17.26,00:00:22.59
- This is Scratch. Say hi, old fella.[br]- We do a show called South Park.

00:00:22.83,00:00:25.32
Tell us a little about yourselves.

00:00:25.53,00:00:29.73
I met Matthew at the University[br]of Colorado in film school.

00:00:29.94,00:00:33.00
I actually met him[br]in beginning filmmaking.

00:00:33.17,00:00:38.27
I found someone who could make me[br]laugh, even when I felt like crying.

00:00:39.41,00:00:42.40
Guys, who would you say[br]are your role models?

00:00:42.58,00:00:45.91
I'd have to say my biggest[br]role model is Matt.

00:00:46.12,00:00:49.14
I'd have to say mine[br]is Theodore Roosevelt...

00:00:49.35,00:00:51.91
...for his work with the Rough Riders.

00:00:52.12,00:00:54.15
Tell us about this episode.

00:00:54.33,00:00:58.23
It's called "Cartman Gets[br]an Anal Probe." It's our favorite.

00:00:58.40,00:01:01.16
Kyle's brother Ike[br]is abducted by aliens...

00:01:01.33,00:01:04.60
...and Cartman has strange things[br]implanted in his ass.

00:01:04.77,00:01:08.21
The reason this episode[br]is old Scratch's favorite...

00:01:08.41,00:01:12.84
...is because it's the only episode[br]we animated all by ourselves.

00:01:13.01,00:01:16.31
This was the pilot,[br]done before we had a series...

00:01:16.48,00:01:19.38
...so we had to do[br]the whole thing ourselves.

00:01:19.55,00:01:23.92
For several months, we were locked[br]into a cold, dark, little room...

00:01:24.09,00:01:26.39
...for long periods of time.

00:01:26.83,00:01:31.19
That "kick the baby" game looks fun.[br]Have you played it personally?

00:01:31.40,00:01:33.66
Neither of us have children.

00:01:33.87,00:01:37.63
The only family we have[br]is each other and old Scratch.

00:01:37.80,00:01:41.47
- We're not married yet.[br]- We can't even get dates.

00:01:41.64,00:01:46.81
The truth is, until we have children,[br]we won't know whether we'll kick them.

00:01:47.31,00:01:51.48
You write alien-encounter material[br]with a certain knowledge.

00:01:51.65,00:01:55.64
Have either of you[br]actually been abducted?

00:01:56.96,00:02:01.39
Trey, it's okay.[br]Go ahead and tell them.

00:02:01.56,00:02:05.89
I grew up near South Park,[br]so I was abducted as a small child.

00:02:06.06,00:02:10.30
I remember the experience.[br]I remember how horrible it was.

00:02:10.47,00:02:12.87
I remember too much.

00:02:13.91,00:02:19.57
So sit back, relax and enjoy[br]"Cartman Gets an Anal Probe."

00:02:51.91,00:02:53.78
Cartman Gets an Anal Probe

00:02:56.58,00:03:01.11
Damn it! My little brother's trying[br]to follow me to school again.

00:03:01.29,00:03:04.35
Ike, you can't come to school with me.

00:03:04.56,00:03:08.89
- Go home, you little dildo.[br]- Dude, don't call my brother a dildo.

00:03:09.06,00:03:10.86
- What's a dildo?[br]- I don't know.

00:03:11.03,00:03:14.40
- Cartman doesn't know either.[br]- I know what it is!

00:03:14.57,00:03:17.30
- Well, what?[br]- I'm not telling you.

00:03:17.47,00:03:19.56
What's a dildo, Kenny?

00:03:22.51,00:03:26.60
Yeah, that's what Kyle's[br]little brother is, all right.

00:03:27.68,00:03:30.31
- That kicks ass.[br]- Check this one out.

00:03:30.48,00:03:33.75
- Ready, Ike? Kick the baby.[br]- Don't kick the baby.

00:03:33.92,00:03:35.32
Kick the baby.

00:03:38.52,00:03:41.08
Looks like you didn't get much sleep.

00:03:41.26,00:03:45.06
- I had these bogus nightmares.[br]- Really? What about?

00:03:45.23,00:03:49.50
Well, I dreamt that I was lying[br]in my bed, in the dark...

00:03:49.67,00:03:53.90
...when all of a sudden,[br]this bright blue light filled the room.

00:03:54.11,00:03:58.37
And slowly my bedroom door opened.[br]The next thing I remember...

00:03:58.54,00:04:01.44
...I was being dragged[br]through a hallway.

00:04:01.61,00:04:06.07
Then I was on a table, and these[br]scary aliens wanted to operate on me.

00:04:06.25,00:04:08.88
And they had big heads and black eyes.

00:04:09.05,00:04:11.15
- Dude, visitors![br]- What?

00:04:11.32,00:04:15.42
- Those were visitors.[br]- It was just a dream. My mom said so.

00:04:15.59,00:04:19.46
- They're are real.[br]- They abduct people and mutilate cows.

00:04:19.63,00:04:23.59
Shut up. You're trying to scare me,[br]and it's not working.

00:04:24.27,00:04:26.43
- Hello, children.[br]- Hey, Chef.

00:04:26.61,00:04:31.01
- What's for lunch today?[br]- Salisbury steak with buttered noodles.

00:04:31.18,00:04:35.01
- Bean casserole or vegetable medley.[br]- Kick ass.

00:04:35.18,00:04:38.62
Did any of you see[br]the alien spaceship last night?

00:04:38.78,00:04:40.34
Yeah, fat boy saw it.

00:04:40.52,00:04:44.39
That was just a dream.[br]And I'm not fat, I'm big-boned!

00:04:44.56,00:04:48.01
Was it the ones with the big heads[br]and black eyes?

00:04:48.19,00:04:52.36
- They took him on their ship.[br]- Did they give you an anal probe?

00:04:52.53,00:04:53.52
What's that?

00:04:53.70,00:04:56.72
That's when they put a metal hoop[br]up your butt.

00:04:56.90,00:05:02.24
- They gave you an anal probe, Cartman?[br]- No! I mean, why would they do that?

00:05:02.41,00:05:05.67
They did, huh?[br]Aliens stuck stuff up your ass!

00:05:05.84,00:05:07.84
- Anal probe.[br]- Shut up, dildo!

00:05:08.01,00:05:11.31
I gotta get to the cafeteria.[br]Watch that fat boy, now.

00:05:11.48,00:05:13.58
He could be under alien control.

00:05:17.69,00:05:20.52
They were real. Sorry about your ass.

00:05:20.69,00:05:25.46
Goddamn it, they didn't do anything[br]to my ass! It was just a dream.

00:05:27.67,00:05:30.10
- Why you walking so funny?[br]- Shut up!

00:05:30.80,00:05:32.43
No, Ike, go home.

00:05:32.60,00:05:36.63
This is it. This one's for the game.[br]Kick the baby.

00:05:39.98,00:05:43.38
- Good morning, Mrs. Crabtree.[br]- Sit down, we're late!

00:05:48.09,00:05:50.32
- He's still there.[br]- Don't worry.

00:05:50.49,00:05:53.98
If something happens to him,[br]my parents will blame me.

00:05:54.16,00:05:56.46
Sit down back there!

00:05:56.63,00:05:59.56
- Whatever, you fat bitch.[br]- What did you say?!

00:05:59.73,00:06:02.10
I said, I have a bad itch.

00:06:02.73,00:06:04.63
Oh, my God!

00:06:05.67,00:06:07.80
- Visitors![br]- Oh, no!

00:06:07.97,00:06:10.60
Ike! Stop the bus!

00:06:11.08,00:06:13.37
You have to stop this bus!

00:06:13.55,00:06:16.34
- Do you want an office referral?[br]- No.

00:06:16.51,00:06:18.28
- Then sit down![br]- But l...

00:06:25.76,00:06:30.06
- Are those the same visitors you saw?[br]- Shut up, it's not working.

00:06:30.23,00:06:32.82
- We have to do something.[br]- We can't.

00:06:33.00,00:06:36.30
- That fat bitch won't let us.[br]- What did you say?!

00:06:36.47,00:06:41.91
- I said that rabbits eat lettuce.[br]- Well, yes, they certainly do.

00:06:43.17,00:06:47.08
What am I gonna do? My brother[br]has been abducted by aliens.

00:06:47.25,00:06:49.21
You farted.

00:06:50.08,00:06:52.14
Somebody's baking brownies.

00:06:57.79,00:06:59.95
That's the third cow this month.

00:07:00.13,00:07:04.72
At this rate, all my cattle will die[br]before the winter's through.

00:07:04.90,00:07:09.70
This isn't unusual. Cows turn[br]themselves inside out all the time.

00:07:10.87,00:07:14.10
People been saying[br]they've seen UFOs around.

00:07:14.27,00:07:16.30
UFOs?

00:07:16.47,00:07:19.47
And black Army CIA helicopters[br]and trucks.

00:07:19.64,00:07:23.74
That is the silliest thing[br]I've ever heard.

00:07:25.22,00:07:28.19
- What was that?[br]- That was a pigeon.

00:07:28.35,00:07:30.69
What am I supposed to do?

00:07:30.86,00:07:36.09
Just stand here and watch my cattle[br]get mutilated one by one?

00:07:39.10,00:07:40.29
My cattle!

00:07:44.80,00:07:47.50
See? There is something[br]funny going on.

00:07:47.67,00:07:51.70
There's nothing funny going on.[br]I'll get those cows back.

00:07:54.15,00:07:59.58
And now our friend Mr. Hat is going[br]to tell us about Christopher Columbus.

00:07:59.75,00:08:01.62
That's right, Mr. Garrison.

00:08:01.79,00:08:06.49
Columbus discovered America[br]and was the Indians' best friend.

00:08:06.66,00:08:10.49
He helped them win their war[br]against Frederick Douglass...

00:08:10.66,00:08:15.00
...and freed the Hebrews from Napoleon[br]and discovered France.

00:08:15.17,00:08:20.60
I have to help my stupid brother. If I[br]go home without him, my dad will yell:

00:08:20.77,00:08:24.47
"Where's your brother?[br]You weren't looking out for him."

00:08:24.64,00:08:27.58
- Let's go find him.[br]- "He can't think on his own.

00:08:27.78,00:08:30.81
Brush and floss.[br]Where has that finger been?"

00:08:30.98,00:08:32.85
- Dude![br]- Is there a problem?

00:08:33.02,00:08:35.75
- Yes, I have to go now.[br]- Really, Kyle?

00:08:35.92,00:08:41.86
- What is it? Another prostate tumor?[br]- My brother's been abducted by aliens.

00:08:42.03,00:08:45.59
It's true. Ask Cartman.[br]They gave him an anal probe.

00:08:45.76,00:08:50.26
- That's a little joke.[br]- Mr. Garrison, seriously, I have to go.

00:08:50.44,00:08:54.63
- Can I please be excused?[br]- I don't know. Did you ask Mr. Hat?

00:08:54.81,00:08:57.60
I don't wanna ask Mr. Hat.[br]I'm asking you!

00:08:57.78,00:09:02.98
- I think you should ask Mr. Hat.[br]- Mr. Hat, may I please be excused?

00:09:03.15,00:09:06.55
Well, Kyle, no![br]You hear me? You go to hell!

00:09:06.72,00:09:10.92
You go to hell and you die![br]You'll have to take your seat.

00:09:11.09,00:09:14.72
- Damn it![br]- Ha-ha, Mr. Hat yelled at you.

00:09:14.93,00:09:17.22
- My ass![br]- Damn, Cartman!

00:09:18.90,00:09:21.87
- My ass![br]- Dude, he's farting fire!

00:09:22.03,00:09:25.83
It's the alien anal probe.[br]It's shooting fire from his rectum!

00:09:26.00,00:09:27.80
No, that was just a dream.

00:09:27.97,00:09:32.27
Do you need to sit in the corner[br]until your gas is under control?

00:09:32.44,00:09:35.38
No, Mr. Garrison, I'm fine.

00:09:46.39,00:09:50.38
You cows can't get on this train.[br]This is a people train.

00:09:50.56,00:09:55.50
You cows have no business on a[br]people train, all right? You're cows.

00:09:55.67,00:10:00.33
Don't try any of that cow hypnosis[br]on me, all right?

00:10:00.51,00:10:04.41
- Because it's not gonna work.[br]- Hold it right there, cows.

00:10:04.91,00:10:06.60
Come back here!

00:10:14.65,00:10:18.32
- I sure am hungry.[br]- How can you eat when you fart fire?

00:10:18.52,00:10:21.29
Shut up, you're being[br]totally immature.

00:10:21.46,00:10:24.43
- Look, there's Wendy Testaburger.[br]- Where?

00:10:40.91,00:10:46.82
- Stan wants to kiss Wendy Testaburger[br]- Shut up, fat ass, I don't like her.

00:10:46.99,00:10:51.75
I'm not fat. You like her because[br]you throw up when she talks to you.

00:10:51.92,00:10:53.48
- I do not.[br]- Hi, guys.

00:10:53.66,00:10:54.82
Hi, Wendy.

00:10:54.99,00:10:58.36
Here, Stan, this is for you.

00:10:58.53,00:10:59.90
Bye, Wendy.

00:11:00.06,00:11:02.56
Dude, what does the note say?

00:11:02.73,00:11:06.90
Holy crap! She wants to meet me[br]at Stark's Pond after school.

00:11:07.07,00:11:10.87
- Whoa, maybe you can kiss her.[br]- Or slip her the tongue.

00:11:12.28,00:11:15.58
What? How do you know she has a cat?

00:11:19.45,00:11:23.44
Let's figure out how to ditch school[br]so we can get Ike back.

00:11:23.62,00:11:25.99
Hello, children. How are you?

00:11:26.19,00:11:27.59
- Bad.[br]- Why bad?

00:11:27.76,00:11:31.56
Have you ever had something happen[br]but nobody believed you?

00:11:31.73,00:11:36.93
Children, that's a problem we've all[br]had to face at some time or another.

00:11:37.10,00:11:41.54
Here, let me sing you a little song.[br]It might clear things up.

00:12:02.49,00:12:04.22
Chef!

00:12:06.56,00:12:08.43
- Do you feel better?[br]- No.

00:12:08.60,00:12:13.20
Come on, children, what can be so bad?[br]It's Salisbury-steak day.

00:12:13.57,00:12:16.73
- Visitors took Kyle's baby brother.[br]- What?!

00:12:16.98,00:12:19.88
What are you doing[br]eating Salisbury steak?

00:12:20.04,00:12:22.67
- Find him![br]- Mr. Garrison won't let us go.

00:12:22.85,00:12:26.75
- He thinks we're making it up.[br]- You are making it up.

00:12:33.52,00:12:35.08
- What?[br]- That was cool!

00:12:35.26,00:12:38.66
It's some kind of symbiotic[br]metamorphosis device.

00:12:38.83,00:12:42.16
This could mean the visitors[br]want to talk to us.

00:12:42.33,00:12:45.33
I see. You're joining in on the joke.

00:12:45.50,00:12:48.13
It's no joke, children. This is big.

00:12:48.31,00:12:51.57
If I don't get out of school[br]and get Ike back...

00:12:51.78,00:12:53.74
...my parents will disown me.

00:12:53.95,00:12:57.04
Hold on now.[br]You got to help the children.

00:12:57.22,00:13:00.78
You guys are going a long way[br]to try and scare me.

00:13:00.95,00:13:03.08
I want my Salisbury steak.

00:13:03.25,00:13:08.59
Fire drill, fire drill! Everybody out![br]Okay, children, this is your chance.

00:13:08.76,00:13:11.32
Killer. Thanks, Chef.

00:13:11.50,00:13:16.93
First contact with the alien visitors.[br]I've gotta get myself ready.

00:13:17.10,00:13:20.50
We got out of school[br]No more school today

00:13:20.67,00:13:22.33
We got out of school

00:13:22.54,00:13:27.50
- You guys, my ass, seriously![br]- Okay, you can stop farting fire now.

00:13:27.68,00:13:31.74
- I can't, you son of a bitch![br]- How do we get my brother back?

00:13:31.92,00:13:34.89
Would you stop going on[br]about your brother?

00:13:35.05,00:13:38.35
It was just a dream![br]I didn't have an anal probe!

00:13:38.52,00:13:41.01
I am not under alien control!

00:13:52.84,00:13:55.64
- What was that?[br]- He is under alien control.

00:13:55.81,00:14:00.71
- His butt's linked up to the visitors.[br]- Son of a bitch!

00:14:04.02,00:14:07.08
Guys, shut up.[br]I'm not under alien control.

00:14:07.25,00:14:11.71
If you visitors can hear me,[br]bring back my brother, goddamn it!

00:14:11.89,00:14:14.38
That hurts, you butt-licker!

00:14:14.76,00:14:18.35
- Kyle, look, it's them.[br]- Give me back my brother!

00:14:22.97,00:14:26.66
- Oh, my God, they killed Kenny![br]- You bastards!

00:14:26.84,00:14:32.07
Come back here! Come back![br]Damn it, we were so close!

00:14:32.28,00:14:35.68
Hey, look. I think Kenny's okay.

00:14:45.89,00:14:47.05
Wow, poor Kenny.

00:14:47.23,00:14:49.32
- Now do you believe us?[br]- No.

00:14:49.49,00:14:52.49
- Cartman, they killed Kenny.[br]- He's not dead.

00:14:52.66,00:14:55.63
Dude, Kenny is dead. See?

00:14:55.80,00:14:58.79
- Shut up, you guys.[br]- He's dead, Cartman.

00:14:58.97,00:15:04.03
Damn it, I didn't have an anal probe![br]Screw you guys, I'm going home.

00:15:04.21,00:15:08.11
- Go on and go home, you fat chicken![br]- Dildo!

00:15:08.28,00:15:11.94
- You're all I have left.[br]- Sorry, I gotta meet Wendy.

00:15:12.12,00:15:16.71
You can't. Poor Ike must be so scared,[br]up there all alone. Help me.

00:15:16.89,00:15:21.45
Like Chef says, "I'm getting a piece[br]of loving while the getting's hot."

00:15:21.63,00:15:22.62
Rats!

00:15:25.36,00:15:27.19
- Hello, Eric.[br]- Hi, Mom.

00:15:27.37,00:15:30.49
- How are you doing?[br]- Well, I'm pissed off.

00:15:30.67,00:15:34.13
Here, I made you powdered-doughnut[br]pancake surprise.

00:15:34.31,00:15:38.11
I don't want it![br]All the kids in school call me fat.

00:15:38.28,00:15:41.47
- You're not fat, you're big-boned.[br]- That's what I said.

00:15:41.65,00:15:44.74
You can have an eensy-weensy bit,[br]can't you?

00:15:44.92,00:15:48.82
- Just a weensy-eensy woo-woo?[br]- No. Leave me alone, Mom.

00:15:48.99,00:15:52.55
How about a nice chocolate[br]chicken potpie then?

00:15:52.76,00:15:55.62
Well, that does sound pretty good.

00:15:55.99,00:15:57.93
- Mom?[br]- Yes, hon?

00:15:58.10,00:16:01.33
If anybody calls or visits,[br]I'm not here, okay?

00:16:01.50,00:16:05.96
- Sure. You want some Cheesy Poofs too?[br]- Yeah, I want Cheesy Poofs.

00:16:09.14,00:16:12.27
She's not coming.[br]Let's look for the visitors.

00:16:12.44,00:16:16.00
- But her note said she'd be here.[br]- Hi, Stan.

00:16:16.61,00:16:21.71
- He throws up when you talk to him.[br]- But why, Stan?

00:16:22.09,00:16:25.52
Would you get down to business[br]so we can find Ike?

00:16:25.69,00:16:29.22
- Make sweet love by the fire.[br]- What happened to Ike?

00:16:29.39,00:16:31.42
As UFO sightings increase...

00:16:31.60,00:16:36.12
...more mysterious crop-circle[br]patterns are appearing in fields.

00:16:36.30,00:16:40.76
These crop circles, when viewed[br]from above, form strange patterns.

00:16:40.94,00:16:44.00
Hey, that kind of looks[br]like Tom Selleck.

00:16:44.18,00:16:48.98
Could it be that aliens are trying[br]to make contact with us on Earth?

00:16:52.35,00:16:55.25
No, Kitty, this is my potpie.

00:16:55.42,00:16:59.79
No, Kitty, you bad kitty.[br]No, Kitty, this is my potpie!

00:16:59.96,00:17:03.02
Mom! Kitty's being a dildo!

00:17:03.19,00:17:08.72
Then I know a certain kitty-kitty[br]who's sleeping with Mommy tonight.

00:17:09.50,00:17:10.83
What?!

00:17:11.00,00:17:14.84
I have to go home without him,[br]and my parents will kill me.

00:17:15.01,00:17:17.44
- Why don't you get the fat kid?[br]- Why?

00:17:17.61,00:17:21.24
If the fat kid has something[br]implanted in his ass...

00:17:21.41,00:17:24.31
...maybe he's a part[br]of the visitors' plan.

00:17:24.48,00:17:27.75
Use the fat kid as bait[br]to bring them back.

00:17:27.92,00:17:31.75
You're right. Come on, Stan.[br]We have to get Cartman.

00:17:31.92,00:17:34.08
Come on, Stan.

00:17:34.56,00:17:38.19
Hey, wait. When do I get[br]to make sweet love?

00:17:42.70,00:17:45.13
No, Kitty, you can't have any!

00:17:46.00,00:17:50.10
No, Kitty, this is my potpie![br]Bad kitty!

00:17:51.08,00:17:52.84
Excuse me, Kitty.

00:17:53.18,00:17:56.31
- Eric, look who's here.[br]- Good work, Mom!

00:17:56.48,00:17:59.68
- Let's play at the bus stop.[br]- I can't, Mom says...

00:17:59.85,00:18:03.51
That's okay. You need to spend time[br]with your friends.

00:18:03.69,00:18:07.12
- But I don't want to spend time...[br]- Don't be difficult!

00:18:07.29,00:18:12.32
- Now, you go and play in the fun snow.[br]- Goddamn it!

00:18:13.97,00:18:17.66
- I have to get home.[br]- Don't be such a fraidy cat.

00:18:17.84,00:18:21.79
This rope will make sure[br]they can't take you onboard again.

00:18:22.27,00:18:25.17
- This sucks![br]- How come they aren't coming?

00:18:25.34,00:18:28.24
I think we have[br]to signal them somehow.

00:18:28.95,00:18:30.88
Hey, he's like Rudolph.

00:18:31.05,00:18:35.45
All you have to do is fart[br]and the visitors are sure to come.

00:18:35.62,00:18:39.65
Really? I don't think I have[br]to fart anymore tonight.

00:18:39.82,00:18:42.22
- Sure, you do.[br]- Come on, fart!

00:18:42.39,00:18:45.19
- I don't wanna![br]- He can't hold it in forever.

00:18:45.36,00:18:48.42
- Fart, damn you![br]- Okay, that does it!

00:18:48.60,00:18:52.19
Why is it that everything today[br]has involved things...

00:18:52.37,00:18:55.64
...either going in or coming out[br]of my ass?

00:18:55.81,00:18:58.60
I'm sick of it![br]It's completely immature!

00:18:58.78,00:19:00.57
It's happening again.

00:19:03.11,00:19:06.17
- Whoa, look at that.[br]- Now do you believe us?

00:19:06.35,00:19:09.58
You can't scare me.[br]You're making it all up.

00:19:09.75,00:19:13.85
There's an 80-foot satellite dish[br]sticking out of your ass!

00:19:14.06,00:19:16.25
Sure, you guys, whatever.

00:19:18.10,00:19:22.16
Oh, boy, the aliens are going[br]to make first contact.

00:19:22.33,00:19:26.86
Hey! Down here![br]We are ready for your wisdom.

00:19:27.47,00:19:31.93
And you only got 20 minutes[br]before Sanford and Son is on!

00:19:32.11,00:19:36.67
You guys, I am seriously[br]getting pissed off right now.

00:19:36.85,00:19:39.65
I know there's no such thing[br]as aliens!

00:19:41.69,00:19:44.15
Oh, goddamn it!

00:19:44.46,00:19:49.32
What the...? I tell you, there's[br]crazy stuff going on in this town.

00:19:49.49,00:19:52.22
You can say that again, Mr. Garrison.

00:19:52.40,00:19:56.06
Come down here, you stinking aliens!

00:19:58.00,00:20:00.77
Ask them for your little brother back.

00:20:00.94,00:20:05.90
Visitors, you took my brother. He's[br]freckled and looks like a football.

00:20:06.08,00:20:10.28
At first I was happy you took him,[br]but I've learned something:

00:20:10.45,00:20:13.08
Having a little brother is special.

00:20:13.25,00:20:16.69
Heck, I'm just a kid all alone[br]in this crazy world.

00:20:16.85,00:20:20.76
If you can find it in your hearts[br]to give my brother back...

00:20:20.93,00:20:23.45
...it would make my life[br]brighter again.

00:20:23.76,00:20:25.32
That was beautiful.

00:20:25.50,00:20:27.26
- Did it work?[br]- No.

00:20:27.43,00:20:31.27
You scrawny-assed sh * *![br]What the f* * * is wrong with you?

00:20:31.44,00:20:35.30
You must be some kind of f* * *[br]to ignore a crying child!

00:20:35.47,00:20:39.53
You know what you f* * *ing like?[br]You like to f* * *!

00:20:42.11,00:20:44.64
Hey, Wendy, what's a f* * *?

00:20:47.82,00:20:52.88
Ike, jump down! Now![br]For the love of God, Ike, jump!

00:20:53.06,00:20:54.22
Don't hurt me.

00:21:11.01,00:21:14.07
I promise I'll be nice to you[br]from now on.

00:21:14.25,00:21:15.94
Don't kick the baby.

00:21:21.95,00:21:23.75
What are they talking about?

00:21:38.84,00:21:42.74
Ike, do your impersonation[br]of David Caruso's career!

00:21:42.91,00:21:44.67
It's my turn.

00:21:56.92,00:22:00.76
You guys, get me down from here!

00:22:01.83,00:22:04.76
Help! Sons of bitches!

00:22:04.96,00:22:06.90
Dildo!

00:22:07.83,00:22:12.46
- I'm sure glad that's over with.[br]- Boy, am I glad to see you, Ike!

00:22:12.64,00:22:14.63
She's fly at the sky.

00:22:15.04,00:22:18.67
Wait! Where are you going,[br]alien visitors? Come back!

00:22:18.84,00:22:22.37
Where's this amazing thing[br]you were gonna show us?

00:22:22.55,00:22:25.34
It's in the bedroom, ladies.[br]Come on in.

00:22:25.52,00:22:27.98
We can make it in time for dinner.

00:22:28.15,00:22:30.18
- Thanks for helping.[br]- Whatever.

00:22:30.35,00:22:32.85
- Hey, I didn't throw up.[br]- Cool.

00:22:41.37,00:22:42.73
Sorry.

00:22:42.90,00:22:45.33
- Hey, look, a French fry.[br]- Cool.

00:22:45.50,00:22:48.37
- What's that?[br]- It's part of a Cheesy Poof.

00:22:48.54,00:22:51.51
- Hey, what's that?[br]- That's a hamburger.

00:22:51.68,00:22:55.01
- That's from two days ago![br]- What about that?

00:22:55.18,00:22:56.48
I don't know.

00:22:58.18,00:23:01.31
The bus will be here.[br]Cartman's still gone.

00:23:01.49,00:23:03.58
We're running out of friends.

00:23:03.75,00:23:06.62
I wonder what the visitors[br]gave the cows?

00:23:09.53,00:23:14.05
Cows, I got you cornered.[br]Let's see you get away now.

00:23:24.84,00:23:26.07
Hey, Cartman.

00:23:26.24,00:23:29.97
The visitors dropped you off[br]just in time for school.

00:23:30.15,00:23:34.38
- I had a crazy nightmare last night.[br]- Really? What about?

00:23:34.55,00:23:37.08
Well, I was standing out in a field.

00:23:37.25,00:23:40.69
I had this satellite dish[br]sticking out of my butt...

00:23:40.86,00:23:43.35
...and then there were[br]cows and aliens.

00:23:43.53,00:23:47.09
Then I went on the ship,[br]and Scott Baio gave me pinkeye.

00:23:47.26,00:23:49.63
That wasn't a dream.[br]That happened.

00:23:49.80,00:23:54.53
- Right. Why don't I have pinkeye then?[br]- You do have pinkeye!

00:23:54.71,00:23:57.04
Son of a bitch!
