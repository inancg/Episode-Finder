4
00:00:34,618 --> 00:00:36,662
N'kay, kids, as your counselor,

5
00:00:36,703 --> 00:00:42,751
I know it can sometimes be difficult to talk
about subjects like drugs and sex and alcohol, m'kay?

6
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:46,153
So, as you remember, last week I told
you to write down any

7
00:00:46,153 --> 00:00:47,631
difficult questions you had

8
00:00:47,673 --> 00:00:53,387
and put them in this box anonymously so
we could discuss in class, m'kay?

9
00:00:53,554 --> 00:00:56,473
I got a lot o' responses, 
so let's read some aloud.

10
00:00:58,392 --> 00:01:00,769
"Mr. Mackey is gay."

11
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:05,440
Okay kids, that is not funny! Unkay?!

12
00:01:05,607 --> 00:01:08,110
This box is supposed to
 be used for serious questions!

13
00:01:08,151 --> 00:01:12,239
About, about serious issues! M'kay,
let's let's stop the tomfoolery!

14
00:01:12,656 --> 00:01:14,408
M'kay, this looks like a real one here.

15
00:01:14,741 --> 00:01:16,159
"Dear Mr. Mackey,

16
00:01:16,326 --> 00:01:17,786
you are gay."

17
00:01:19,037 --> 00:01:20,539
All right, all right. That's enough, kids.

18
00:01:20,664 --> 00:01:23,208
Let's quiet down and try to be mature, 'kay?

19
00:01:23,375 --> 00:01:24,626
Uh here we go. Okay,

20
00:01:24,877 --> 00:01:27,671
"Mr. Mackey, sometimes my parents hit me,

21
00:01:27,713 --> 00:01:29,464
and you are gay."

22
00:01:30,924 --> 00:01:33,302
Damnit, is there not one serious 
question in here?!

23
00:01:33,635 --> 00:01:36,029
"Mr. Mackey is gay, Mr. Mackey is gay"

24
00:01:36,138 --> 00:01:37,014
Okay, here.

25
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:40,434
I am a boy at South Park Elementary.

26
00:01:40,517 --> 00:01:45,856
Sometimes, when I'm sitting in class,
my penis becomes hard for no reason.

27
00:01:46,023 --> 00:01:47,482
What should I do?

28
00:01:54,198 --> 00:01:56,200
All right kids, all right kids,
that's enough!

29
00:01:59,578 --> 00:02:01,538
If you all can't be serious
about the question box,

30
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:05,083
then we'll just do drug
identification exercises, unkay?!

31
00:02:06,585 --> 00:02:10,506
M'kay, uhh, Jimmy, why don't you come up here
and write down the names of two narcotics?

32
00:02:11,089 --> 00:02:12,758
Uh no, that that's okay, Mr. Mackey.

33
00:02:12,841 --> 00:02:14,593
Jimmy, I'm not asking you, I'm telling you!

34
00:02:14,885 --> 00:02:16,970
Uhhh, just uh uh ahh not right this second, Mr. Mackey.

35
00:02:17,304 --> 00:02:18,764
Well why the hell not?!

36
00:02:26,396 --> 00:02:27,314
He's what...

37
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:29,608
Oh, you do?

38
00:02:30,734 --> 00:02:32,402
R r right now, right now it is?

39
00:02:32,778 --> 00:02:35,113
on'kay, on'kay. Don't worry, Jimmy.

40
00:02:36,406 --> 00:02:38,367
N'kay, uhhh, let's pick someone else.

41
00:02:38,408 --> 00:02:39,993
Eric, why don't you come up here?

42
00:02:40,035 --> 00:02:42,246
Hey, that's bullcrap?!
 How come Jimmy doesn't have to do it?!

43
00:02:42,287 --> 00:02:45,207
Well, because uh, Jimmy is pitching a tent right now.

44
00:02:46,124 --> 00:02:47,251
He's what??

45
00:02:52,256 --> 00:02:53,298
TALENT SHOW THIS FRIDAY
Garand prize 100$

46
00:02:53,465 --> 00:02:55,843
A hundred dollar gift certificate to South Park Mall?

47
00:02:55,884 --> 00:02:57,344
Maybe we should do the talent show.

48
00:02:57,386 --> 00:03:00,180
Well, what's the point? Jimmy always 
wins with his stand-up comedy.

49
00:03:00,305 --> 00:03:01,139
Hey fellas.

50
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:04,101
Dude, didja see, Jimmy? They're giving away
 a hundred dollar first prize for the talent show.

51
00:03:04,226 --> 00:03:07,479
Oh I sure have. I've been working 
on my ruh... ruh,,, routine all year long

52
00:03:07,604 --> 00:03:08,939
I don't know how you do it, dude.

53
00:03:09,022 --> 00:03:10,732
How do you get up in front of that many people?

54
00:03:10,774 --> 00:03:12,442
Well fellas, entertainment is my life.

55
00:03:12,484 --> 00:03:13,777
I love being in front of everyone.

56
00:03:17,573 --> 00:03:18,407
What's the matter?

57
00:03:18,615 --> 00:03:20,284
I gotta guh, I gotta go! See ya fellas.

58
00:03:21,285 --> 00:03:22,035
Excuse me!

59
00:03:28,917 --> 00:03:29,691
It's occupied.

60
00:03:31,044 --> 00:03:32,838
No room at the inn, Virgin Mary.

61
00:03:39,887 --> 00:03:40,929
Hehey Jimmy!

62
00:03:47,186 --> 00:03:49,897
M'boy, did you see that first
prize for the talent show?

63
00:03:49,938 --> 00:03:52,900
Why you must be excited!
You'll probably win like always.

64
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:55,027
Yeah. Yeah, I'm real excited.

65
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:56,862
REAL escited...
for some reason...

66
00:03:57,446 --> 00:03:59,823
Oh, Jesus! What's wrong with me?

67
00:04:01,491 --> 00:04:04,828
Hey, who's droppin' bombs in there?!
How about a courtesy flush?!

68
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,371
Up yours, Butters.

69
00:04:11,585 --> 00:04:13,253
Hey Jimmy, how was school?

70
00:04:13,337 --> 00:04:14,087
Fine, Mom.

71
00:04:14,129 --> 00:04:17,466
Jimmy, we understand you're getting
erections in the classroom.

72
00:04:18,425 --> 00:04:20,093
What? Uh who told you that?

73
00:04:20,177 --> 00:04:21,929
Mr. Mackey, your counselor.

74
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:24,181
Aw J-j-j-j...j-Jesus!

75
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:27,142
Now, Jimmy, it's nothing to be ashamed of.

76
00:04:27,184 --> 00:04:30,604
But we know it's something you might have
a hard time talking about.

77
00:04:30,687 --> 00:04:32,481
Get it? A hard time.

78
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:38,254
So, we took your counselor'sadvice 'nd called 
Doctor Pal to help us all talk about this.

79
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:39,488
Dz-n-Doctor Pal?

80
00:04:39,530 --> 00:04:40,906
Hey Jimmy, I'm Doctor Pal.

81
00:04:40,948 --> 00:04:43,283
That's because I'm a doctor,
but I'm also your pal. Are we cool?

82
00:04:43,659 --> 00:04:44,409
Uh, sure?

83
00:04:44,535 --> 00:04:47,162
A lot of times parents call me in because
I can relate to younger kids.

84
00:04:47,204 --> 00:04:49,122
I'm I'm down, I'm dope, you dig?

85
00:04:49,164 --> 00:04:51,542
Now, I understand you have some
concerns about erections.

86
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:53,210
Oops, can't say erection in front of the parents right.

87
00:04:53,252 --> 00:04:54,878
Oh God, I feel so weird" huh?

88
00:04:55,379 --> 00:04:56,547
Well, a little, yes.

89
00:04:56,588 --> 00:04:58,549
Jimmy, there's nothing weird about random erections.

90
00:04:58,590 --> 00:05:02,511
Almost every boy goes through a phase where
his penisbecomes hard... for no particular reason.

91
00:05:02,553 --> 00:05:03,637
It's just part of grwoing up.

92
00:05:03,846 --> 00:05:06,306
Growing up?
Growing out is more like it.

93
00:05:06,807 --> 00:05:09,768
But I have to make it stop!
The talent show is this F-Friday.

94
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:13,564
Tell you what, Mom and Dad, why don't you skidaddle
for a tick and let us hipsters talk in privo.

95
00:05:13,772 --> 00:05:15,440
A-all right, come on, honey.

96
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:19,236
Jimmy, as you get older your body
goes through a lot of changes.

97
00:05:19,278 --> 00:05:23,198
Certain hormones start to release as your
whole reproductive system begins to awaken,

98
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:25,742
and so, if you like, we can
take off our shirts and kiss.

99
00:05:28,036 --> 00:05:29,288
Ke...c-come again?

100
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:30,369
Oh, hey, nothin', you see?

101
00:05:30,369 --> 00:05:34,418
See, that set you off on a different tangent, got you
thinkin' a different way. That's what Doctor Pal is here to do.

102
00:05:34,459 --> 00:05:36,879
Unless, of course, you think we should
 take off our shirts and kiss.

103
00:05:37,212 --> 00:05:39,298
N-no, I do NOT want to take
off my shirt and kiss.

104
00:05:39,423 --> 00:05:41,925
Well then to hell with you, kid.
You can just deal with your problems on your own.

105
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:50,798
Next up for the talent show:

106
00:05:50,798 --> 00:05:54,521
put your hands together for the incredibly
 talented Jimmy Valmer!

107
00:05:57,441 --> 00:05:58,859
Wow, what a what a great audience.

108
00:05:59,318 --> 00:06:00,819
So apparently Martha Stewart is out of jail.

109
00:06:00,986 --> 00:06:02,779
Have you have you heard about this, have you seen this?

110
00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:04,730
She's very excited to get started on her new show,

111
00:06:04,730 --> 00:06:07,985
"Martha Stewart Living,
with an electronic ankle bracelet."

112
00:06:10,579 --> 00:06:13,290
So it looks like the Vatican has finally chosen a new Pope.

113
00:06:13,707 --> 00:06:15,167
Have you seen this, have you heard about this?

114
00:06:19,129 --> 00:06:21,089
A-a-apparently they're going to call him New Pope,

115
00:06:21,131 --> 00:06:23,550
a-and refer to John Paul as P-Pope Classic.

116
00:06:25,469 --> 00:06:28,305
Uh,.. so it so it looks like Michael Jackson
is having back problem in court.

117
00:06:28,472 --> 00:06:31,850
You know... huh... you uh you know what
they say about b-b-b-b-back problems.

118
00:06:36,188 --> 00:06:37,481
Uh, uh gee, what a terrific audience.

119
00:06:37,523 --> 00:06:38,982
What a fantastic audience.

120
00:06:39,483 --> 00:06:41,485
Don't worry, Jimmy.
We're not laughing with you,

121
00:06:41,652 --> 00:06:42,903
we're laughing AT you.

122
00:06:53,247 --> 00:06:55,290
Lu Lu Lu, I've got some apples,

123
00:06:55,332 --> 00:06:57,292
Lu Lu Lu, you've got some too.

124
00:06:57,376 --> 00:06:59,253
Lu Lu Lu, let's get together,

125
00:06:59,294 --> 00:07:01,588
- I know what we can do, Lu Lu.
- Butters!

126
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:03,090
Oh! Oh hey, Jimmy.

127
00:07:03,632 --> 00:07:05,300
I'm just practicin' for the talent show.

128
00:07:05,384 --> 00:07:07,177
Butters, ah I really need to talk to somebody,

129
00:07:07,219 --> 00:07:09,763
and I think maybe you're the only
person who won't make f-f-fun of me.

130
00:07:09,805 --> 00:07:12,641
Oh Gosh, I'd never make fun of
somebody with a problem.

131
00:07:12,724 --> 00:07:15,936
Butters, do you know what you're supposed
to do when your penis gets hard?

132
00:07:18,021 --> 00:07:19,273
Well sure I do.

133
00:07:19,314 --> 00:07:20,148
Really??

134
00:07:20,357 --> 00:07:22,943
Yes, now sit down, Jimmy,
we should have a little talk.

135
00:07:23,777 --> 00:07:30,089
You see, Jimmy, when a man's penis becomes hard,
the man puts it into a lady. Into her "vagiiina."

136
00:07:30,409 --> 00:07:34,037
Then, the hard penis sneezes
milk inside the lady's tummy,

137
00:07:34,079 --> 00:07:37,416
and after it's all done sneezin' milk. 
The penis stops bein' hard,

138
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:39,626
and the man loses interest in the lady.

139
00:07:41,003 --> 00:07:45,211
So, when your penis becomes hard,
you're supposed to put in in a lady's vagina.

140
00:07:45,632 --> 00:07:47,009
And then it stops being hard?

141
00:07:47,134 --> 00:07:48,260
That's right, Jimmy.

142
00:07:48,385 --> 00:07:50,137
But where am I going to find a lady to stick my penis in?

143
00:07:50,179 --> 00:07:51,847
The talent show is this Friday.

144
00:07:54,892 --> 00:07:56,351
Talk to you, Bertha.

145
00:07:56,393 --> 00:07:57,936
Okay, see you later, Jessie.

146
00:07:59,354 --> 00:08:00,397
Hey Bertha.

147
00:08:00,689 --> 00:08:02,858
Oh, hey Jimmy.
What's goin' on?

148
00:08:02,941 --> 00:08:06,320
Well Bertha, I was wondering if I could
stick my penis in your vagina?

149
00:08:06,987 --> 00:08:08,405
What?? No way!

150
00:08:08,614 --> 00:08:10,407
But the talent show is tomorrow!

151
00:08:10,908 --> 00:08:11,533
Jerk!

152
00:08:12,201 --> 00:08:14,161
Jimmy, Jimmy, what the hell are you doing, man?

153
00:08:14,203 --> 00:08:15,704
I'm trying to get laid. What's it look like?

154
00:08:15,746 --> 00:08:19,082
Dude, you don't just go up to a girl
and ask her if you can stick your penis in her vagina.

155
00:08:19,124 --> 00:08:21,752
Ye-you have to ask her on a date, take
her out for some Italian food.

156
00:08:21,877 --> 00:08:23,462
Wow, seems like you know a lot
about this stuff, Eric.

157
00:08:23,504 --> 00:08:24,671
Have you gotten laid before?

158
00:08:24,713 --> 00:08:26,006
Sure, lots of times.

159
00:08:26,048 --> 00:08:28,050
I've been laid, like, five thousand times.

160
00:08:28,091 --> 00:08:29,218
Well, wha-what do I do?

161
00:08:29,259 --> 00:08:31,053
I told you: a date and then Italian food.

162
00:08:31,094 --> 00:08:32,721
And then you gotta make her
thnk you're a good listener.

163
00:08:32,763 --> 00:08:36,642
Eric, I can't tell you why, but it's very
important that I score to-night!

164
00:08:36,683 --> 00:08:39,520
Can you come on the date and help me?
You're like a white... Hitch.

165
00:08:39,603 --> 00:08:41,813
Why sure, they do this all
the time in movies and TV shows.

166
00:08:41,855 --> 00:08:43,857
You go on the date and wear an earpiece,

167
00:08:43,941 --> 00:08:46,860
and I'll be nearby, secretly telling
you all the right things to say.

168
00:08:46,902 --> 00:08:48,362
Wow! Thanks, Eric.

169
00:08:51,073 --> 00:08:53,909
Shawna honey, I think your little date is here.

170
00:08:54,117 --> 00:08:55,369
Okay, Mom.

171
00:08:57,329 --> 00:08:58,247
Hey Shawna.

172
00:08:58,872 --> 00:08:59,790
Hi Jimmy.

173
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:02,543
Okay Jimmy.
First off, tell her how good she looks.

174
00:09:02,584 --> 00:09:04,461
Wow, Shawna, you look fantastic.

175
00:09:04,503 --> 00:09:06,463
Thanks, Jimmy. Where are we going?

176
00:09:06,505 --> 00:09:09,925
We're going to an authentic Italian restaurant,
Buca de Fagghecini.

177
00:09:13,512 --> 00:09:17,558
Welcome to Buca de Fagghecini for
the authentico experience Italiano.

178
00:09:17,599 --> 00:09:19,059
My name is Roma.

179
00:09:19,101 --> 00:09:21,812
Can I start you out with some lotsa
pasta macaroni minis?

180
00:09:21,895 --> 00:09:24,857
Uh, I think we're gonna try your authentic
pizzareli casserona poppers.

181
00:09:24,982 --> 00:09:25,941
Right away.

182
00:09:26,567 --> 00:09:29,027
You know that girl Sally Rauman at our school?

183
00:09:29,069 --> 00:09:30,529
I can't stand her.

184
00:09:30,654 --> 00:09:31,613
Jimmy! Jimmy!

185
00:09:31,822 --> 00:09:34,752
Jimmy, even though what she's saying now
isn't interesting at all, you say:

186
00:09:34,752 --> 00:09:37,411
"Wow, that is very interesting. Please tell me more."

187
00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:40,205
Wow, that is very interesting. Please tell me more.

188
00:09:40,247 --> 00:09:41,206
Really?

189
00:09:41,248 --> 00:09:44,276
Well, Kelligan bought the same purse
and I was like, "No WAY do I want it now!"

190
00:09:44,376 --> 00:09:46,628
because who wants a purse that both their
best friends have, right? And so-

191
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:48,213
All right, when she stops yappin' again,

192
00:09:48,255 --> 00:09:51,175
say: "Wow, I've never thought
of it that way before, but you're right."

193
00:09:51,383 --> 00:09:53,927
-I guess that's why I figured,
"Who needs friends like that?"

194
00:09:53,969 --> 00:09:56,471
Wow, I've never thought of it
that way before, but you're right.

195
00:09:56,513 --> 00:09:57,681
It's like I told Debbie:

196
00:09:57,723 --> 00:09:59,016
"If you're gonna go out with my friends-"

197
00:09:59,057 --> 00:10:00,851
All right Jimmy,
when she finally shuts her trap again,

198
00:10:00,893 --> 00:10:02,519
I want you to repeat whatever she said,

199
00:10:02,561 --> 00:10:05,147
and then follow it with: "Wow, how insightful."

200
00:10:05,397 --> 00:10:07,900
"And so if you're gonna be that way,
I don't need to be your friend."

201
00:10:07,983 --> 00:10:11,403
"if you're gonna be that way, I don't need
to be your friend." Wow, how insightful.

202
00:10:11,445 --> 00:10:14,114
You know, Jimmy, you are a great listener.

203
00:10:14,281 --> 00:10:14,907
Really?

204
00:10:14,948 --> 00:10:18,619
Yeah. I mean, no other boys really
communicate like you do.

205
00:10:18,619 --> 00:10:20,120
Oh, I'm so glad you think so, Shawna,

206
00:10:20,204 --> 00:10:22,372
because I really wanna stick
my penis in your vagina.

207
00:10:22,748 --> 00:10:23,999
Yes, nice, Jimmy, very nice.

208
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:26,919
...What??? I'm not doing that!

209
00:10:27,044 --> 00:10:29,129
But the talent show is tomorrow night!

210
00:10:29,171 --> 00:10:29,821
Creep!

211
00:10:37,846 --> 00:10:42,684
Welcome students and parents to
the annual South Park Elementary Talent Show!

212
00:10:45,062 --> 00:10:47,648
We have a lot of little talneted performers to get through,

213
00:10:47,689 --> 00:10:50,609
so the quicker you shut up,
the quicker this will be over!

214
00:10:52,903 --> 00:10:56,240
Okay, first up we have Billy Turner,
from the third grade,

215
00:10:56,281 --> 00:10:59,117
who will be doing an alto sax solo.

216
00:11:20,764 --> 00:11:22,850
Jimmy? Jimmy Valmer?

217
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:26,603
Oh... Hi, Officer B-b-barbrady.

218
00:11:26,645 --> 00:11:30,065
Jimmy, what are you doing here?
The talent show is inside.

219
00:11:30,274 --> 00:11:32,359
I'm... not gonna perform in the talent show.

220
00:11:33,861 --> 00:11:35,112
Not perform?

221
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:39,032
But Jimmy, you love talent shows.
Everyone in town knows that.

222
00:11:39,241 --> 00:11:41,827
I just c-can't risk getting up
in front of everyone.

223
00:11:42,536 --> 00:11:43,495
Why?

224
00:11:43,829 --> 00:11:46,331
All right! I I keep getting
an erection for no reason! Okay!

225
00:11:46,373 --> 00:11:49,209
But I can't get any of the girls
here to let me... do it to them.

226
00:11:49,251 --> 00:11:52,588
Well of course not, Jimmy.
Little girls don't wanna have sex.

227
00:11:52,629 --> 00:11:54,756
Then why does God make it so
that my penis gets hard

228
00:11:54,798 --> 00:11:57,301
...if girls don't wanna
have it in their vaginas?

229
00:11:57,551 --> 00:11:58,886
It's like a cruel joke.

230
00:11:58,927 --> 00:12:05,225
Well, Jimmy, the girls here are young and pure.
They're not like the ladies down at Colfax Point.

231
00:12:05,767 --> 00:12:07,352
...Colfax Point?

232
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:10,439
Well yeah, those women will have sex with anybody.

233
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:11,356
Really?

234
00:12:11,565 --> 00:12:14,359
M-maybe I can catch the bus 
...and get down there before the talent show ends.

235
00:12:14,443 --> 00:12:15,777
Th-thanks, Officer Barbrady!

236
00:12:16,028 --> 00:12:17,571
You're welcome, Jim.

237
00:12:20,866 --> 00:12:21,491
Wait...

238
00:12:22,326 --> 00:12:24,244
Colfax Point...

239
00:12:24,494 --> 00:12:28,081
Pimps and hos and tricks in rows

240
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:32,503
Women walk the street with corns
on their feets

241
00:12:32,836 --> 00:12:36,507
Broken dreams
and no ice creams

242
00:12:36,757 --> 00:12:38,258
You lookin' for a date?

243
00:12:39,092 --> 00:12:40,677
Hello? Hello?

244
00:12:40,969 --> 00:12:43,805
I need to put my ...p-penis
in a woman's vagina. Any takers?

245
00:12:44,264 --> 00:12:45,724
Excuse me, ma'am. What's your name?

246
00:12:45,766 --> 00:12:47,392
They call me Nut Gobbler.

247
00:12:47,434 --> 00:12:49,353
Well, Nut Gobbler, I need to get laid.

248
00:12:51,855 --> 00:12:55,275
I have a raging hard-on that just won't quit,
and the talent show has already started.

249
00:12:56,276 --> 00:12:57,236
You a cop?

250
00:12:57,528 --> 00:12:59,279
No. Actually, I'm a stand-up comic.

251
00:12:59,404 --> 00:13:00,447
You got money?

252
00:13:00,614 --> 00:13:01,448
Sure do.

253
00:13:01,698 --> 00:13:03,659
All right, you got a place to go?

254
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:05,661
Sure. I know the p-perfect place.

255
00:13:06,662 --> 00:13:10,165
Welcome to Buca de Fagghecini for
the authentic experienso Italiano.

256
00:13:10,207 --> 00:13:13,460
My name is Roma, and
Oh, it's so nice to see you again, Mr. Valmer.

257
00:13:13,585 --> 00:13:16,421
Hey, can it, jackass! I just don't want them
to know I was here with a different girl.

258
00:13:16,463 --> 00:13:17,923
Oh right, pardone, segnore.

259
00:13:17,965 --> 00:13:20,384
I'll come back with some
garlic bread mediterraneane.

260
00:13:21,385 --> 00:13:23,095
What are we doin' anyway?

261
00:13:23,095 --> 00:13:25,472
This is authentic Italian
food straight from S-Sicily.

262
00:13:25,514 --> 00:13:27,266
You should try the Lotsa Mozzarella Pizza Roll.

263
00:13:27,307 --> 00:13:30,853
I can't eat too much, I'lve got
an infected urinary tract.

264
00:13:30,894 --> 00:13:32,688
I've been pissin' blood for a week.

265
00:13:32,729 --> 00:13:35,649
Oh, uh, wow, that is very interesting.
Please tell me more.

266
00:13:37,484 --> 00:13:39,111
Well, that's it, I just pissed blood!

267
00:13:39,152 --> 00:13:41,572
So I have to stick a tampon up my peehole.

268
00:13:43,115 --> 00:13:45,617
Wow. You know, I've never thought of
it that way before, but you're right.

269
00:13:45,659 --> 00:13:48,036
If you're pissing blood, you can shuve
a tampon up your peehole.

270
00:13:48,328 --> 00:13:49,997
You are very insightful.
Please tell me more.

271
00:13:50,038 --> 00:13:52,541
Look, kid, what are you doin'?!
You wanna get laid or not?

272
00:13:52,583 --> 00:13:53,876
Well of couse I wanna get laid.

273
00:13:53,959 --> 00:13:56,670
That's why I'm taking you to this ...fancy place
and pretending to be interested in what you have to say..

274
00:13:56,753 --> 00:13:57,880
Kid, I'm a hooker.

275
00:13:57,921 --> 00:14:00,424
You don't have to take me to dinner
OR be nice to me.

276
00:14:00,465 --> 00:14:01,967
What? Fo, for real?

277
00:14:02,092 --> 00:14:04,636
You paid me, so you get to do me. It's that simple.

278
00:14:04,845 --> 00:14:07,097
Well jumpin' Jesus,
what are we wasting our time here for then?

279
00:14:07,222 --> 00:14:09,933
The talent show is happening right now!
Let's get to r-r-rammin'!

280
00:14:09,975 --> 00:14:11,935
What are you doin', ho?! Havin' dinner?!

281
00:14:11,977 --> 00:14:13,437
You're supposed to be workin' for me!

282
00:14:13,478 --> 00:14:15,856
It's where the trick wanted to go, you bastard!

283
00:14:15,898 --> 00:14:19,109
Trick?! I ain't stupid! Ain't no trick
gonna take you out to dinner!

284
00:14:19,151 --> 00:14:21,361
This PIMP is tryin' to steal you away from me!

285
00:14:21,612 --> 00:14:22,988
This is MY ho!

286
00:14:23,071 --> 00:14:24,573
I beg to differ with you, sir.

287
00:14:24,615 --> 00:14:26,950
I paid for her and took her out to dinner. 
She's my ho!

288
00:14:26,992 --> 00:14:28,202
Uh Jesus.

289
00:14:28,243 --> 00:14:29,661
You got a problem, bitch?!

290
00:14:29,703 --> 00:14:31,371
Yes, I do have a problem, as a matter of fact!

291
00:14:31,413 --> 00:14:32,706
I've spent all my money on this ho,

292
00:14:32,748 --> 00:14:34,041
and she's now my only shot at getting laid,

293
00:14:34,208 --> 00:14:35,918
and the talent show is only a couple
of hours from being over.

294
00:14:35,959 --> 00:14:37,544
You're comin' home right now!

295
00:14:38,170 --> 00:14:39,963
Let go of my hair, you son of a bitch!

296
00:14:40,005 --> 00:14:41,423
Sir, sir, that is my ho!

297
00:14:41,465 --> 00:14:43,091
I'm gonna kick your ass, ho!

298
00:14:43,133 --> 00:14:44,384
Sir, sir!

299
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:00,859
Son of a ...b-bitch!

300
00:15:01,777 --> 00:15:02,611
Taxi!

301
00:15:04,279 --> 00:15:05,948
Follow that pimp and ho!

302
00:15:09,326 --> 00:15:10,619
Where are you taking me?!

303
00:15:10,661 --> 00:15:11,995
I'm gonna kill you, ho!

304
00:15:12,037 --> 00:15:14,289
No! Please! Q Money! I'm sorry!

305
00:15:14,331 --> 00:15:15,874
You're already dead, ho!

306
00:15:17,209 --> 00:15:21,505
Sir! I paid for that lady, and by taking her,
you are no better than a common th-thief!

307
00:15:21,547 --> 00:15:22,589
Fuck you, punk!

308
00:15:28,136 --> 00:15:30,097
Nut Gobbler, grab onto my crutch!

309
00:15:34,142 --> 00:15:36,019
Get your ass back in here, ho!

310
00:15:36,937 --> 00:15:38,188
I got you, Nut Gobbler!

311
00:15:43,151 --> 00:15:44,903
No no nono no,

312
00:15:45,487 --> 00:15:47,823
I'm not gonna be in the talent show.

313
00:15:47,865 --> 00:15:50,033
Oh no no no no no.

314
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:52,703
I'll never be in your faggy talent show.

315
00:15:55,038 --> 00:15:58,959
Okay, that was the Goth kids with
"Talent Shows Are For Fags"

316
00:15:59,418 --> 00:16:01,086
That was killer. We showed them.

317
00:16:01,128 --> 00:16:02,504
Yeah, I hope we win.

318
00:16:05,966 --> 00:16:06,884
Come on, ho!

319
00:16:11,638 --> 00:16:12,639
Look out!

320
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:31,325
Stay on him! I'm not giving up!

321
00:16:37,956 --> 00:16:40,918
Okay, very nice, Clark and Laura. Very nice.

322
00:16:41,210 --> 00:16:45,214
Our next act is Butters, who will be singing a song

323
00:16:45,881 --> 00:16:47,049
There's our boy.

324
00:16:51,762 --> 00:16:53,639
Lu lu lu, I'vw got some...

325
00:16:54,765 --> 00:16:55,599
some... uh,

326
00:16:56,683 --> 00:16:58,435
some uh... some,

327
00:17:01,313 --> 00:17:02,147
Oh no!

328
00:17:03,607 --> 00:17:05,442
No no noho noo!

329
00:17:06,026 --> 00:17:08,862
Okay, thank you Butters,
very nice, short and sweet.

330
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:13,951
Goddamn, this pimp just won't give up!

331
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:15,661
Get close to him!

332
00:17:22,459 --> 00:17:23,627
How much do I owe you?

333
00:17:24,795 --> 00:17:26,755
6 dollars and 24 cents.

334
00:17:28,465 --> 00:17:30,050
C-can I just get 2 back, please?

335
00:17:30,092 --> 00:17:31,426
Oh, thank you very much.

336
00:17:32,511 --> 00:17:33,762
There you go.
Have a good 'n.

337
00:17:33,804 --> 00:17:34,555
Thank you.

338
00:17:44,106 --> 00:17:45,899
You're gonna pay for this, bitch!

339
00:17:46,066 --> 00:17:47,943
No! Heelllp!!

340
00:17:53,407 --> 00:17:55,200
Don't worry, Nut Gobbler!
I'm coming!

341
00:17:58,745 --> 00:18:00,038
Oh Jesus, not now.

342
00:18:00,789 --> 00:18:02,166
Oh boy, this is embarassing.

343
00:18:03,375 --> 00:18:05,669
And now we have Eric Cartman,

344
00:18:05,711 --> 00:18:09,548
who will be doing select
readings from the movie, Scarface.

345
00:18:14,052 --> 00:18:15,179
D'you know what you are?

346
00:18:15,470 --> 00:18:17,723
You're all a bunch of fucking cock roaches!

347
00:18:17,764 --> 00:18:19,266
You need people like me!

348
00:18:19,558 --> 00:18:22,227
You need people like me so you
can point your fucking finger

349
00:18:22,269 --> 00:18:23,812
and say "That's the bad guy!"

350
00:18:23,854 --> 00:18:25,772
Well say goodnight to the bad guy!!

351
00:18:26,231 --> 00:18:27,816
That's my little boy.

352
00:18:29,026 --> 00:18:30,903
Please, Q Money!
Don't do this!

353
00:18:30,944 --> 00:18:32,821
I told you never to turn on me, ho!

354
00:18:33,322 --> 00:18:35,240
Hey, j-j-jackass!

355
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:39,036
I'm sorry I resorted to calling
you jackass just now,

356
00:18:39,077 --> 00:18:40,496
but I'm very upset!

357
00:18:40,537 --> 00:18:44,333
And what are you gonna do, huh?!
I've got four feet on you AND a gun!

358
00:18:44,374 --> 00:18:45,501
What do you have?!

359
00:18:45,542 --> 00:18:46,376
What do I have?

360
00:18:46,543 --> 00:18:47,711
The weapon of comedy.

361
00:18:48,086 --> 00:18:50,464
So apparently the Chinese and
the Japanese aren't getting along lately.

362
00:18:50,506 --> 00:18:52,174
Have you seen this?
Have you heard about this?

363
00:18:52,674 --> 00:18:53,300
What?!

364
00:18:53,342 --> 00:18:56,803
I'll tell you one thing: their food hasn't
been getting along with my stomach for years.

365
00:18:58,514 --> 00:18:59,765
That's pretty good.

366
00:18:59,890 --> 00:19:02,184
Martha Stewart is out of jail.
Have you seen this? Have you heard about this?

367
00:19:04,102 --> 00:19:05,812
Oh yeah. That's right, she is.

368
00:19:05,854 --> 00:19:08,357
She's apparently gotten real good
with baking cakes with keys in them.

369
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:13,320
Serves you right, you son of a bitch!

370
00:19:13,362 --> 00:19:14,947
Nice teamwork, Nut Gobbler.

371
00:19:14,988 --> 00:19:17,407
I can't believe you chased me all this way.

372
00:19:18,408 --> 00:19:20,118
You, you really care about me.

373
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:22,120
Not really. You're just a hooker,
and I need to get laid.

374
00:19:22,162 --> 00:19:23,622
The talent show could be over any minute.

375
00:19:23,664 --> 00:19:25,249
That's good enough for me.

376
00:19:25,874 --> 00:19:27,376
Take me to bed.

377
00:20:24,933 --> 00:20:27,477
Okay, very nice, Ike, thank you.

378
00:20:28,312 --> 00:20:31,690
All right, children, it looks
like we have no more contestants,

379
00:20:31,732 --> 00:20:34,067
which means, the Talent Show is over!

380
00:20:35,944 --> 00:20:37,196
Mr. Mackey, it's over.

381
00:20:37,446 --> 00:20:38,822
Oh oh oh, right.

382
00:20:38,989 --> 00:20:43,535
Now we will tally up the judges' scores
and find out which act they hated the least.

383
00:20:43,577 --> 00:20:45,162
Hold everything!

384
00:20:56,256 --> 00:20:58,926
Mrs. Garrison, if you don't mind,
I'll be taking that microphone..

385
00:20:59,009 --> 00:21:02,763
Okay, let's put our hands
together for Jimmy Valmer.

386
00:21:05,724 --> 00:21:06,975
Wow, what a terrific audience.

387
00:21:07,184 --> 00:21:09,394
So apparently it's been exactly
two years since the fall of Baghdad.

388
00:21:09,436 --> 00:21:10,729
Have you seen this?
Have you heard about this?

389
00:21:10,812 --> 00:21:14,441
Just as B-Bush predicted, Baghdad fell,
Iraq fell, Saddam fell.

390
00:21:14,525 --> 00:21:17,027
The only thing that didn't fall was
...the price of gas.

391
00:21:18,737 --> 00:21:20,697
I just read in the paper that China's protesting Japan.

392
00:21:20,781 --> 00:21:22,115
Have you seen this?
Have you heard about this?

393
00:21:22,199 --> 00:21:24,034
Yeah, I guess in China you don't get to-

394
00:21:27,287 --> 00:21:28,622
You've gotta be kidding me.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
