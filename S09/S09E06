4
00:00:36,245 --> 00:00:38,080
Dude, where is she? We can't wait.

5
00:00:38,163 --> 00:00:39,957
God, this is gonna be sooo yummy.

6
00:00:40,082 --> 00:00:43,877
Stan, you said your mom was bringing
KFC home for dinner! Now is she or isn't she?!

7
00:00:44,086 --> 00:00:44,962
Hi boys.

8
00:00:45,128 --> 00:00:46,255
- Mom!
- She's here!

9
00:00:46,296 --> 00:00:47,422
She's got Colonel!

10
00:00:47,464 --> 00:00:48,715
- I want some!
- I want a breast!

11
00:00:48,715 --> 00:00:50,509
Some extra-crispy thighs, extra crispy?

12
00:00:50,551 --> 00:00:51,899
Uuh uh uh, not so fast.

13
00:00:51,899 --> 00:00:55,222
You boys can help bring in the other groceries
 in the car, then have your chicken.

14
00:00:56,014 --> 00:00:57,599
But Mom, we've been waiting for hours!

15
00:00:57,641 --> 00:00:59,101
It won't take a minute.

16
00:01:00,018 --> 00:01:02,855
Come on guys. If we all help out,
 we can do it super-fast.

17
00:01:02,938 --> 00:01:04,398
- All right.
- Let's go.

18
00:01:04,439 --> 00:01:06,108
Oh my God, that smells good.

19
00:01:17,494 --> 00:01:18,954
Okay, this is everything, mom.

20
00:01:21,123 --> 00:01:22,374
All right, let's eat Colonel!

21
00:01:22,499 --> 00:01:23,333
Oh boy!

22
00:01:27,421 --> 00:01:30,132
Cartman, you ate the skin off of every piece of chicken!

23
00:01:30,215 --> 00:01:31,717
Well, I saved you all the chicken part.

24
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:33,510
The skin's the best part...

25
00:01:33,552 --> 00:01:36,430
Well, I gotta go home, guys.
I'm gonna sit on the toilet and read comic books.

26
00:01:36,471 --> 00:01:37,723
See you at the bus stop tomorrow.

27
00:01:48,775 --> 00:01:50,235
I can't believe that fat asshole!

28
00:01:50,277 --> 00:01:52,446
You can't believe it??
 He does this shit all the time!

29
00:01:52,487 --> 00:01:53,947
Well this time he's gone too far.

30
00:01:55,073 --> 00:01:56,575
Why do we even hang out with him, anyway?

31
00:01:56,658 --> 00:01:58,869
Hello?? I've been saying this for years!

32
00:01:58,911 --> 00:02:01,371
Well it's not like we're nice to him.
 I mean, we rip on him all the time!

33
00:02:01,413 --> 00:02:03,081
Yes, but he thrives on that.

34
00:02:03,123 --> 00:02:04,583
All right. Then let's just ignore him.

35
00:02:04,625 --> 00:02:07,503
From now on, let's not talk to him,
 let's not even acknowledge him.

36
00:02:08,253 --> 00:02:09,296
That sounds great!

37
00:02:09,838 --> 00:02:11,381
Hey fags, what's going on?

38
00:02:15,802 --> 00:02:19,181
Dude, I was on the toilet all night from
 that chicken. I thought I was gonna die.

39
00:02:20,432 --> 00:02:21,934
Do any of you guys have
 milk money I can borrow?

40
00:02:21,975 --> 00:02:22,935
I think I have extra.

41
00:02:22,976 --> 00:02:25,437
Oh wow, a Jew asking for money!
There's a new one.

42
00:02:27,397 --> 00:02:29,566
Yuh, you guys know why Jews have glassy eyes?

43
00:02:29,608 --> 00:02:30,859
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

44
00:02:31,818 --> 00:02:34,279
Dude, Stan, yuh you know why
 Jews have glassy eyes?

45
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:35,364
Like Kyle?

46
00:02:36,949 --> 00:02:39,993
K-Kenny, you see that chick on
 the news that had her left titty cut off?

47
00:02:40,077 --> 00:02:40,953
Kenny...?

48
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:42,162
Kenny!?

49
00:02:45,415 --> 00:02:47,376
Stan? Stan, it's me, Eric!

50
00:02:47,793 --> 00:02:50,295
Eh... Kenny. Kenny, you want fifty cents?

51
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:53,131
Dude, look at me, Kyle, I'm right here!

52
00:02:59,429 --> 00:03:00,055
Wha...?

53
00:03:00,514 --> 00:03:01,348
How did...?

54
00:03:02,057 --> 00:03:04,226
Like they couldn't see or hear me.

55
00:03:04,977 --> 00:03:06,645
It's almost as if I were...

56
00:03:08,689 --> 00:03:09,731
dead.

57
00:03:10,649 --> 00:03:11,275
No.

58
00:03:11,733 --> 00:03:12,901
No, I can't be dead.

59
00:03:13,026 --> 00:03:14,486
I can't be dead!!

60
00:03:15,737 --> 00:03:19,199
All right, ma'am. We've got your new toilet installed 
and we'll haul away the old one away for ya.

61
00:03:19,241 --> 00:03:22,536
Oh, you've been so helpful, I uh,
just don't know how to thank you.

62
00:03:23,245 --> 00:03:24,913
I could think of a few ways.

63
00:03:31,295 --> 00:03:31,795
No!

64
00:03:32,087 --> 00:03:32,921
Noooo!!!

65
00:03:33,338 --> 00:03:34,798
What happened? Did they say?

66
00:03:35,048 --> 00:03:39,845
Apparently there was so much chicken skin
 in the system it just ruptured the insides.

67
00:03:39,928 --> 00:03:41,597
Aww, that's tragic.

68
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:44,176
Oh my God, this can't be happening!

69
00:03:46,894 --> 00:03:49,526
Mom? Mom's crying?
Oh God, it is true!

70
00:03:57,988 --> 00:03:59,239
Oh, it's not fair!

71
00:03:59,406 --> 00:04:00,282
Why???

72
00:04:00,324 --> 00:04:01,366
WHY???

73
00:04:07,497 --> 00:04:09,374
Hey fellas, w-where is Cartman?

74
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:10,918
Cartman isn't our friend anymor

75
00:04:11,001 --> 00:04:12,044
We're ignoring him.

76
00:04:12,461 --> 00:04:13,795
Ignoring him? How come?

77
00:04:13,837 --> 00:04:16,840
Beause he's a fat racist self-centered 
intolerant manipulating sociopath!

78
00:04:17,174 --> 00:04:17,799
Oh yeah.

79
00:04:17,841 --> 00:04:20,010
Hey, I hate Cartman 
Can I ignore him with you?

80
00:04:20,052 --> 00:04:21,929
- Yeah.
- Me too. - Yeah, screw him! Yeah.

81
00:04:22,012 --> 00:04:24,097
I never realized ignoring him was an option.

82
00:04:24,556 --> 00:04:26,433
Guys! Guys?

83
00:04:26,725 --> 00:04:27,935
Can anybody hear me?

84
00:04:27,976 --> 00:04:28,810
You guys??

85
00:04:28,894 --> 00:04:30,604
Token, Token, I'm here!

86
00:04:31,021 --> 00:04:33,106
Hello! Hello! Hello!

87
00:04:33,315 --> 00:04:36,235
Clyde, can't you feel me?
Feel me, Clyde!

88
00:04:36,818 --> 00:04:38,904
Jimmy! Jimmy, it's me, Eric!

89
00:04:40,364 --> 00:04:43,367
Jimmy! Can't you feel your hair move?! That's me!

90
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:47,999
They don't even know yet,
that one of their best friends is dead.

91
00:04:48,622 --> 00:04:51,421
Dead and... still wandering
 the earth a lost soul.

92
00:05:03,971 --> 00:05:05,389
What is that kid doing?

93
00:05:05,722 --> 00:05:07,391
I don't know, just ignore him.

94
00:05:21,655 --> 00:05:23,615
Lu lu lu, I've got some apples.

95
00:05:23,657 --> 00:05:25,075
Lu lu lu, yuu've got some too-

96
00:05:25,117 --> 00:05:26,577
What did I do to deserve this?!

97
00:05:26,702 --> 00:05:28,495
How can my own God forsake me?!

98
00:05:29,121 --> 00:05:31,623
Am I doomed to wander
 the Earth alone for all eternity?!

99
00:05:32,082 --> 00:05:33,083
Hey Eric!

100
00:05:36,003 --> 00:05:37,045
...What did you say?

101
00:05:38,547 --> 00:05:40,215
Huh I just said, "Hey Eric!"

102
00:05:40,757 --> 00:05:41,592
Butters...

103
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:43,385
Butters! You can see me??

104
00:05:43,468 --> 00:05:44,928
Well, sure I can see you.

105
00:05:45,095 --> 00:05:46,680
Oh my God, and you can hear me??

106
00:05:46,722 --> 00:05:49,850
Well, jeez Eric, why wouldn't I be able to hear you?

107
00:05:50,142 --> 00:05:51,059
Because, Butters,

108
00:05:51,685 --> 00:05:53,061
I'm... dead.

109
00:05:57,024 --> 00:05:57,649
Butters!

110
00:05:58,066 --> 00:05:59,318
Butters, I just want to talk to you!

111
00:05:59,776 --> 00:06:01,570
You died?? How??

112
00:06:01,612 --> 00:06:03,906
I ate a bunch of chicken skin and it blew out my insides.

113
00:06:04,198 --> 00:06:06,283
But if you're d-dead, how come I can see you?

114
00:06:06,325 --> 00:06:07,951
I don't know, but you're the only one who can.

115
00:06:12,039 --> 00:06:14,124
Butters! Butters, Goddamnit, I need your help!

116
00:06:19,755 --> 00:06:21,632
Butters, what on earth are you doing??

117
00:06:21,673 --> 00:06:25,135
Well I think... I'm like the kid in that movie!
 I-I'm seeing dead people!

118
00:06:25,177 --> 00:06:26,220
Dead people?

119
00:06:26,595 --> 00:06:27,846
Who's seeing dead people?

120
00:06:28,013 --> 00:06:29,814
Me! I saw a ghost!

121
00:06:30,557 --> 00:06:33,477
Now, Butters, there's no such thing as ghosts.

122
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:36,271
But I saw him!
 Just as plain as I'm seein' you right now!

123
00:06:36,313 --> 00:06:38,565
Butters, these things happen all the time.

124
00:06:38,607 --> 00:06:42,152
You've got a very active little brain 
and your mind was just playing tricks on you.

125
00:06:42,277 --> 00:06:43,320
Ruh, really?

126
00:06:43,529 --> 00:06:44,363
Yeess.

127
00:06:44,738 --> 00:06:45,155
So...

128
00:06:45,614 --> 00:06:48,825
so it was just... it was...
just my ima... magination then?

129
00:06:48,867 --> 00:06:49,785
That's right.

130
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:52,913
There's no reason to be afraid of things that aren't real.

131
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:56,597
There's plenty of real things to be scared of.
Like super-AIDS.

132
00:06:57,084 --> 00:06:58,335
Huh s-s-super-AIDS?

133
00:06:58,377 --> 00:07:01,296
That's right. A new form of AIDS
 which is resistant to drugs.

134
00:07:01,338 --> 00:07:04,466
Just one teaspoon of super-AIDS in your butt 
and you're dead in three years.

135
00:07:05,259 --> 00:07:06,093
Oh Jesus.

136
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:10,117
So now you feel better?
Ghosts don't exist and there's nothing to be afraid of.

137
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:11,890
Except the super-AIDS.

138
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:23,193
Nuh-nothing to be scared of. 
Jus, just some lightning and thunder.

139
00:07:25,571 --> 00:07:26,655
Gah! Wasn't nothin' neither.

140
00:07:26,822 --> 00:07:27,865
J-just a muhouse.

141
00:07:28,782 --> 00:07:29,408
Butters...

142
00:07:31,702 --> 00:07:32,995
Butters, you have to help me!

143
00:07:33,161 --> 00:07:34,621
Go away! You aren't real!

144
00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:36,290
All right, Butters, you leave me no choice.

145
00:07:41,962 --> 00:07:43,422
Butters, what is going on?!

146
00:07:43,547 --> 00:07:45,215
Well it's all.. Well he was...

147
00:07:46,133 --> 00:07:46,884
Nothin'

148
00:07:47,134 --> 00:07:48,302
I I just had a nightmare.

149
00:07:48,343 --> 00:07:51,054
Well you'd better stop having nightmares
 or eles you're gonna be grounded!

150
00:07:51,138 --> 00:07:52,389
Y yes, yes sir.

151
00:07:59,646 --> 00:08:00,272
Butters!

152
00:08:03,025 --> 00:08:04,735
Butters, Goddamnit, I'm not in your imagination!

153
00:08:04,776 --> 00:08:06,278
I'm dead and for some reason you can see me!

154
00:08:06,361 --> 00:08:07,571
But I don't want to see you!

155
00:08:07,613 --> 00:08:09,489
Get a hold of yourself!
 I'm the one who died!

156
00:08:10,157 --> 00:08:12,743
And for some reason, 
my spirit is trapped here on Earth.

157
00:08:12,910 --> 00:08:14,494
I can't find the passage to Heaven.

158
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:18,499
Well... how do you know you're supposed to go to Heaven?

159
00:08:18,582 --> 00:08:19,416
What do you mean?

160
00:08:19,708 --> 00:08:23,212
Well... how do you know you're
 not supposed to go to... you know...

161
00:08:23,837 --> 00:08:24,671
Heck.

162
00:08:25,589 --> 00:08:27,925
I'm not going to Heck, Butters!
 I'm not black, all right?!

163
00:08:28,884 --> 00:08:29,635
Now look:

164
00:08:29,885 --> 00:08:33,931
I think the reason my soul is still here is because
I need closure with all my friends and loved one.

165
00:08:34,097 --> 00:08:36,850
I can say my final goodbyes to them through you.

166
00:08:37,684 --> 00:08:38,435
I can't.

167
00:08:38,477 --> 00:08:39,603
Ahah I have school tomorrow.

168
00:08:40,145 --> 00:08:41,230
This is your problem, Butters!

169
00:08:41,271 --> 00:08:43,774
Either you help me, or I will haunt you for the rest of your life!

170
00:08:46,818 --> 00:08:47,444
Uh all right.

171
00:08:48,153 --> 00:08:49,196
All right, I'll help you!

172
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,038
- Mrs. Cartman?
- Yes? Oh hi.

173
00:09:00,541 --> 00:09:03,627
This is going to seem very strange and,
 and you may not believe me,

174
00:09:03,961 --> 00:09:06,922
but, well, your son wanted me to tell you something.

175
00:09:07,631 --> 00:09:09,007
Oh, what is it?

176
00:09:09,174 --> 00:09:11,218
Tell her, tell her that I love her.

177
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:13,095
He says, he love you.

178
00:09:16,056 --> 00:09:17,933
Oh, that's so nice.

179
00:09:18,809 --> 00:09:20,435
Tell her, tell her that I wish...

180
00:09:20,853 --> 00:09:22,354
I wish I would have been a better son sometimes!

181
00:09:22,396 --> 00:09:24,204
He wishes he would have been a better son sometimes.

182
00:09:24,204 --> 00:09:27,234
It's just that, it's just that I got so caught up with 
the rat race of life tryin' to succeed that I... sometimes...

183
00:09:27,276 --> 00:09:28,944
took my family for granted!

184
00:09:28,986 --> 00:09:32,656
He he got caught, he got caught up in
 the rat race of, of taking things for granted.

185
00:09:33,198 --> 00:09:37,517
Oh, that's so sweet.
Oh, I love you too, poopiekins!

186
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:53,302
Kyle, Eric wants you to know that he's, he's sorry

187
00:09:53,343 --> 00:09:55,387
for all the times he made fun of
 you being a no-good stinking Jew.

188
00:09:59,433 --> 00:10:03,520
He's asking for your forgiveness.
 And and he wants you to just remember the good times.

189
00:10:03,562 --> 00:10:04,605
Just the good times.

190
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:07,107
There were no good times!

191
00:10:07,149 --> 00:10:09,568
And if he really feels bad he can just tell me himself!

192
00:10:09,693 --> 00:10:11,320
I can't! Don't you understand?!

193
00:10:11,361 --> 00:10:13,238
He can't! Don't you understand?!

194
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:15,324
God forgave the Jews, 
you should be able to forgive me!

195
00:10:15,365 --> 00:10:18,035
God forgave the Jews, 
you should be able to forgive him!

196
00:10:18,702 --> 00:10:19,578
All right, come on, Butters,

197
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:21,788
we gotta go tell Token I'm sorry 
for rippin' on him for bein' black.

198
00:10:22,206 --> 00:10:23,499
Uhh all right then.

199
00:10:27,127 --> 00:10:28,003
Who was that?

200
00:10:28,879 --> 00:10:31,465
It was Cartman having Butters apologize for him.

201
00:10:32,049 --> 00:10:33,217
Dude, he did that to me this morning.

202
00:10:33,926 --> 00:10:35,844
He probably thinks if he apologizes to everyone,

203
00:10:35,886 --> 00:10:37,471
we'll think he's changed and let him back into our circle.

204
00:10:38,722 --> 00:10:40,224
Yeah, we know better than to think that.

205
00:10:40,974 --> 00:10:44,186
Okay, that takes care of Token,
 Clyde, and Mr. Kitty.

206
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:46,313
That's eveyone, I guess.

207
00:10:46,939 --> 00:10:48,524
All that leaves is you, Butters.

208
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:52,861
Butters, I'm sorry if I ever did anything to hurt you.

209
00:10:53,445 --> 00:10:55,113
Aww, that's okay, Eric.

210
00:10:57,324 --> 00:10:58,575
Well, it's all done.

211
00:10:58,659 --> 00:10:59,743
My soul is at peace.

212
00:10:59,993 --> 00:11:01,495
I think... I can go now.

213
00:11:01,537 --> 00:11:02,996
So I won't see you again?

214
00:11:03,038 --> 00:11:04,289
Don't be sad, Butters.

215
00:11:04,331 --> 00:11:07,334
Don't be sad, Butters. What awaits each person 
in heaven is eternal bliss, divine rest,

216
00:11:07,376 --> 00:11:09,253
and ten thousand dollars cash.

217
00:11:11,672 --> 00:11:14,293
G'bye Butters.
I'm goin' to a better place.

218
00:11:14,675 --> 00:11:16,343
Perhaps I'll see you again sometime!

219
00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:18,011
Good-bye!!

220
00:11:24,309 --> 00:11:25,561
Yeh you're still here.

221
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:28,397
Goddamnit, what the fuck is going on?

222
00:11:29,064 --> 00:11:30,983
Well, I guess saying goodbye wasn't enough.

223
00:11:31,024 --> 00:11:32,442
What else do I have to do?!

224
00:11:33,026 --> 00:11:34,177
Well, well, you know,

225
00:11:34,177 --> 00:11:36,488
the preacher says that before your soul can be at peace,

226
00:11:36,530 --> 00:11:39,157
sometimes, you have to atone 
for something bad you did.

227
00:11:39,241 --> 00:11:40,075
Atone?

228
00:11:40,117 --> 00:11:41,743
Did you ever do anything really bad?

229
00:11:43,203 --> 00:11:44,538
Not really...

230
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:49,626
Let's see. Oh, and I broke Mr. Anderson's
 fence and never told him about it.

231
00:11:49,710 --> 00:11:51,253
Broke fence...

232
00:11:51,295 --> 00:11:53,255
took a crap in the principal's purse...

233
00:11:53,505 --> 00:11:54,631
seven times.

234
00:11:55,382 --> 00:11:59,386
Then there was the time I convinced a woman
 to have an abortion so I could build my own Shakey's Pizza.

235
00:12:00,137 --> 00:12:02,723
I pretended to be retarded and joined the Special Olympics.

236
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:06,018
I tried to have all the Jew exterminated last spring.

237
00:12:06,727 --> 00:12:07,936
Uuh, oh yeah, and there's this one kid whose parents I had killed

238
00:12:09,313 --> 00:12:11,440
and then made into chili which I fed to the kid.

239
00:12:13,025 --> 00:12:15,694
Boy oh boy, Eric, you've got a lot to atone for.

240
00:12:15,736 --> 00:12:16,361
Really?

241
00:12:16,403 --> 00:12:17,070
Really.

242
00:12:17,154 --> 00:12:19,990
I mean, honestly, I don't know how you're gonna make up for all this.

243
00:12:21,450 --> 00:12:22,492
I know how.

244
00:12:29,041 --> 00:12:31,752
I'm gonna make, make it right.

245
00:12:31,793 --> 00:12:34,838
I'm gonna take a little time and set things right.

246
00:12:35,005 --> 00:12:37,549
Make, make it right.

247
00:12:37,591 --> 00:12:40,469
I'm payin' for my sins and it sure feels great.

248
00:12:40,511 --> 00:12:43,055
It feels so good to be making up

249
00:12:43,263 --> 00:12:45,891
For all the things I've done wrong.

250
00:12:45,974 --> 00:12:48,635
I know now what the Good Lord in Heaven

251
00:12:49,045 --> 00:12:51,751
Wanted from me all along.

252
00:12:51,751 --> 00:12:55,567
All along, I'm gonna make, make it right.

253
00:12:55,609 --> 00:12:58,195
'Cause Jesus wants me to have a clean slate.

254
00:12:58,237 --> 00:13:00,948
Not faking it, I'm making it right.

255
00:13:01,198 --> 00:13:03,700
I'm payin' for my sins and it sure feels great.

256
00:13:03,909 --> 00:13:09,378
Make, make it right!
Make, make it right!

257
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:14,127
Gonna make it right, girl,
I've got to have your lovin' tonight!

258
00:13:20,676 --> 00:13:22,344
Well, there's everything, Butters.

259
00:13:22,886 --> 00:13:24,346
I've made everything right.

260
00:13:24,930 --> 00:13:27,391
Does this mean... you have to go now?

261
00:13:28,016 --> 00:13:30,102
Yes, Butters, my soul is finally at peace.

262
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:31,645
It's time for me to leave.

263
00:13:32,396 --> 00:13:33,272
Goodbye Butters!

264
00:13:33,397 --> 00:13:34,606
Thanks for all your help!

265
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:36,149
Be good and be safe. Goodbye...

266
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:42,990
Goddamnit, what?!

267
00:13:43,198 --> 00:13:44,658
I've made everything right!

268
00:13:44,741 --> 00:13:48,412
Oh jeez. I I guess maybe your soul
 is stuck here for a different reason.

269
00:13:48,537 --> 00:13:51,748
I want my eternal bliss!
Do you think this is funny, God?!

270
00:13:54,376 --> 00:13:55,836
Do you think this is funny,..?

271
00:13:56,461 --> 00:13:58,005
Eric! Calm down.

272
00:14:00,007 --> 00:14:01,550
Stupid butthole God!

273
00:14:11,059 --> 00:14:12,728
Butters! What have you done?!

274
00:14:12,769 --> 00:14:15,105
Ih ih it wasn't me! Ih it was the ghost!

275
00:14:15,147 --> 00:14:18,205
Oh, Stephen, I don't know if we should
ground him or call a doctor.

276
00:14:18,442 --> 00:14:20,152
No, I think you'd better call a doctor.

277
00:14:20,194 --> 00:14:21,236
I'll ground him.

278
00:14:25,073 --> 00:14:26,241
What do you think, Doctor?

279
00:14:26,283 --> 00:14:28,994
Your son is suffering from severe dementia.

280
00:14:29,203 --> 00:14:32,206
He claims that the ghost of a dead friend talks to him.

281
00:14:32,539 --> 00:14:37,044
This is usually a sign of schizophrenia brought
on by some tragic event in the child's past.

282
00:14:37,377 --> 00:14:40,589
I think it's best that we take him
to the mental center and do some tests.

283
00:14:40,756 --> 00:14:42,883
Oh no.
NO!

284
00:14:43,425 --> 00:14:45,385
INSTITUTE FOR MENTAL HEALTH

285
00:14:51,308 --> 00:14:53,185
All right, Butters, just try to relax.

286
00:15:01,443 --> 00:15:02,694
Doin' just fine, Butters.

287
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:10,661
Just stay perfectly still now, Butters.

288
00:15:17,876 --> 00:15:19,878
Good. You're gonna feel a little pinch now, Butters.

289
00:15:23,841 --> 00:15:27,458
Don't worry, Mr. Stotch.
Whatever traumatized yoru son in his past, we'll find it.

290
00:15:33,559 --> 00:15:35,530
Well, after fourteen hours of testing,

291
00:15:35,554 --> 00:15:39,648
I can say Butters is definitely suffering
from aggravated repressied memory syndrome.

292
00:15:39,690 --> 00:15:40,524
You see, Butters,

293
00:15:40,566 --> 00:15:44,862
when the brain wants to cover something up,
it makes up images and sounds for you to hear.

294
00:15:45,112 --> 00:15:48,407
So... the ghost was in my head.

295
00:15:48,448 --> 00:15:51,072
- The whole time.
- Now do you believe us, Butters?

296
00:15:51,285 --> 00:15:53,245
Yes! Uh yes sir! I believe you.

297
00:15:53,287 --> 00:15:54,955
Good. We're making a lot of headway.

298
00:15:54,997 --> 00:15:56,498
We'll do some more testing tomorrow.

299
00:15:56,832 --> 00:15:58,792
All right, folks. Let's let Butters get some rest.

300
00:15:58,876 --> 00:16:00,335
Goodnight, baby

301
00:16:04,464 --> 00:16:05,090
Butters!

302
00:16:07,301 --> 00:16:08,802
Don't worry, Butters,
I'm gonna get you out of here.

303
00:16:08,844 --> 00:16:11,680
Please leave me alone, Eric.
My bottom is really sore.

304
00:16:11,805 --> 00:16:13,891
I found the woman you need to talk to for me. Look!

305
00:16:14,349 --> 00:16:17,561
Doctor Lindsay, expert in the paranormal.
She can tell us what to do!

306
00:16:17,603 --> 00:16:20,689
Eric, ye-you're just an image in my head
brought on by a traumatic event.

307
00:16:20,731 --> 00:16:22,232
She's gonna close soon! Come on!

308
00:16:22,691 --> 00:16:24,776
Wuh I hate my stupid psychotic brain!

309
00:16:35,996 --> 00:16:37,873
Hello, ma'am. May I talk to you?

310
00:16:38,207 --> 00:16:39,875
Certainly. Come in.

311
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:43,754
Have a seat and tell me what it is you seek.

312
00:16:44,004 --> 00:16:45,589
Well, there's this ghost, see?

313
00:16:45,631 --> 00:16:49,051
Only it probably isn't a ghost,
ih-it's just a delusion brought on by my trauma.

314
00:16:49,092 --> 00:16:52,346
Well I'm supposed to heh, help him,
find out why his spirit is wanderin' the Earth,

315
00:16:52,387 --> 00:16:54,932
even though I know that I'm most
likely just completely insane.

316
00:16:55,265 --> 00:16:58,352
Well, many times, the reason that
the sould stays Earth-bound is

317
00:16:58,393 --> 00:17:02,814
because God is intending to use that soul for a divine purpose,

318
00:17:02,856 --> 00:17:06,485
to help prevent an impending tragic event.

319
00:17:06,944 --> 00:17:10,489
Of course. That's it, Butters!
We had it wrong all the time!

320
00:17:11,114 --> 00:17:15,744
But now, you shouldn't think you're crazy,
young man. I see ghosts all the time.

321
00:17:16,453 --> 00:17:17,079
Really?

322
00:17:17,287 --> 00:17:20,165
Yes. When's the last time you saw yours?

323
00:17:20,249 --> 00:17:22,292
Well, he's sittin' next to me right now.

324
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:32,261
Hey, I think she could see you too.
You really are a ghost.

325
00:17:32,302 --> 00:17:33,345
I told you, Butters.

326
00:17:33,637 --> 00:17:35,138
This is breaking news!

327
00:17:35,597 --> 00:17:38,183
A tragic event is unfolding in South Park.

328
00:17:38,433 --> 00:17:44,064
Three convicted murderers have escaped from jail
and are holding twelve people at the Red Cross!

329
00:17:44,398 --> 00:17:48,694
Tom, the convicts were about to be arrested
when they ran inside the Red Cross behind me,

330
00:17:48,735 --> 00:17:51,280
and threatened to kill all the workers inside.

331
00:17:51,530 --> 00:17:55,242
The violent men are demanding a helicopter
and two hundred thousand dollars cash.

332
00:17:56,326 --> 00:17:57,661
Oh my God, this is it, Butters.

333
00:17:57,911 --> 00:18:00,205
This is what I'm here to stop.
Come on, Butters.

334
00:18:00,247 --> 00:18:03,125
This psychic boy and his ghost pal
are going to save the day!

335
00:18:06,170 --> 00:18:07,087
Stay back, people!

336
00:18:07,171 --> 00:18:09,506
Stay back?!
Hell, my wife and child are in there!

337
00:18:10,048 --> 00:18:12,759
Stay calm in there.
We don't want anybody getting hurt.

338
00:18:13,051 --> 00:18:17,556
You get us a helicopter and two hundred thousand dollars
or these people start dyin', man!

339
00:18:18,682 --> 00:18:20,642
All right, Butters, I'm going in alone, first.

340
00:18:20,684 --> 00:18:23,687
Give me thirty seconds in there,
and then you go in and free the hostiages.

341
00:18:23,729 --> 00:18:25,898
Go in there? Uh, but they'll see me.

342
00:18:26,064 --> 00:18:27,608
Don't worry. I have a plan.

343
00:18:28,275 --> 00:18:28,942
Eric.

344
00:18:30,277 --> 00:18:32,571
Well, be careful, ghost pal.

345
00:18:33,363 --> 00:18:35,574
They can't hurt me, Butters. I'm already dead.

346
00:18:41,079 --> 00:18:42,539
What the hell is that kid doing?

347
00:18:43,290 --> 00:18:44,666
Somebody's comin' in!

348
00:18:44,875 --> 00:18:46,752
It's just some little fat kid.

349
00:18:57,304 --> 00:18:58,805
What the hell is going on?

350
00:18:59,014 --> 00:19:00,390
I have no idea.

351
00:19:00,516 --> 00:19:01,558
Yes, it's working!

352
00:19:05,771 --> 00:19:07,105
This is really weird.

353
00:19:16,448 --> 00:19:18,116
An incredible development here, Tom.

354
00:19:18,158 --> 00:19:21,787
Two little boys have fearlessly
gone inside the Red Cross.

355
00:19:23,622 --> 00:19:24,289
Cartman?

356
00:19:27,584 --> 00:19:29,211
I'm so confused!

357
00:19:31,688 --> 00:19:33,017
Hurry. Go, go!

358
00:19:37,219 --> 00:19:38,512
The hostages are clear!

359
00:19:38,971 --> 00:19:40,097
All right, move in!

360
00:19:44,268 --> 00:19:45,686
The hostages are gone!

361
00:19:46,019 --> 00:19:46,770
What?!

362
00:19:49,898 --> 00:19:51,275
Son of a bitch.

363
00:19:52,067 --> 00:19:54,361
Tom, an incredible story of courage.

364
00:19:54,403 --> 00:19:57,656
Two little boys, armed only with
the weapon of confusion,

365
00:19:57,698 --> 00:20:00,492
managed to go in and save the Red Cross.

366
00:20:00,659 --> 00:20:06,039
Nobody seems to know who the boys are
or where they went off to, but they are heroes.

367
00:20:08,041 --> 00:20:10,544
Well, we did it, Butters.
We saved the day.

368
00:20:10,878 --> 00:20:12,671
Boy, we sure did.

369
00:20:13,922 --> 00:20:15,340
My spirit is at rest now.

370
00:20:15,632 --> 00:20:18,177
I can finally go to everlasting peace, eternal rest,

371
00:20:18,218 --> 00:20:19,469
and ten thousand dollars cash.

372
00:20:20,053 --> 00:20:24,641
Butters, I think that, through this whole thing,
we've really become friends.

373
00:20:25,225 --> 00:20:27,227
Yeah. Uh I feel that way too.

374
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:29,688
We both, kind of needed each other and..

375
00:20:30,355 --> 00:20:32,441
well... I'm gonna miss you.

376
00:20:33,233 --> 00:20:35,569
I'll miss you too, ghost pal.

377
00:20:36,528 --> 00:20:38,739
Goodbye Buttters.
I must be going now.

378
00:20:38,822 --> 00:20:40,449
I'll be looking down on you from time to time.

379
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:42,868
Have a long, fulfilling life, Butters!

380
00:20:43,118 --> 00:20:44,995
Goodbyyye!

381
00:20:46,205 --> 00:20:48,248
Hey Cartman, that was really cool what you did.

382
00:20:48,457 --> 00:20:50,375
Yeah Eric, we're gonna stop ignoring you now.

383
00:20:56,673 --> 00:20:59,134
We didn't think that by pretending you didn't exist,
you would really change,

384
00:20:59,176 --> 00:21:00,010
but you really have.

385
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:03,722
Well, anyway, we just wanna let you know.

386
00:21:03,764 --> 00:21:04,473
Talk to you tomorrow.

387
00:21:04,598 --> 00:21:05,849
Yeah. S-see ya, Eric.

388
00:21:13,982 --> 00:21:15,984
You sonofabitch Butters!

389
00:21:17,194 --> 00:21:18,445
You told me I was a ghost!

390
00:21:18,570 --> 00:21:19,738
Huh but I thought you were one!

391
00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:20,656
How stupid are you?!

392
00:21:20,864 --> 00:21:23,502
How stupid are you?! So help me GOD Butters,
I'm gonna get you back for this! I'm going to

393
00:21:23,502 --> 00:21:24,523
GET YOU BACK!

394
00:21:27,454 --> 00:21:28,080
Butters?!

395
00:21:29,414 --> 00:21:30,582
Oh Hamburgers.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
