4
00:00:39,109 --> 00:00:42,028
Hello, ma'am. I'm working to clean up
 the neighborhood from parasites.

5
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:45,605
Do you mind if I take a quick look around your house?
 I'm afraid you may have hippies.

6
00:00:46,348 --> 00:00:47,237
Hippies?

7
00:00:48,056 --> 00:00:50,000
Yeah, they've been poppin' up all over the neighborhood lately.

8
00:00:51,635 --> 00:00:54,569
Ms. Nelson next door had seven hippies in her basement;
 they usually live in colonies.

9
00:00:56,312 --> 00:00:58,816
I don't like the sound of that.
Could I take a look in your attic?

10
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,238
Oh yeah, boy. Take a look at this, ma'am.

11
00:01:05,702 --> 00:01:06,948
See that? Hippies.

12
00:01:10,696 --> 00:01:11,632
Oh my.

13
00:01:11,835 --> 00:01:15,372
These are what we call the uh giggling stoners. 
Pretty common form of hippie, usually found in the attics.

14
00:01:17,327 --> 00:01:20,123
Problem is, if you see one hippie,
 there's probably a whole lot more you're not seein'.

15
00:01:20,123 --> 00:01:21,272
Uh, whe-where's the backyard.

16
00:01:23,568 --> 00:01:26,740
Yep, that's what I thought. See that?
 You've got a drum circle in your backyard.

17
00:01:29,628 --> 00:01:33,405
Oh, well they showed up a few days ago,
 but I didn't think they were hurting anything.

18
00:01:33,594 --> 00:01:37,075
Yeah. You know, I had a guy in Jackson county. 
He had a little drum circle in his backyard.

19
00:01:37,075 --> 00:01:39,041
It turned into a drum circle four miles in diameter.

20
00:01:39,041 --> 00:01:42,152
You get a few hippies playing drums
 and next thing you know, you got yourself a colony.

21
00:01:42,352 --> 00:01:45,339
Oh dear. Well, so, so what do I do?

22
00:01:46,690 --> 00:01:51,457
Well, your attic could be so we can fumigate with polymerethane.
 The drum circle we're gonna have to gas.

23
00:01:54,281 --> 00:01:59,075
- Goddamnit!
- Whoa, how did I get here? Man, I'm so high.

24
00:01:59,075 --> 00:02:01,246
- Goddamn hippie!
- Whoa, dude!

25
00:02:01,246 --> 00:02:03,561
-Get out of here! 
- Not cool! What's up?!

26
00:02:04,265 --> 00:02:07,491
Ma'am, I need to clear out your giggling stoners 
and your drum-cricle hippies RIGHT NOW,

27
00:02:07,491 --> 00:02:10,809
- or soon they're gonna attract something much worse!
- What's that?

28
00:02:11,031 --> 00:02:12,852
The college know-it-all hippies.

29
00:02:19,097 --> 00:02:23,106
Wow, my friend Brittany was right. 
This is a really laid-back place.

30
00:02:23,358 --> 00:02:26,566
Yeah, this will be a great place to spend spring break.

31
00:02:27,648 --> 00:02:29,445
- Hey, let's ask them.
- All right.

32
00:02:30,307 --> 00:02:35,096
'Scuse me. Hello, we are selling magazine
 subscriptions for our community youth program.

33
00:02:35,096 --> 00:02:39,102
Would you like to help young people like us
 by purchasing a subscription of your choice?

34
00:02:40,378 --> 00:02:43,468
You guys shouldn't be doing that.
 Don't you know what you're doing to the world?

35
00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:45,494
Wha- whataya mean?

36
00:02:45,691 --> 00:02:47,486
You're playing into the corporate game!

37
00:02:47,716 --> 00:02:51,839
See, the corporations are trying to turn you
 into little Eichmanns so that they can make money.

38
00:02:51,961 --> 00:02:53,130
Who are the corporations?

39
00:02:53,538 --> 00:02:58,303
The corporations run the entire world.
 And now they fooled you into working for them.

40
00:02:58,475 --> 00:03:00,013
Are you serious?? We never heard that.

41
00:03:00,154 --> 00:03:03,987
We just spent our first semester at college. 
Our professors opened our eyes.

42
00:03:04,146 --> 00:03:08,105
The government is using its corporate ties 
to make you sell magazines so they can get rich.

43
00:03:08,441 --> 00:03:11,233
- Those dirty liars!
- Sonofabitch!

44
00:03:11,364 --> 00:03:15,779
This is a really nice town you have here. That's why
 the corporations are trying to use you to take it down.

45
00:03:16,102 --> 00:03:19,382
- Well... Well what do we do?
- Just hang with us for a bit.

46
00:03:19,382 --> 00:03:22,397
We'll fill you in on everything 
you haven't been told.

47
00:03:26,087 --> 00:03:30,098
It is time to let us out! I'm sending your names!
Open this door right now!

48
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,303
All right, in you go.

49
00:03:32,732 --> 00:03:35,138
- What are you doing, man?!
- Let us out!

50
00:03:35,138 --> 00:03:37,039
Get back. Get back or you're all gonna get maced!

51
00:03:37,526 --> 00:03:41,680
- What's up, man?! You can't keep us down here like this!
- What's wrong with you?!

52
00:03:41,811 --> 00:03:44,808
What's wrong is that there's more of you showing 
up every day and I need to find out why!

53
00:03:45,017 --> 00:03:46,950
What makes you think you could tell 
us where to live?!

54
00:03:47,019 --> 00:03:48,750
This is a free country, man!

55
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:50,829
Brah, I'm not gonna argue with you, all right?
 Just go with it.

56
00:03:50,829 --> 00:03:53,673
Just go with it? We've been down here for days!

57
00:04:06,142 --> 00:04:10,508
What's goin' on in this world o'mine? 
There's a whole lot of killin' in this world o'mine.

58
00:04:10,508 --> 00:04:13,524
Somebody's gotta help this world o'mine...

59
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:23,140
Sign, sign everywhere. Sign
Done something to my mind

60
00:04:23,944 --> 00:04:26,489
Stan, sweetie, we're gonna go to the mall.
 Do you wanna come?

61
00:04:26,570 --> 00:04:30,205
Mom, the mall is a way for the corporate
 fatcats to imprison you into a life of servitude.

62
00:04:30,205 --> 00:04:31,680
I've got some stuff you should read.

63
00:04:31,841 --> 00:04:32,954
Okay, sweetie.

64
00:04:35,817 --> 00:04:39,464
All right, people, 
we can move onto issue number 14B.

65
00:04:39,464 --> 00:04:43,078
Mayor, we have got to do somethin' 
about all these potholes on our roads!

66
00:04:43,313 --> 00:04:45,410
We don't have it in the budget to fix them right now.

67
00:04:45,538 --> 00:04:48,400
We'll wish we spent the money when 
we have a lawsuit on our hands.

68
00:04:50,207 --> 00:04:53,307
- You can't go in there!
-Please, I have to talk to you all right now!

69
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:56,116
Kid, we're have a city council meeting.

70
00:04:56,297 --> 00:04:59,049
Mayor, something very big is happening, 
and if you all don't give me a moment of your time,

71
00:04:59,049 --> 00:05:00,843
there may be no more South Park to council over!

72
00:05:01,242 --> 00:05:02,386
What are you talking about?

73
00:05:02,514 --> 00:05:04,988
I'm talking about the end of all life as we know it.

74
00:05:06,890 --> 00:05:10,188
For the past several days I've been... 
noticing a steep rise in the number of hippies coming to town.

75
00:05:10,188 --> 00:05:12,245
At first I thought maybe it was just a coincidence.

76
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:13,534
Then I saw this...

77
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,091
Three new drum circles have sprouted up here, 
here, and here.

78
00:05:18,428 --> 00:05:21,679
They're all growing in diameter,
 at a rate of two hippies per hour.

79
00:05:22,281 --> 00:05:25,133
What this means... 
is that the hippies are conglomerating.

80
00:05:25,133 --> 00:05:30,349
They'er thriving, if you will. I think that
 they're setting up for a... hippie music festival.

81
00:05:33,125 --> 00:05:33,542
A what?

82
00:05:33,792 --> 00:05:37,592
Ti's, it's simple science. Look: When hippies start to
 nest in a new area, it draws other hippies in.

83
00:05:37,592 --> 00:05:40,867
With the right weather conditions and topography, 
it can lead to a music festival.

84
00:05:40,867 --> 00:05:44,104
One that last for days, even weeks.
 Reggae on the River, Woodstock, Burning Man,

85
00:05:44,104 --> 00:05:46,337
they will all pale in comparison
 to what we're looking at now.

86
00:05:46,597 --> 00:05:51,094
In my professional opinion... I think we're looking at a full-blown
 hippie jam festival the size of which we've never seen.

87
00:05:56,673 --> 00:05:58,442
Kid, what the hell are you talking about?

88
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:01,041
I know hippies. I've hated them all my life.

89
00:06:01,041 --> 00:06:03,741
I've kept this town free of hippies on
 my own since I was five and a half.

90
00:06:03,961 --> 00:06:07,034
But I can't contain them on my own anymore.
 We have to do something, fast!

91
00:06:07,462 --> 00:06:10,897
Eric, we're, we're talkin' about potholes right now, m'kay.

92
00:06:11,042 --> 00:06:13,948
It's not potholes you need to worry about. It's potheads.

93
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:16,175
I know what these people are capable of.

94
00:06:16,258 --> 00:06:17,930
Johnson, get him out of here.

95
00:06:19,254 --> 00:06:22,929
What are you doing?! You have to listen to me! 
You can't sweep this problem under the rug!

96
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:24,625
The town is in serious danger!

97
00:06:26,637 --> 00:06:31,821
You see, the corporations take their profits 
and invest it in the war machine while keeping everyone blind.

98
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,804
- Right, so how do we get back at them?
- Yeah, we're pissed off.

99
00:06:34,964 --> 00:06:40,173
Well, so my idea was this: Let's have like
 a weeklong music festival, draw everyone here,

100
00:06:40,173 --> 00:06:42,697
and then together, we can tear it all down.

101
00:06:43,468 --> 00:06:44,613
Whoa, what the hell?!

102
00:06:44,613 --> 00:06:48,772
I knew you were trying to have a hippie jam festival! 
All right, everyone pack up your crap, we're going to our basement!

103
00:06:48,935 --> 00:06:50,207
Cartman, what the hell are you doing?!

104
00:06:51,592 --> 00:06:53,247
Oh Jesus, not you guys?

105
00:06:54,332 --> 00:06:57,334
What happened? Were you bit? Did you eat their brownies?
 DID YOU EAT THEIR BROWNIES?!

106
00:06:57,334 --> 00:06:57,637
NO!

107
00:06:58,031 --> 00:07:01,641
Listen, you're my friends, but if you've been comprimised, 
I'll have no problem taking you out!

108
00:07:01,641 --> 00:07:03,258
I'll expect the same from you.

109
00:07:03,258 --> 00:07:06,024
What is your problem? 
Get lost, little Eichmann.

110
00:07:08,897 --> 00:07:11,070
- Oh my God!
- What the hell are you doing?!

111
00:07:11,237 --> 00:07:12,696
Everybody get in a single-file line!

112
00:07:13,767 --> 00:07:14,641
There you are!

113
00:07:14,852 --> 00:07:16,748
Officer Barbrady, you're just in time.

114
00:07:16,748 --> 00:07:19,928
These college know-it-all hippies were setting up 
for a music festival, just as I predicted.

115
00:07:19,928 --> 00:07:21,970
Eric Cartman, you are under arrest.

116
00:07:22,173 --> 00:07:22,587
What?

117
00:07:22,793 --> 00:07:27,304
I was just over at your house and freed sixty-three
 people you had locked in your basement.

118
00:07:27,531 --> 00:07:29,999
You let them out?! 
Jesus, we have to find them!

119
00:07:29,999 --> 00:07:34,066
- Oh no, you're coming downtown!
- No! No, we have to stop them!

120
00:07:34,523 --> 00:07:36,865
You know how we-?!
 We gotta stop them! Hebbiaaay!

121
00:07:38,476 --> 00:07:39,479
Who was that?

122
00:07:41,715 --> 00:07:45,736
- What did I do?!
- You can't kidnap people and lock them in your basement.

123
00:07:45,857 --> 00:07:47,678
They're not people, they're hippies!

124
00:07:47,851 --> 00:07:49,279
Is this problem under control?

125
00:07:49,444 --> 00:07:51,512
I handled it, Mayor. Gee whiz.

126
00:07:51,796 --> 00:07:55,930
Mayor! Mayor, I confirmed the data!
 The hippies are going to have a massive jam band concert!

127
00:07:56,804 --> 00:07:59,332
I know. I signed the permit.

128
00:08:03,192 --> 00:08:04,936
You... You what?

129
00:08:05,973 --> 00:08:08,285
I signed a permit allowing them to have
 their concert here.

130
00:08:08,285 --> 00:08:11,033
Their little "festival" should pump
 some money into our economy.

131
00:08:11,336 --> 00:08:14,328
They're hippies! They don't HAVE any money! 
Does the city council know about this?!

132
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:17,581
They don't have to know.
 I can sign whatever permit I want!

133
00:08:17,623 --> 00:08:19,089
You just sold out our town!

134
00:08:20,698 --> 00:08:23,009
That kid really needs some psychiatric help.

135
00:08:23,156 --> 00:08:23,632
Yeah.

136
00:08:25,766 --> 00:08:26,558
All right, let's go.

137
00:08:27,174 --> 00:08:32,243
How much money is enough, Mayor?! How many 
people's lives it it all worth?! GODDAMNED HIPPIE!

138
00:08:34,056 --> 00:08:36,513
This is a South Park News special report!

139
00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:41,646
Thousands of people have descended
 on South Park for a hippie music jam festival.

140
00:08:41,859 --> 00:08:45,984
The event is said to be the largest 
such gathering in the history of man.

141
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,758
All right, welcome to Hippie Jam Fest 2005!

142
00:08:55,672 --> 00:09:00,536
Sooo great to see sooo many people turn 
out to make an impact on on the world!

143
00:09:02,187 --> 00:09:03,841
- Yeah!
- You said it!

144
00:09:04,086 --> 00:09:08,771
For too long, the corporations have bled 
the world of its love and resources!

145
00:09:09,007 --> 00:09:12,652
It is time for us to get to work
 and make the world a better place!

146
00:09:12,810 --> 00:09:15,473
And we'reg onna start right now.

147
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,588
Oh man, I can't wait to see the look on those little 
Eichmanns' faces when they hear this crunchy groove.

148
00:09:28,277 --> 00:09:32,355
- Sharon, have, have you seen Stan?
- He went with his friends to that music festival.

149
00:09:32,545 --> 00:09:35,025
Oh, Jesus, what has gotten into that kid?!

150
00:09:35,025 --> 00:09:37,356
Now, Randy, we were the same way once, too.

151
00:09:37,356 --> 00:09:40,332
Don't forget that we were both considered
 hippies back in the '60s.

152
00:09:40,332 --> 00:09:42,947
Yeah, but when we did it we actually stood for something.

153
00:09:42,947 --> 00:09:46,568
I mean, remember Woodstock, Sharon? 
We actually did something there.

154
00:09:59,558 --> 00:10:02,320
You ate too much acid, man!

155
00:10:10,402 --> 00:10:13,410
...Oh my God. Our son is with those people.

156
00:10:13,652 --> 00:10:15,281
Stan... STAN!!

157
00:10:16,658 --> 00:10:18,110
This is South Park News!

158
00:10:18,436 --> 00:10:22,880
Fear and horror in South Park today 
as the music festival continues to grow.

159
00:10:23,059 --> 00:10:26,389
They're arriving in droves and apparently
 no end is in sight.

160
00:10:27,044 --> 00:10:31,286
Tom, the crowd just keeps getting bigger 
and the town is literally bursting at the seams.

161
00:10:31,286 --> 00:10:36,036
We don't know where this music festival came from,
 but, it's very close to consuming us all.

162
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,478
Steven, what do we do?

163
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:52,116
Stan?! Stan?! I need to get through, please!

164
00:10:52,528 --> 00:10:56,875
Randy! Randy, you've got to get out of here!
If they just trample this park, we'll be trapped! It's too dangerous!

165
00:10:56,875 --> 00:10:58,690
My son is in there!

166
00:11:07,356 --> 00:11:11,671
- Heey, chill man. It's all good.
- Have some water laced with acid.

167
00:11:19,346 --> 00:11:20,690
What have I done?

168
00:11:21,390 --> 00:11:24,633
Yeah, South Park is now the hippie
 capital of the world!

169
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,200
Hi Eric, uh, how's it goin'?

170
00:11:41,079 --> 00:11:43,477
Great, I love crapping in a toilet with no rim on it.

171
00:11:43,763 --> 00:11:46,515
Eric, you were right. About the hippies.

172
00:11:46,871 --> 00:11:49,037
Could you... get rid of them for us now?

173
00:11:50,456 --> 00:11:53,513
Let me guess: they've started 
a hippie jam band music festival.

174
00:11:53,997 --> 00:11:56,444
We we need to take care of them, Eric!
 They're out of control!

175
00:11:57,634 --> 00:11:58,299
Forget it.

176
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,928
Please. Some of our kids are in there. 
We should've listened to you earlier.

177
00:12:04,266 --> 00:12:05,821
Yeah. We apologise

178
00:12:06,047 --> 00:12:07,913
Please. Don't let them ruin our town.

179
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,619
It's too late! Even if I did agree to help,
 there's too many of them now!

180
00:12:11,619 --> 00:12:16,911
We know you can do it, Eric. You're smart.
 Wha- why you're the smartest kid in school, m'kay?

181
00:12:16,911 --> 00:12:21,748
We're just asking you to try. The whole town even 
got together and, and baked you a cake.

182
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:26,775
Don't think that you can buy me with presents!

183
00:12:27,973 --> 00:12:31,947
Unless of course it's the new Tonka 
radio-controlled play bulldozer.

184
00:12:33,257 --> 00:12:36,393
- It's yours.
- I want the batteries for it too.

185
00:12:36,393 --> 00:12:38,391
And I get to drive it around in
 the school parking lot.

186
00:12:38,870 --> 00:12:40,473
- Fine.
- Anything else?

187
00:12:41,762 --> 00:12:44,833
Yes, Kyle doesn't get to have one! Ever!

188
00:12:44,833 --> 00:12:48,550
And he has to watch me drive mine around
 the school parking lot and get super-jealous!

189
00:12:48,550 --> 00:12:52,472
Well, we can promise not to buy one for Kyle,
 but we we can't make him watch you play th...

190
00:12:53,291 --> 00:12:55,555
Oh yes! Fine! We'll force Kyle to watch you.

191
00:12:55,609 --> 00:12:57,806
All right, fine. But now listen up and listen good!

192
00:12:58,016 --> 00:13:00,092
I've never tried to get rid of this many hippies before,

193
00:13:00,092 --> 00:13:02,795
so I'm gonna need every resource this town has!

194
00:13:02,866 --> 00:13:05,871
And even if I don't succeed, 
and it's a million-to-one shot that I will,

195
00:13:05,871 --> 00:13:08,956
I still get the Tonka radio-controlled bulldozer 
and get to play with it in the school

196
00:13:08,997 --> 00:13:11,533
parking lot where Kyle has to watch me 
and get super-jealous because he doesn't have one!

197
00:13:11,533 --> 00:13:12,215
Are we clear?!

198
00:13:21,802 --> 00:13:25,000
Wow, this band is so crunchy.
 Dude, I need more weed.

199
00:13:25,586 --> 00:13:29,142
So it seems like we have enough people now.
 When do we start taking down the corporations?

200
00:13:29,810 --> 00:13:33,480
Yeah man, the corporations. 
Right now they're raping the world for money!

201
00:13:33,740 --> 00:13:35,411
Yeah, so, where are they. Let's go get 'em.

202
00:13:35,550 --> 00:13:39,819
Right now we're proving we don't need corporations. 
We don't need money.

203
00:13:39,819 --> 00:13:42,910
This can become a commune where
 everyone just helps each other.

204
00:13:43,056 --> 00:13:49,329
Yeah, we'll have one guy who like, who like, makes bread. 
A-and one guy who like, l-looks out for other people's safety.

205
00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:50,831
You mean like a baker and a cop?

206
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,743
No no, can't you imagine a place where people
 live together and like,

207
00:13:54,743 --> 00:13:58,808
provide services for each other
 in exchange for their services?

208
00:14:00,281 --> 00:14:01,304
Yeah, it's called a town.

209
00:14:01,763 --> 00:14:07,998
You kids just haven't been to college yet. 
But just you wait, this thing is about to get huge.

210
00:14:10,442 --> 00:14:15,454
All right, everyone listen up! The hippie jam band
 festival is now 14 miles in diameter

211
00:14:15,690 --> 00:14:17,377
and 5 000 hippies thick.

212
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:18,990
My God...

213
00:14:19,251 --> 00:14:22,248
In less than three days, 
all of South Park will be completely consumed.

214
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:27,265
My only hope is to fight our way to
 the center of the crowd, and reach the heart, here.

215
00:14:27,608 --> 00:14:32,292
If we can reach the stage, 
we can upload this Slayer CD into their music system.

216
00:14:32,450 --> 00:14:34,276
Hippies can't stand death metal.

217
00:14:34,461 --> 00:14:37,546
If everything works, they should disperse
 just before they consume us all.

218
00:14:38,739 --> 00:14:41,426
Nice plan, kid,
 except there's one giant flaw.

219
00:14:41,579 --> 00:14:46,105
That hippie crowd is massive! How the hell are
 we supposed to get through it and reach the stage?

220
00:14:46,732 --> 00:14:47,330
We drill.

221
00:14:48,664 --> 00:14:51,477
I've designed a vehicle that can bore its way
 through even the densest hippie crowd.

222
00:14:51,690 --> 00:14:54,656
They pilots inside will be safe from the pot
 smoke and the crappy music outside.

223
00:14:55,450 --> 00:15:00,645
Yuh... actually suggesting that somebody drives right into
 the heart of that mob?? It's a suicide mission!

224
00:15:00,967 --> 00:15:03,738
Not just somebody. 
I need a complete team to operate this vehicle.

225
00:15:03,857 --> 00:15:07,035
Along with me I'm gonna need a scientest, 
an engineer, and of course,

226
00:15:07,035 --> 00:15:09,667
a black person who can sacrifice 
himself in case something goes wrong.

227
00:15:11,067 --> 00:15:14,440
- I'm the... only scientist in town.
- I'm your engineer.

228
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:16,886
- Honey, no!
- I have to do it, Steven.

229
00:15:17,094 --> 00:15:21,815
All right, then we just need a black person who can 
sacrifice himself in case something goes wrong.

230
00:15:22,484 --> 00:15:25,816
Lessee, anyone would do, anyone who meets the qualifications, let's see...

231
00:15:27,261 --> 00:15:30,098
- I know. How about
- Yeah, yeah! I get it! Fine!

232
00:15:30,275 --> 00:15:33,732
I I can't believe we're actually listening to this. 
This is a crazy plan!

233
00:15:33,732 --> 00:15:36,994
You got a better ides, Steven?!
 Damnit, my son is in there!

234
00:15:37,166 --> 00:15:42,238
There's no more time for ideas! We have to have this vehicle up
 and operational in less than three days!

235
00:15:42,442 --> 00:15:45,598
Look, it's a long shot!
 But it's also the only shot we-

236
00:15:51,928 --> 00:15:52,439
got.

237
00:16:12,404 --> 00:16:17,479
Tom, I'm standing in South Park, Colorado,
 where a desparate attempt to save the town is underway.

238
00:16:17,631 --> 00:16:23,332
Some call it a suicide mission, but the heroic men 
and women of the hippie digger may be our only hope of survival.

239
00:16:31,617 --> 00:16:33,619
Well I... guess this is it, Sharon.

240
00:16:34,148 --> 00:16:36,113
Please, save our boy, Randy.

241
00:16:36,813 --> 00:16:40,937
Butters, if anything happens to Mommy,
 I, I want you to be a good boy.

242
00:16:41,265 --> 00:16:42,428
Ah I will, Mom.

243
00:16:43,510 --> 00:16:46,148
Now, now, don't cry, ladies.
 Everything's gonna be fine.

244
00:16:47,346 --> 00:16:50,080
I... don't want you to worry about me, Clyde Frog.

245
00:16:52,644 --> 00:16:55,317
Hey! You're the best stuffed animal I've ever had.

246
00:17:01,647 --> 00:17:03,094
Look out for yourselves!

247
00:17:03,482 --> 00:17:04,683
Godspeed!

248
00:17:08,779 --> 00:17:10,324
- Primary engine running?
- Check.

249
00:17:10,631 --> 00:17:12,355
- Navigation systems?
- Online

250
00:17:12,836 --> 00:17:13,998
Let's punch this baby.

251
00:17:17,734 --> 00:17:19,915
We're coming up on the outer perimeter of the hippies. Hang on.

252
00:17:24,795 --> 00:17:28,012
- Reaching hippie crowd. Hull status?
- Vehicle shell holding!

253
00:17:32,803 --> 00:17:35,604
- They're in!
- All right! All right, yeah! We did it!

254
00:17:35,766 --> 00:17:38,932
All right, people, let's save it!
They still have a long way to go!

255
00:17:49,278 --> 00:17:52,044
All right, I can't take it anymore! 
I'm getting on that stage!

256
00:17:52,419 --> 00:17:53,282
You're doing what?

257
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,429
Hey, you can't go up there.

258
00:18:03,568 --> 00:18:08,071
- Switching to secondary fuel line.
- The drill is getting too hot from all the hippies.

259
00:18:11,837 --> 00:18:12,472
What's happened?

260
00:18:12,642 --> 00:18:15,148
They, they s- they stopped. 
Somethin's wrong.

261
00:18:15,493 --> 00:18:17,768
Jesus... they're dead in the water.

262
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,576
Excuse me. Excuse me,
 can I have your attention please?

263
00:18:28,463 --> 00:18:29,435
What are we doing?

264
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,824
It's been nine days! Doesn't it seem
 like we should accomplish something?

265
00:18:36,325 --> 00:18:39,711
We're using the power of rock and roll 
to change the world!

266
00:18:41,924 --> 00:18:45,767
Maybe instead of complaining about corporations
 being selfish, we should lookt at ourselves.

267
00:18:45,767 --> 00:18:49,975
I mean, is there anything more selfish than doing nothing 
but getting high and listening to music all day long?

268
00:18:50,937 --> 00:18:57,541
He's right. It's time for all of us to focus our energy 
and get this hippie jam into full swing.

269
00:19:03,682 --> 00:19:07,068
- Come on, come on!
- It's useless. The main power line has been shut down.

270
00:19:07,292 --> 00:19:10,194
Somebody's gonna have to go outside 
and activate the backup boosters.

271
00:19:10,345 --> 00:19:11,960
No, Chef, I'm not gonna let you go out ther

272
00:19:13,489 --> 00:19:14,613
...I didn't volunteer!

273
00:19:15,036 --> 00:19:16,450
...All right, fine Chef, go!

274
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:19,735
...Aw damnit!

275
00:19:27,209 --> 00:19:30,087
That's it. We're going to Plan B. Nuke the crowd!

276
00:19:30,173 --> 00:19:32,164
Goddamnit no!
 Y-you have to give them more time!

277
00:19:42,724 --> 00:19:45,332
Dude, these people have no idea what's going on.
 Let's get out of here.

278
00:19:45,491 --> 00:19:49,010
We can't. Kenny just checked. There's a wall of
 people like seven miles thick behind us.

279
00:19:49,010 --> 00:19:52,486
What?? You mean,
 we're stuck here listening to this crap?

280
00:20:00,993 --> 00:20:03,398
Hey, what happened to the tunes, man?

281
00:20:03,816 --> 00:20:06,648
More tunes. More tunes!

282
00:20:08,923 --> 00:20:09,713
We made it.

283
00:20:10,210 --> 00:20:11,380
Hit the PA system NOW!

284
00:20:13,714 --> 00:20:14,715
Put me in the main line!

285
00:20:15,924 --> 00:20:16,721
Which cord is it?

286
00:20:16,721 --> 00:20:18,148
You're the scientist, jackass!

287
00:20:18,370 --> 00:20:19,221
I'm a geologist!

288
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:21,313
We don't have time to argue!
 They're gonna nuke us!

289
00:20:22,222 --> 00:20:22,971
Put them in my laptop!

290
00:20:24,683 --> 00:20:27,269
Slayer - "Raining Blood"

291
00:20:33,078 --> 00:20:35,403
Oh man, not cool.

292
00:20:35,403 --> 00:20:37,454
This music is so angry.

293
00:20:38,488 --> 00:20:42,381
This is killing my buzz.
Let's bail on this whole angry scene.

294
00:20:48,133 --> 00:20:50,132
- It's working!
- What??

295
00:20:50,359 --> 00:20:51,878
It's, it's working!

296
00:20:52,586 --> 00:20:54,142
We did it! We did it!

297
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,476
- Dad!
- Stan!

298
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:05,899
I'm alive!

299
00:21:06,767 --> 00:21:08,326
Hold it right there, Kyle!

300
00:21:10,757 --> 00:21:13,650
Cartman. We aren't gonna be hippies anymore. 
Y-you don't have to kill us.

301
00:21:14,010 --> 00:21:17,936
Kill you? Oh no.
 I have much bigger plans for you now.

302
00:21:22,157 --> 00:21:24,949
Aw man, this is awesome! Weeeee!

303
00:21:25,542 --> 00:21:27,042
Oh here, Kyle, you wanna play with it a little while.

304
00:21:27,791 --> 00:21:31,604
Oh, psych! You don't get to! Hehe.
Oh, check it out! Cooool!
