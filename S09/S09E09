1
00:00:34,011 --> 00:00:34,906
What are you guys all doing here?

2
00:00:34,906 --> 00:00:38,092
I don't know, I,
 I got this emergency letter from Cartman,

3
00:00:38,127 --> 00:00:38,848
who said to meet in his basement?

4
00:00:38,883 --> 00:00:40,284
Yeah, us too.

5
00:00:41,546 --> 00:00:43,147
Ah, gentlemen, thank you for coming.

6
00:00:44,047 --> 00:00:46,918
We don't have a lot of time,
so I'll cut to the chase:

7
00:00:47,372 --> 00:00:49,877
The girls at our school have been
 hiding something from us!

8
00:00:50,119 --> 00:00:51,895
Hiding something huge...

9
00:00:53,805 --> 00:00:54,786
What ?

10
00:00:55,202 --> 00:00:58,527
What if I were to tell you... 
that the girls have a device...

11
00:00:58,562 --> 00:01:01,673
which allows them to see...
 into the future?

12
00:01:02,335 --> 00:01:03,195
What ??

13
00:01:03,408 --> 00:01:04,697
How do you know?

14
00:01:05,133 --> 00:01:08,388
The girls do not have a device that shows
 them the future, Cartman! That's retarded!

15
00:01:08,714 --> 00:01:11,526
You, sir, mocked Cartman before, 
yet you two sit here demanding answers!

16
00:01:11,561 --> 00:01:13,061
Now damn you let him speak!

17
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,050
Thank you, Clyde.

18
00:01:18,354 --> 00:01:20,138
Aaaagh, I'm afraid it's true.

19
00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:25,534
Uh, I secretly videotaped the girls on the playground
 yesterday using my Wellington Bear video camera.

20
00:01:25,569 --> 00:01:27,775
I caught the following images on tape.

21
00:01:28,035 --> 00:01:31,534
I warn you, these images may be too shocking for young children.

22
00:01:32,413 --> 00:01:34,505
Oh okay, I'm not lookin'.

23
00:01:34,925 --> 00:01:36,921
Video Playback Initialized!

24
00:01:40,158 --> 00:01:42,235
Cool!Okay, my turn, my turn!
 Do me now!

25
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:44,116
Okay Bebe, what do you want to know?

26
00:01:44,151 --> 00:01:46,743
I want to know if I want to live
 in a big mansion in the future.

27
00:01:46,778 --> 00:01:48,489
Okay, let's find out. Ready?

28
00:01:49,005 --> 00:01:50,013
Pick a number.

29
00:01:50,181 --> 00:01:51,054
Four.

30
00:01:51,054 --> 00:01:53,692
One two three four. Okay, pick a color.

31
00:01:53,727 --> 00:01:54,366
Blue.

32
00:01:54,401 --> 00:01:56,808
B L U E. All right, pick another color.

33
00:01:56,843 --> 00:01:57,154
Red.

34
00:01:57,189 --> 00:02:01,468
'Kaaay. 
Okay, will Bebe live in a big mansion in the future?

35
00:02:01,503 --> 00:02:02,851
Definitely yes!

36
00:02:02,886 --> 00:02:03,671
All right!

37
00:02:03,706 --> 00:02:06,299
Woohoo! You rock, Bebe!

38
00:02:06,334 --> 00:02:08,152
Whoa! Wow!

39
00:02:08,187 --> 00:02:11,254
Do me next. 
I wanna know if I'm gonna marry somebody cute

40
00:02:11,289 --> 00:02:12,996
I'll do it! I'll do it!
Pick a number.

41
00:02:13,031 --> 00:02:13,496
Three.

42
00:02:13,531 --> 00:02:16,726
One two three. Nooow, pick a color.

43
00:02:16,761 --> 00:02:18,467
G R E E N

44
00:02:18,502 --> 00:02:19,337
Now blue!

45
00:02:19,372 --> 00:02:20,511
The answer is no.

46
00:02:22,167 --> 00:02:23,873
Aw dangit!

47
00:02:23,908 --> 00:02:26,289
Oh my God, how does it know the answer?

48
00:02:26,324 --> 00:02:28,205
I... don't believe it.

49
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:31,698
Believe it! The girls can ask it any question 
they want and it gives them an answer.

50
00:02:32,382 --> 00:02:33,556
Freeze image!

51
00:02:34,915 --> 00:02:38,376
Gemtemen, we have to get our hands on that device.

52
00:02:49,696 --> 00:02:51,870
How is the incubation shield coming, Clyde?

53
00:02:51,905 --> 00:02:52,708
It's all set.

54
00:02:52,743 --> 00:02:56,667
Once we have the device, it can be housed in here 
safely until we know what we're dealing with.

55
00:02:56,702 --> 00:02:57,882
Good man.

56
00:02:58,810 --> 00:02:59,983
Any luck here?

57
00:03:00,018 --> 00:03:02,863
The outside of the device seems to be covered in numerals.

58
00:03:02,898 --> 00:03:06,649
Inside are colors... which must open up 
some sort of temporal timewall

59
00:03:06,684 --> 00:03:10,063
Good. Keep working. We want to know all we can
 before we try to operate it.

60
00:03:10,870 --> 00:03:14,143
All right, gentlemen, our containment center for 
the timewall is nearly complete.

61
00:03:14,178 --> 00:03:17,111
All that's left for us to do is get the device
 from the girls and bring it here.

62
00:03:17,146 --> 00:03:18,270
Let's go take it.

63
00:03:18,271 --> 00:03:19,585
Don't be a fool, Craig.

64
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:22,679
Do you really think the girls are just gonna
 hand that technology over?

65
00:03:22,714 --> 00:03:24,087
So what do you suggest?

66
00:03:24,318 --> 00:03:27,943
Heidi Turner is going to have a
 slumber party on Thursday night.

67
00:03:27,978 --> 00:03:31,222
There's no doubt in my mind the girls will be using 
the future-telling device there.

68
00:03:31,257 --> 00:03:33,743
If we... can get somebody invited to that slumber party,

69
00:03:33,778 --> 00:03:37,854
not only can we get a hold of the device,
 but, find out how to use it.

70
00:03:38,108 --> 00:03:42,544
Yeah, there's just one problem: a boy can't
 go to a chicks' slumber party.

71
00:03:42,579 --> 00:03:45,699
No, not a boy, but a girl.

72
00:03:46,656 --> 00:03:54,198
One of us is gonna have to go undercover, show up in school 
tomorrow disguised as the new girl who just moved to town

73
00:03:55,406 --> 00:03:57,618
You mean like that movie, Juwanna Mann?

74
00:03:58,555 --> 00:04:02,402
No, not like Juwanna Mann, Kevin, okay?!
 It's way cooler than that!

75
00:04:02,437 --> 00:04:06,335
But if one of us pretends to be the new girl in class, 
the girls will wonder where that boy went.

76
00:04:06,370 --> 00:04:08,931
Which is why we have to fake that boy's death.

77
00:04:08,966 --> 00:04:10,432
It's simple spy stuff, my friends.

78
00:04:10,467 --> 00:04:14,733
Take your top man, fake his death, then send him
 in disguised as the enemy.

79
00:04:14,801 --> 00:04:17,687
That's a pretty solid idea. But who?

80
00:04:20,925 --> 00:04:22,235
Mr. and Mrs. Stotch?

81
00:04:22,270 --> 00:04:24,062
Yes? What is it, officer?

82
00:04:24,097 --> 00:04:24,962
You'd better come quick.

83
00:04:24,963 --> 00:04:27,338
Your son is at the Bowery Building 
threatening to kill himself.

84
00:04:27,715 --> 00:04:28,819
What ??

85
00:04:34,890 --> 00:04:38,249
Don't do it, son! You have too much to live for!

86
00:04:40,627 --> 00:04:42,519
Oh my God, Butters!

87
00:04:42,964 --> 00:04:45,162
Oh uh, hi Mom.

88
00:04:46,088 --> 00:04:48,695
Just keep stalling, Butters. We don't have the 
dead pig quite ready yet

89
00:04:54,271 --> 00:04:58,306
Butters? Butters, whatever is troubling you, this isn't the answer!

90
00:04:58,341 --> 00:05:00,881
Look at all these people who've come out for you!

91
00:05:00,916 --> 00:05:05,492
Just come down now, son, and ...we promise we won't 
ground you for more than a couple of weeks.

92
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:08,832
N'aw geez! Now I'm gonna get grounded, too.

93
00:05:08,867 --> 00:05:10,771
Okay, it's ready! Step down, Butters!

94
00:05:12,210 --> 00:05:14,942
He, h-he's coming down! Oh thank God!

95
00:05:15,517 --> 00:05:17,664
No, wait, whatwhat's he doing??

96
00:05:19,833 --> 00:05:22,156
Okay. One! Two!

97
00:05:22,191 --> 00:05:23,194
JEEESUS CHRIST!

98
00:05:27,785 --> 00:05:30,504
OHHHH MY GOD!!

99
00:05:33,524 --> 00:05:35,034
He... didn't make it.

100
00:05:35,914 --> 00:05:42,497
NOOOOOO!! NOOOOOO!! 
My son is DEEAAD!! NOOOOOO!!

101
00:05:42,532 --> 00:05:43,889
Nice.

102
00:05:45,521 --> 00:05:50,105
And he shall be remembered as the peaceful 
little boy who warmed his parent's hearts.

103
00:05:53,724 --> 00:06:00,662
Lord, as we commit this child's body to the earth,
 may we ask it be the last child you strike down so mercilessly.

104
00:06:00,697 --> 00:06:04,318
We know this request to be futile, Lord,
 but just thought we would ask.

105
00:06:05,664 --> 00:06:08,998
NOOOOOO!! NOOOOOO!! BUTTERS!!

106
00:06:09,902 --> 00:06:16,163
NOOOOOO!! Don't put him down there!! 
Don't put him down there!!

107
00:06:17,682 --> 00:06:20,022
Okay children, let's take our seats.

108
00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:26,389
Now I know that we're all still in deep, deep mourning
 over the tragic death of our classmate, Butters

109
00:06:27,163 --> 00:06:28,551
Who's Butters?

110
00:06:28,586 --> 00:06:30,954
But we all must try to move on

111
00:06:30,989 --> 00:06:36,305
And so I'd like you to help me welcome a new student
 who has just moved here from Dallas.

112
00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:39,880
Children, please say hello to...
 Marjorine.

113
00:06:39,915 --> 00:06:42,299
Oh, uh, hello.

114
00:06:43,748 --> 00:06:45,845
Welcome to our school, Marjorine.

115
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:48,021
Oh... Thank you.

116
00:06:48,056 --> 00:06:51,701
Dude, I think it's totally working. 
The girls are totally buying it.

117
00:06:51,736 --> 00:06:55,004
Why don't you tell the children
 a little about yourself, Marjorine?

118
00:06:55,467 --> 00:06:57,777
Well, I'm just a typical little girl.

119
00:06:57,812 --> 00:07:04,252
I like dancin', an' and ponies, a-a-and getting
 my snootch pounded on Friday night.

120
00:07:04,287 --> 00:07:05,371
Nice.

121
00:07:05,406 --> 00:07:07,634
Now Marjorine, that's not very lady-like.

122
00:07:07,669 --> 00:07:12,086
Us Colorado girls love to get pounded in the snootch
 just like any woman, but we keep it to ourselves.

123
00:07:13,444 --> 00:07:15,523
That girls sure has a strange sense of fashion.

124
00:07:15,558 --> 00:07:18,741
Dude, they totally think he's a girl.

125
00:07:19,315 --> 00:07:20,777
All right, have a seat, Marjorine,

126
00:07:20,812 --> 00:07:24,536
I'm sure all the other girls will be happy to show you 
around the school. Won't you, girls?

127
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:27,623
Where do you buy your clothes?

128
00:07:27,658 --> 00:07:31,528
Oh. Uhm, you know. Girl places.

129
00:07:31,563 --> 00:07:35,856
Dude, they've bought it hook line and sinker. 
 This is going swimmingly.

130
00:07:42,763 --> 00:07:45,382
Heidi, sweetie, 
I'm just gonna set the snacks over here.

131
00:07:45,417 --> 00:07:46,436
'Kay Mom.

132
00:07:47,119 --> 00:07:52,251
Oh, and Heidi, there's going to be one extra girl
 coming to your slumber party.

133
00:07:53,244 --> 00:07:53,861
Who??

134
00:07:53,896 --> 00:07:56,620
The new girl in your class, Marjorine.

135
00:07:56,655 --> 00:07:59,109
Mom, I didn't invite her!

136
00:07:59,144 --> 00:08:02,482
I know, sweetie,
 but I got a call from Marjorine's mother.

137
00:08:02,517 --> 00:08:03,614
Her mother ?

138
00:08:03,649 --> 00:08:07,080
She said Marjorine is having a really 
hard time being in a new school.

139
00:08:07,115 --> 00:08:10,450
Her mom asked me personally if we could have Marjorine over,

140
00:08:10,485 --> 00:08:16,935
and besides, her mother told me that she works as a
 state official and that I should ... respect her authroitay.

141
00:08:21,721 --> 00:08:24,206
Linda? Linda, please come downstairs.

142
00:08:24,241 --> 00:08:34,693
Why couldn't we help him? 
Why is our little boy dead?

143
00:08:37,718 --> 00:08:41,179
Oh Butters! Oh Butters, 
I miss you so much!

144
00:08:44,950 --> 00:08:47,788
Mr. Stotch. I know what you're thinkin'.

145
00:08:48,711 --> 00:08:49,533
Who are you?

146
00:08:49,568 --> 00:08:51,557
I came to talk you out of it.

147
00:08:51,592 --> 00:08:57,745
You need tuh... just accept that your son is dead, 
not try to bring him back.

148
00:08:58,841 --> 00:09:01,367
Bring him back? 
Why... What are you talking about?

149
00:09:01,402 --> 00:09:05,919
I know you're thinkin' of puttin; him up there,
 the Indian Burial Ground up that road.

150
00:09:05,954 --> 00:09:09,347
You're thinking if you bury his body there, 
he will come back alive.

151
00:09:09,382 --> 00:09:11,550
Sometimes, dead is better.

152
00:09:11,585 --> 00:09:13,436
Indian... Burial Ground?

153
00:09:13,724 --> 00:09:19,144
It's been done before, what you're thinkin' of. 
The Nelson boy, back in '85.

154
00:09:19,179 --> 00:09:24,701
You're saying if I... dig up my son's body and rebury him 
at the... old Indian Burial Ground, that I-

155
00:09:24,736 --> 00:09:29,769
Don't do it, Stotch! What comes out of the ground
 ain't the thing you put in.

156
00:09:29,804 --> 00:09:34,183
The Indians knew that. That's why they stopped
 using it when the ground went sour.

157
00:09:34,218 --> 00:09:36,516
I'm just here to talk you out of it.

158
00:09:38,603 --> 00:09:42,439
Don't bury your son's body at the Indian Burial Ground, Stotch!

159
00:09:42,474 --> 00:09:49,000
The one that's right up over there, behind the 
Andersons' bar. Sometimes... dead is better.

160
00:09:55,965 --> 00:09:57,840
All right, Butters, that's Heidi's house.

161
00:09:57,875 --> 00:10:00,897
Huh I can't do it, felas. 
I can't go into a girls' slumber party!

162
00:10:00,932 --> 00:10:02,586
What if they find out I ain't a girl?

163
00:10:02,621 --> 00:10:04,093
You're gonna be fine.

164
00:10:04,128 --> 00:10:07,592
Now Butters, we don't know exactly what it is
 that girls do at their slumber parties.

165
00:10:07,627 --> 00:10:11,231
But if they all start, you know, 
lezzing out, just roll with it.

166
00:10:11,266 --> 00:10:13,168
Lezzing out? What's lezzing out?

167
00:10:13,203 --> 00:10:16,972
Now look, Butters, when the girls bring out the 
future-telling device, pay attention to how it works

168
00:10:17,007 --> 00:10:19,928
Once you know how to operate it, just grab it 
and get the hell out of there.

169
00:10:19,963 --> 00:10:22,710
Wuh then I can go home and tell my mommy 
and daddy I'm not really dead?

170
00:10:22,745 --> 00:10:25,456
Youh dude, of course.
 Now go, the party's already started.

171
00:10:25,491 --> 00:10:26,610
Good luck, man

172
00:10:27,666 --> 00:10:31,303
Remember Butters, you must get that future-telling
 device from the girls at all costs!

173
00:10:31,338 --> 00:10:33,938
And just roll with it if they start lezzing out.

174
00:10:39,127 --> 00:10:41,680
All right, now we all want you to have a good time.

175
00:10:41,715 --> 00:10:46,938
But as Heidi's parents, tonight it is our responsibility 
to look out for all of you.

176
00:10:46,973 --> 00:10:55,438
There's not gonna be any drinking, no pot, and most importantly,
 if I catch any boys anywhere near this party, they're gonna 
be in a world of hurt.

177
00:10:59,201 --> 00:11:01,010
All right, have a nice time, girls

178
00:11:02,322 --> 00:11:04,390
So, what do you guys wanna do first?

179
00:11:04,425 --> 00:11:05,664
We could play "girl talk."

180
00:11:07,119 --> 00:11:09,984
I brought the new Justin Timberlake CD.
 We should dance to it.

181
00:11:12,146 --> 00:11:14,462
How about we read each other's futures?

182
00:11:14,497 --> 00:11:16,889
I know. Let's do
 "Light as a feather, stiff as a board."

183
00:11:24,370 --> 00:11:25,860
Who wants to go first?

184
00:11:25,895 --> 00:11:26,492
I will.

185
00:11:27,803 --> 00:11:30,245
Oh geez, are we gonna start lezzing out?

186
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:40,437
Light as a feather, stiff as a board.

187
00:11:46,714 --> 00:11:48,351
Jesus, what are they doing in there?

188
00:11:48,386 --> 00:11:52,668
God only knows the horrors that go on in girls' slumber
 parties. Let's just hope Butters can survive it.

189
00:11:52,703 --> 00:11:56,937
AAAAAAAAAAH NOO! Witches! You're all witches!

190
00:11:57,391 --> 00:11:59,833
Marjorine, what is your problem?!

191
00:11:59,868 --> 00:12:03,153
Huh? Oh nothin'. 
Hey, you guys wanna tell each other's futures now?

192
00:12:03,857 --> 00:12:10,496
Yeah. I can tell you your future, Marjorine! You're going
 to live alone your entire life because you're a nerdy dorky geed!

193
00:12:10,531 --> 00:12:12,390
Yeah, and your hair is totally stupid!

194
00:12:13,686 --> 00:12:15,565
Yeah, and you're flat

195
00:12:16,685 --> 00:12:19,987
Marjorine, why don't you just leave?!
 Nobody wants you here!

196
00:12:32,561 --> 00:12:37,261
Hello son. Don't you worry. 
Daddy's gonna make everything all right again

197
00:12:51,144 --> 00:12:54,311
There he is. There's my boy!
 Come on, Butters!

198
00:12:55,762 --> 00:12:59,097
Oh... Butters... smell like... bacon.

199
00:12:59,132 --> 00:13:04,013
Don't worry. We're gonna bring you back, son.
 We're gonna bring you back!

200
00:13:07,794 --> 00:13:09,807
I think we went too far with Marjorine

201
00:13:09,842 --> 00:13:11,562
She's in the bathroom crying.

202
00:13:14,668 --> 00:13:15,849
Marjorine?

203
00:13:17,197 --> 00:13:19,001
Nobody likes meee...

204
00:13:20,506 --> 00:13:22,483
Aw gee, she's really upset.

205
00:13:22,518 --> 00:13:26,012
I feel terrible, you guys. 
It can't be easy being the new girl in school.

206
00:13:26,047 --> 00:13:29,743
Marjorine? Marjorine?
Hey, we didn't mean it.

207
00:13:30,050 --> 00:13:32,705
You don't know how hard it is to be me.

208
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:35,735
Marjorine, we were just teasing.
 We think you're great.

209
00:13:35,770 --> 00:13:38,980
You think I'm uglee-eeheheee.

210
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:41,998
You're not ugly, Marjorine.

211
00:13:42,033 --> 00:13:44,478
You said I'm ugly and I'm flat.

212
00:13:44,513 --> 00:13:50,568
Marjorine, you just have a different look, that's all. 
We just... we need to help you bring out your inner beauty.

213
00:13:50,603 --> 00:13:53,392
Yeah. How about we all give you
 a little makeover, Marjorine?

214
00:13:53,427 --> 00:13:55,489
Yeah, Let's go!

215
00:13:58,227 --> 00:13:59,527
You mean it?

216
00:14:01,421 --> 00:14:03,775
Dude, it's been too long. Something's wrong

217
00:14:03,810 --> 00:14:05,030
Maybe they found him out.

218
00:14:05,065 --> 00:14:06,731
Then, he's already dead.

219
00:14:06,766 --> 00:14:08,207
Come on, we gotta go check on him

220
00:14:13,570 --> 00:14:14,560
Can you see anything?

221
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:23,044
He's just dancing around.

222
00:14:23,079 --> 00:14:24,337
That sonofabitch!

223
00:14:27,914 --> 00:14:31,341
Marjorine, sweetie, your mom's on the phone.

224
00:14:32,496 --> 00:14:33,519
My mom?

225
00:14:35,085 --> 00:14:35,869
Hello ?

226
00:14:35,904 --> 00:14:38,253
Butters! 
Just what the fuck do you think you're doing?!

227
00:14:38,288 --> 00:14:40,769
Well, I'm just havin' some fun with my girlfriends.

228
00:14:40,804 --> 00:14:45,215
You aren't there to have fun, you black asshole!
You were supposed to be getting the future-telling device.

229
00:14:45,250 --> 00:14:46,353
Well, I'm workin' on it!

230
00:14:46,388 --> 00:14:48,192
Working on what?! Your dance moves?!

231
00:14:48,227 --> 00:14:55,688
Now look! I'm getting pretty sick of this! Well I put
 myself through a lot, and you can't talk to me like that! Uh, mom.

232
00:14:55,723 --> 00:14:58,470
Just do what you were sent in there to do, dickface!

233
00:15:12,563 --> 00:15:14,462
Hey Marjorine, you wanna know your future?

234
00:15:15,712 --> 00:15:19,079
Ah. Uhh. Could I hold that?

235
00:15:19,114 --> 00:15:21,359
Sure. 
Here, you do my future.

236
00:15:22,937 --> 00:15:23,670
How?

237
00:15:23,973 --> 00:15:27,855
Well uh you know, it's easy. You just put your
 thumbs and index fingers in here...

238
00:15:32,765 --> 00:15:36,621
Aha! I knew it! Boys in the slumber party!

239
00:15:37,168 --> 00:15:38,639
There's a boy here?

240
00:15:39,306 --> 00:15:45,562
Stand back! I had a... great time tonight, 
but I gotta do what I was sent here to do!

241
00:15:52,446 --> 00:15:54,351
He's got it! He's got the device!

242
00:15:55,031 --> 00:15:56,931
Tango tango tango! We've got it!

243
00:15:57,471 --> 00:15:59,379
Let's get it to the cointainment center! Go!

244
00:15:59,414 --> 00:16:00,396
Come on, Butters.

245
00:16:00,431 --> 00:16:06,484
No! That darn device is nothin' but trouble! Ah I'm done,
 and I'm goin' home to tell my Mom and Dad I'm not dead!

246
00:16:07,909 --> 00:16:09,098
What the hell?

247
00:16:09,133 --> 00:16:13,808
Haaahahahaha, we have the device now! 
The power belongs to us!

248
00:16:18,012 --> 00:16:20,414
Anybody have a piece of notebook paper
 so I can make another one?

249
00:16:23,110 --> 00:16:25,417
Go! Go! Get in the containment field!

250
00:16:40,071 --> 00:16:42,932
Stephen, you did what??

251
00:16:42,967 --> 00:16:46,639
I had to, Linda. If there was even the slightest
 chance it would bring him back!

252
00:16:46,674 --> 00:16:49,883
I don't know! 
I don't know what I'm doing anymore!

253
00:16:49,918 --> 00:16:54,683
You dug up our son's body??
 Performed some kind of pagan ritual??

254
00:16:54,718 --> 00:16:58,891
Linda, I did it for you! 
You wanted him back so much. So did I!

255
00:16:58,926 --> 00:17:00,290
Not Like this.

256
00:17:01,185 --> 00:17:08,307
Not like this. He wouldn't be our son, Stephen. 
He would be a walking abomination.

257
00:17:08,342 --> 00:17:10,698
An unholy demon spawn!

258
00:17:19,465 --> 00:17:20,010
Hello?

259
00:17:21,298 --> 00:17:22,702
It's him.

260
00:17:22,737 --> 00:17:23,892
Keep the door locked.

261
00:17:26,249 --> 00:17:31,102
Mom? Dad? 
Ih it's me, Butters. I'm back.

262
00:17:32,497 --> 00:17:34,420
Oh God...

263
00:17:52,249 --> 00:17:56,781
It's gone, dear. It's gone. Forgive me.

264
00:17:56,816 --> 00:17:58,428
Huhey Mom and Dad, I'm not-

265
00:18:02,953 --> 00:18:06,332
Oh God, it's terrible! What have I done?!

266
00:18:06,367 --> 00:18:08,982
Uh, I guess you're probably
 a little surprised to see me.

267
00:18:09,017 --> 00:18:11,814
IT ISN'T RIGHT! MAKE IT GO AWAY!

268
00:18:15,483 --> 00:18:21,801
Gentlemen, this is a historic day for all of boy- and mankind!
In a few moments, we will know the future

269
00:18:23,177 --> 00:18:26,544
Ho- hold on guys. 
We're not sure what this device is capable of.

270
00:18:26,579 --> 00:18:28,654
Maybe we should wait until we've had more time to study it.

271
00:18:28,689 --> 00:18:32,291
No, no! We don't have tome for that, Stan! 
It's time to ask it a question.

272
00:18:32,326 --> 00:18:33,686
How come you get to use it first?

273
00:18:34,067 --> 00:18:35,617
Because I do, Clyde.

274
00:18:35,618 --> 00:18:36,707
I wanna use it.

275
00:18:36,742 --> 00:18:40,196
I'm askin' the first question! 
Let's just start with something simple.

276
00:18:40,231 --> 00:18:42,683
Will Kyle die before he's twenty?

277
00:18:42,718 --> 00:18:44,650
Wait! I don't wanna know that

278
00:18:44,685 --> 00:18:46,804
Ask it if the Broncos are gonna win on Sunday.

279
00:18:46,839 --> 00:18:48,843
Naw, dude, then it won't be fun to watch!

280
00:18:48,878 --> 00:18:50,164
Will you all just shut up so I can do this?!

281
00:18:50,199 --> 00:18:51,455
You shut up, asshole!

282
00:18:51,490 --> 00:18:53,346
I don't wanna know when I'm going to die, fatass!

283
00:18:55,771 --> 00:18:57,117
Guys, guys, guys, stop!

284
00:18:57,905 --> 00:18:59,774
Look at what this thing is doing to us.

285
00:19:01,141 --> 00:19:05,310
Butters was trying to tell me something outside the house. 
That this device is nothing but trouble.

286
00:19:05,345 --> 00:19:06,994
I think I know what he meant now.

287
00:19:07,029 --> 00:19:08,519
How can it be nothing but trouble?

288
00:19:08,554 --> 00:19:13,083
We risked everything to get it from the girls. 
How long before the girls attack us to get it back?

289
00:19:14,678 --> 00:19:19,089
Yeah. Forget about the girls, what about if the CIA 
or, or the Russians know we have this?

290
00:19:19,124 --> 00:19:20,469
They'll come after it for sure.

291
00:19:20,504 --> 00:19:22,366
Maybe we should take it to someplace safer.

292
00:19:22,401 --> 00:19:24,692
And then what? 
Hide forever from the government?

293
00:19:24,727 --> 00:19:26,923
>From the... terrorists who want to use it for evil?

294
00:19:27,877 --> 00:19:31,033
Maybe... maybe nobody is meant to have this kind of power.

295
00:19:33,345 --> 00:19:34,553
You mean, destroy it.

296
00:19:35,682 --> 00:19:38,419
Are you guys nuts?! 
After everything we've gone through?!

297
00:19:38,454 --> 00:19:40,650
We got it away from the girls. 
That's what matters.

298
00:19:40,685 --> 00:19:44,332
But now the right thing to do isn't using it ourselves,
 then we're no better than they are.

299
00:19:44,367 --> 00:19:45,783
Think of the power!

300
00:19:45,818 --> 00:19:51,037
It's too much power. For anybody. Stan's right.
 It has to be destroyed.

301
00:19:59,062 --> 00:20:02,208
Are we sure about this? 
We'll never know the future.

302
00:20:02,243 --> 00:20:06,061
Nobody will. That's the way it's supposed to be.
 Hit it, Kenny

303
00:20:19,064 --> 00:20:20,131
Damn, Ken!

304
00:20:21,293 --> 00:20:26,667
Here. Here, you see?
 It's going to be all right. Hello... son.

305
00:20:28,532 --> 00:20:29,429
Hi Dad.

306
00:20:30,718 --> 00:20:32,928
He was supposed to stay dead!

307
00:20:32,963 --> 00:20:35,488
Mom, Dad, can I come upstairs now?

308
00:20:35,523 --> 00:20:40,757
Sorry, son, but... you're a demon spawn now. 
You're an abomination.

309
00:20:40,792 --> 00:20:44,002
Can I please just have somethin' to eat?
 Well I'm pretty hungry.

310
00:20:44,037 --> 00:20:46,718
It's... hungry.

311
00:20:47,342 --> 00:20:50,356
Yes... It must feed.

312
00:20:52,513 --> 00:20:54,836
Hello, I'm Rachel with Quality Curtains.

313
00:20:56,278 --> 00:20:58,524
Oh yes. Thank you for coming.

314
00:20:58,677 --> 00:21:00,510
Which room are we looking at?

315
00:21:00,545 --> 00:21:02,737
Just follow me to the basement.

316
00:21:02,772 --> 00:21:05,198
Yes. The basement.

317
00:21:06,502 --> 00:21:10,492
Oh my, it's pretty dark down here.
 You sure you need curtains?

318
00:21:12,265 --> 00:21:13,993
Uh hello, I'm Butters

319
00:21:14,705 --> 00:21:17,130
Little boy, what are you doing down here?

320
00:21:19,358 --> 00:21:21,927
Here you go, son. Eat!

321
00:21:22,583 --> 00:21:24,345
What are we becoming?!

322
00:21:24,346 --> 00:21:27,099
Come on. Don't watch it feed.

323
00:21:29,917 --> 00:21:32,404
Can't I just have some Spaghetti-O's??

324
00:21:32,405 --> 00:21:33,405
