00:00:34,993 --> 00:00:36,245
This is is, Stan.

5
00:00:36,286 --> 00:00:38,163
If you strike this kid out, 
we all get to go home.

6
00:00:38,372 --> 00:00:41,500
Now batting for Conifer is little Alan Barkas.

7
00:00:44,044 --> 00:00:46,797
No hit no hit can't hit can't hit
can't hit it can't hit it can't hit it.

8
00:00:46,839 --> 00:00:49,758
Hit it out of the park, Alan!
South Park sucks!

9
00:00:50,259 --> 00:00:54,847
Just look at those boys out there, lovin' the great
game of baseball like we did when we were kids.

10
00:00:56,723 --> 00:00:59,017
Aw God, I'm so borrred.

11
00:01:01,562 --> 00:01:04,940
I see a ladybug- Hello lady ladybug.

12
00:01:08,485 --> 00:01:09,319
Strike.

13
00:01:09,403 --> 00:01:11,989
That was no strike!
What the hell is wrong with you, ref?

14
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:13,574
Good call, ref! Good call!

15
00:01:13,782 --> 00:01:16,159
Come on, Alan! This pitcher throws like a girl!

16
00:01:16,201 --> 00:01:17,160
What'd you say?!

17
00:01:17,202 --> 00:01:18,579
You heard me, asshole!

18
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:20,330
You want me to kick your ass right here?!

19
00:01:20,372 --> 00:01:21,331
Randy, sit down.

20
00:01:21,373 --> 00:01:22,332
You want a piece of me?!

21
00:01:22,374 --> 00:01:24,459
'Cause I'm pretty sick of your Goddamned mouth!

22
00:01:26,837 --> 00:01:28,827
Whattaya wanna do, huh?
 Whattaya wanna do?

23
00:01:28,964 --> 00:01:30,090
Randy, don't!

24
00:01:30,174 --> 00:01:31,425
You'd better shut up, asshole!

25
00:01:31,466 --> 00:01:33,260
I'm standin' right here!
 How do you wanna handle it?

26
00:01:33,302 --> 00:01:34,720
I told you to SHUT UP!

27
00:01:43,187 --> 00:01:44,855
Aw Jesus, not again.

28
00:01:46,356 --> 00:01:49,568
Come on, Stan! Just strike this kid
 out so we can end the season!

29
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,531
Strike three! You're out!

30
00:01:55,115 --> 00:01:57,075
Yes! It's over! It's over!

31
00:01:57,075 --> 00:01:59,494
That's it. South Park wins the game 4 to 0.

32
00:01:59,536 --> 00:02:01,371
We're done! No more baseball!

33
00:02:01,371 --> 00:02:03,457
No more boring baseball until next year!

34
00:02:03,498 --> 00:02:05,042
We can start having fun again!!

35
00:02:08,337 --> 00:02:10,422
Yeah, we did it, boys!
We did it!

36
00:02:10,714 --> 00:02:12,390
We're going to the finals!

37
00:02:15,761 --> 00:02:16,428
... What?

38
00:02:16,637 --> 00:02:19,806
Well we won! That means we've 
got the best record in the division!

39
00:02:20,015 --> 00:02:22,809
Congratulations, boys!
 You're goin' on to the post-season.

40
00:02:23,727 --> 00:02:24,520
Post-season?

41
00:02:24,561 --> 00:02:26,438
Nobody said anything about a post-season.

42
00:02:26,855 --> 00:02:29,608
There's more little-league baseball for South Park!

43
00:02:33,987 --> 00:02:34,613
No...

44
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:36,323
NOOO!!

45
00:02:37,324 --> 00:02:39,826
This is for what?! 
Arresting me for what?!

46
00:02:39,993 --> 00:02:43,705
I'm not allowed to stand up for myself?!
I thought this was America!

47
00:02:43,789 --> 00:02:47,376
Huh?! Isn't this America!?
I'm sorry, I thought this was America!

48
00:02:52,339 --> 00:02:53,507
I can't believe it.

49
00:02:53,632 --> 00:02:55,551
I can't believe we have to keep on playing.

50
00:02:55,717 --> 00:02:58,428
Nobody told us if we win too many 
games we'd go on to the finals!

51
00:02:59,012 --> 00:03:01,056
Look, you guys, maybe it's not all that bad.

52
00:03:01,306 --> 00:03:02,349
Not all that bad??

53
00:03:02,391 --> 00:03:05,185
How could you say that?!
You hate this game more than any of us!

54
00:03:05,227 --> 00:03:06,270
I know, but listen:

55
00:03:06,353 --> 00:03:08,313
the finals are all sudden-deatn 
elimination, right?

56
00:03:08,355 --> 00:03:10,649
That means as soon as we 
lose one game, our season is over.

57
00:03:11,567 --> 00:03:14,111
Well yeah, but... we usually win.

58
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:15,904
All the other teams are worse than us.

59
00:03:16,113 --> 00:03:19,002
Yeah. Let's face it, we're winners.

60
00:03:19,741 --> 00:03:21,493
I know we can lose if we try.

61
00:03:21,618 --> 00:03:24,685
You mean, throw the game?
You know how our parents are about this sport.

62
00:03:24,746 --> 00:03:29,918
Yeah. My dad always said "It's Okay to lose,
but if you don't try, wuh you're grounded, Mister."

63
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:34,978
Okay, so then we'll just tell the other team 
quietly that we're gonna let them win,

64
00:03:34,978 --> 00:03:36,300
then we'll act like we're trying.

65
00:03:36,341 --> 00:03:37,676
Our parents will never know.

66
00:03:38,343 --> 00:03:41,305
We'd better hope they never know, 
or else there's gonna be heck to pay.

67
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:42,848
Heck, I tell ya!

68
00:03:44,933 --> 00:03:46,185
Boy, that was great, wasn't it?!

69
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:48,145
Yeah, our boys really stuck it to 'em!

70
00:03:51,648 --> 00:03:52,482
You're out.

71
00:03:52,566 --> 00:03:53,984
How much was bail this time?

72
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:55,485
Hundred bucks, no big whoop.

73
00:03:55,652 --> 00:03:58,405
Boy, you really beat the crap out of that Conifer dad.

74
00:03:58,572 --> 00:04:01,074
Well somebody had to put that
 knucklehead in his place.

75
00:04:01,158 --> 00:04:03,160
Yeah, well, you'd better watch 
yourself in the playoffs.

76
00:04:03,202 --> 00:04:04,620
Wha-what do you mean?

77
00:04:04,661 --> 00:04:08,248
I mean, you always get in a fight with scrappy 
redneck dats up here in the mountains,

78
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:10,501
but some of those Division Two dads are tough!

79
00:04:10,626 --> 00:04:13,504
Yeah, those dads get REALLY drunk and obnoxious.

80
00:04:13,712 --> 00:04:16,673
I can fight anybody. I just need to train.

81
00:04:17,132 --> 00:04:20,594
I just need to get in the best shape of my life.

82
00:04:22,788 --> 00:04:25,817
the Beatles in the White Album in Helter Skelter. Okay.

83
00:05:04,555 --> 00:05:09,810
We want to welcome all South Park parents to Fort Collins,
 and the Little League Division One Playoffs.

84
00:05:15,566 --> 00:05:17,734
Uhh, hay guys, look, we don't wanna win, so uh,

85
00:05:17,818 --> 00:05:20,654
here's a list of all the pitches
 I'm gonna throw, in order.

86
00:05:22,781 --> 00:05:24,366
I don't think so, South Park

87
00:05:24,575 --> 00:05:26,034
Yeah, you think we wanna win?

88
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:28,191
Then we have to keep playing this boring game!

89
00:05:28,191 --> 00:05:31,165
- Yeah!
- You hate this game too?

90
00:05:31,248 --> 00:05:35,085
Yeah! And then we won the stupid regionals 
and had to do this lousy-ass tournament!

91
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:36,920
We wanna play video games.

92
00:05:37,379 --> 00:05:38,338
Oh no!

93
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:40,382
Look! We're gonna be the losers tonight, all right?!

94
00:05:40,424 --> 00:05:41,550
I don't think so!

95
00:05:41,675 --> 00:05:43,385
There's no way you can lose to us!

96
00:05:43,427 --> 00:05:46,263
We're going doowwn! 
We're gonna get creeaamed!

97
00:05:46,305 --> 00:05:48,056
No, we're gonna get creamed!

98
00:05:48,098 --> 00:05:49,600
We'll just see about that!

99
00:05:49,641 --> 00:05:51,393
- Oh yeah?
- Yeah!

100
00:05:51,602 --> 00:05:54,146
Oh boy, they're really gettin' into each
others' heads out there.

101
00:05:54,229 --> 00:05:56,273
Yeah! Let's go, South Park!

102
00:05:56,356 --> 00:05:58,442
These Fort Collins kids got nothin'! Wooo!

103
00:05:59,818 --> 00:06:02,070
Come on, Fort Collins! Let 'em have it! Yeah!

104
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:04,615
Guess that's my guy.

105
00:06:04,948 --> 00:06:06,617
I can take him, no problem.

106
00:06:08,869 --> 00:06:10,370
All right, hit one out of the park!

107
00:06:10,996 --> 00:06:14,541
And first up for Fort Collins is... Morgan Pratt.

108
00:06:18,212 --> 00:06:19,796
Knock it out of the park, Morgan!

109
00:06:19,963 --> 00:06:21,298
Cream these turds!

110
00:06:25,886 --> 00:06:28,051
- Steerike!
- Yeah!

111
00:06:28,534 --> 00:06:30,625
- Yeah, all right!
- Damnit!

112
00:06:30,891 --> 00:06:32,643
Come on, kid, you gotta at least swing at it.

113
00:06:32,726 --> 00:06:34,186
No way! I'm striking out!

114
00:06:34,311 --> 00:06:36,313
Dude, he's not gonna swing!
 So just throw balls.

115
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:38,315
That way he'll have to walk to first base.

116
00:06:41,693 --> 00:06:42,569
Ball!

117
00:06:42,903 --> 00:06:43,529
All right!

118
00:06:43,612 --> 00:06:46,031
- Morgan!
- What?

119
00:06:46,073 --> 00:06:48,742
You have to swing when it's a ball,
otherwise, you're gonna walk to first base.

120
00:06:48,825 --> 00:06:50,619
Don't swing, only if it's a strike!

121
00:06:50,786 --> 00:06:53,956
Well how the Sam Hell am I supposed to know
 if he's gonna be throwing a strike or a ball?!

122
00:06:54,164 --> 00:06:55,457
You just have to guess.

123
00:06:55,624 --> 00:06:56,458
Aw, Jesus!

124
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:01,046
Ball. Balll.

125
00:07:03,549 --> 00:07:04,800
Steerike two!

126
00:07:05,008 --> 00:07:05,843
No!

127
00:07:06,134 --> 00:07:08,053
That was no strike, that was a terrible pitch!

128
00:07:08,095 --> 00:07:09,805
You need some Goddamned lasik surgery!

129
00:07:09,847 --> 00:07:12,516
Attaway, South Park! They ain't swingin' at nothin'!

130
00:07:12,599 --> 00:07:15,519
Come on Fort Collins! This team can't pitch!

131
00:07:18,021 --> 00:07:19,982
There you go, Morgan! Run run run!

132
00:07:20,148 --> 00:07:20,983
Aw damnit!

133
00:07:21,316 --> 00:07:22,734
Why the hell did you swing at it?!

134
00:07:22,776 --> 00:07:24,736
Well I thought he was gonna throw
 a ball that time!

135
00:07:27,114 --> 00:07:28,615
Strike three! You're out!

136
00:07:28,657 --> 00:07:29,491
All right!

137
00:07:31,285 --> 00:07:32,327
Ball four!

138
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:33,078
What?!

139
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,162
Walk to first! Woo!

140
00:07:34,663 --> 00:07:35,706
Goddamnit!

141
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:39,334
- Safe!
- Crud!

142
00:07:41,003 --> 00:07:42,963
Fort Collins can't play!

143
00:07:43,338 --> 00:07:45,674
Why don't you shut your mouth
 before I kick your ass!

144
00:07:47,259 --> 00:07:49,303
Come on, let's go! I'm right here!

145
00:07:49,303 --> 00:07:49,970
Randy...

146
00:07:50,095 --> 00:07:51,972
Sit down before you get hurt!

147
00:07:53,849 --> 00:07:54,683
Mother bitch!

148
00:07:57,686 --> 00:07:58,478
Goddamnit!

149
00:08:00,397 --> 00:08:01,648
Strike three!

150
00:08:05,861 --> 00:08:07,738
That's it. South Park wins the game.

151
00:08:09,656 --> 00:08:10,699
Aw spit!

152
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:14,828
Oh I'm sorry! Why don'tcha get
'im on chars in America, I'm sorry!

153
00:08:15,037 --> 00:08:17,122
Welcome to Greeley, home of the Tigers.

154
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,500
Strike three. You're out.

155
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:23,361
Yeah!
All right! Yeah! Woohoo!

156
00:08:23,361 --> 00:08:27,939
- Goddmanit Brian, swing!
- Greeley sucks! Greeley sucks!

157
00:08:28,967 --> 00:08:29,885
Ball four!

158
00:08:30,427 --> 00:08:32,270
- Aw hamburgers.
- God!

159
00:08:37,809 --> 00:08:38,644
Strike three!

160
00:08:38,894 --> 00:08:41,355
How the hell was that a strike?!
Goddamnit, he's going to first!

161
00:08:42,356 --> 00:08:44,775
What, is this a Communist country or something?!

162
00:08:44,983 --> 00:08:46,401
I thought this was America!

163
00:09:07,756 --> 00:09:10,884
This is America! This is an honest America!

164
00:09:17,808 --> 00:09:21,436
Can you believe it, boys?!
 We're playing in the State Championship Game!

165
00:09:24,022 --> 00:09:25,816
We're so proud of you kids!

166
00:09:25,858 --> 00:09:28,277
What happens if we win
 the State Championship game?

167
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:31,864
Well, then your whole season starts over,
 but on the national circuit!

168
00:09:31,905 --> 00:09:34,783
You get to spend your whole summer playing baseball!

169
00:09:34,867 --> 00:09:35,576
What??

170
00:09:35,617 --> 00:09:37,953
You could do it, kids!
 We know you can win State!

171
00:09:37,995 --> 00:09:42,666
Then we'll spend the whole summer going to 
Nebraska, and to Iowa, and Wyoming.

172
00:09:42,875 --> 00:09:44,626
Oh no. No, no, no!

173
00:09:48,964 --> 00:09:50,966
Dad? Dad, we need to talk.

174
00:09:51,133 --> 00:09:54,428
Can you believe it, Stan?
 State Championship game.

175
00:09:55,179 --> 00:09:57,264
It's... the greatest thing ever.

176
00:09:59,433 --> 00:10:00,934
Goddamnit.

177
00:10:02,394 --> 00:10:04,479
I've worked hard, believed in myself,

178
00:10:04,897 --> 00:10:08,025
and now I'm gonna be fighting in a 
State Championship game.

179
00:10:09,193 --> 00:10:11,695
This is gonna be the biggest fight of my life.

180
00:10:14,406 --> 00:10:16,408
This is News 4, at noon.

181
00:10:17,242 --> 00:10:20,746
The Colorado Little League State Championship
 is being played this week.

182
00:10:20,829 --> 00:10:25,417
Two teams of youngsters get to go head to head
 at the major-league stadium downtown.

183
00:10:25,918 --> 00:10:31,006
Tom, I'm standing here with the little sluggers 
and some of their parents, and I can;t tell you how excited they are.

184
00:10:31,215 --> 00:10:32,966
I don't suppose you guys want to win this game.

185
00:10:33,091 --> 00:10:34,676
Win? Why the hell would we want to win?

186
00:10:34,676 --> 00:10:37,554
Yeah. Then we'd have to play this boring game all summer.

187
00:10:37,554 --> 00:10:40,432
Little Stan Marsh is the pitcher for
 the South Park Little League team, and Stan,

188
00:10:40,807 --> 00:10:43,644
how does it feel to be playing for the State Championship?

189
00:10:44,061 --> 00:10:44,728
Gay.

190
00:10:44,895 --> 00:10:46,897
Mr. Marsh, you must be very proud of your son.

191
00:10:46,939 --> 00:10:49,358
They've worked really hard to get here,
 Chris,and, you know,

192
00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:53,362
I don't like to really "trash-talk," but,
 I don't think Denver has a chance.

193
00:10:53,654 --> 00:10:57,366
Oho, well, I'm sure some of the Denver kids' 
parents would disagree with you and your team-

194
00:10:57,407 --> 00:10:59,535
Oh yeah!
Oh yeah!

195
00:10:59,785 --> 00:11:01,828
South Park is goin' down!

196
00:11:01,912 --> 00:11:03,789
Feel it comin'!

197
00:11:03,831 --> 00:11:05,666
You ain't got a chance, South Park!

198
00:11:05,707 --> 00:11:08,710
Here we go, Denver, here we go!

199
00:11:08,877 --> 00:11:09,711
Who's that?

200
00:11:09,753 --> 00:11:12,089
That's Tom Nelson, one of the Denver players' fathers.

201
00:11:12,172 --> 00:11:16,426
He goes to every game in that ridiculous outfit 
and usually drinks too much and gets into a fight.

202
00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:19,763
There ain't no way some little
 mountain kids can beat Denver.

203
00:11:19,805 --> 00:11:21,974
Not with my son on second base!

204
00:11:22,099 --> 00:11:24,643
Oho, looks like we got some parental
 trash talking going on here.

205
00:11:24,685 --> 00:11:25,936
Mr. Marsh, any comments?

206
00:11:26,019 --> 00:11:27,396
Well I think that there's a uh...

207
00:11:27,437 --> 00:11:28,689
Mr. Marsh??

208
00:11:28,730 --> 00:11:30,899
Who wants to hear from a Mr. Marsh?!

209
00:11:30,941 --> 00:11:34,278
Iii am the ultimate Little League trash-talking father!

210
00:11:34,361 --> 00:11:36,989
Iii am the Bat Dad!

211
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:38,866
All right, Mr. Nelson, let's go, come on.

212
00:11:38,907 --> 00:11:42,619
Bat Dad knows no fear!
 Bat Dad knows no pain!

213
00:11:42,661 --> 00:11:45,164
I want you, Marsh! I want you!!

214
00:11:46,248 --> 00:11:47,958
Well, tension is certainly high here,

215
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,460
but I guess everything will be decided on the playing field.

216
00:11:50,669 --> 00:11:52,296
Oh my God.

217
00:11:52,921 --> 00:11:54,756
Good luck! You're gonna need it.

218
00:11:54,798 --> 00:11:57,134
Yeah, you can't lose to us. We're terrible.

219
00:11:59,011 --> 00:12:01,388
Dude, what are we gonna do??
 We can't win this game.

220
00:12:01,388 --> 00:12:03,056
Wiat. I've got it, you guys.

221
00:12:03,098 --> 00:12:07,519
A fifth point in a sports movie, the team always goes
 out and finds a really sweet player to join their team.

222
00:12:07,686 --> 00:12:09,855
Like that motorcycle kid in Bad News Bears.

223
00:12:09,897 --> 00:12:11,064
Exactly right, Clyde.

224
00:12:11,231 --> 00:12:15,986
So what we need... is to find somebody
 to join our team, who totally sucks ass.

225
00:12:16,111 --> 00:12:16,945
Hey yeah.

226
00:12:17,112 --> 00:12:19,740
We need to find the very worst
 kid athlete in the whole world.

227
00:12:19,781 --> 00:12:21,408
Somebody who can't possibly win.

228
00:12:21,575 --> 00:12:22,409
But who?

229
00:12:22,993 --> 00:12:23,827
I know who.

230
00:12:24,995 --> 00:12:28,373
Announcing the arrival of flight six seven three, 
from New York City.

231
00:12:31,793 --> 00:12:33,504
I'm baaack!

232
00:12:34,755 --> 00:12:38,050
There he is! Now, don't let him know we
 think he's a loser, or else he won't play.

233
00:12:39,885 --> 00:12:41,011
Hello, cousin Kyle.

234
00:12:41,053 --> 00:12:42,888
Oh Jesus, that flight was terrible.

235
00:12:42,930 --> 00:12:45,849
They served a chicken dish with
 hot sauce and it gave me gas.

236
00:12:45,933 --> 00:12:47,893
Dude, thanks for helping us out by joining our team.

237
00:12:47,893 --> 00:12:51,021
Well, you said you needed my help to win the big game, so here I am.

238
00:12:51,104 --> 00:12:53,273
I'll need a wipe cloth if I'm gonna play, though.

239
00:12:53,315 --> 00:12:57,361
Sometimes I sweat from holding the bat for
 so long and then the heat steams up my glasses.

240
00:12:58,403 --> 00:12:59,404
He's perfect.

241
00:12:59,446 --> 00:13:02,157
Yeah, with him on our team,
 we don't stand a chance.

242
00:13:53,667 --> 00:13:54,751
...I'm not gonna go.

243
00:13:56,128 --> 00:13:56,753
What?

244
00:13:57,796 --> 00:13:59,298
Stan's little league game, I'm...

245
00:13:59,715 --> 00:14:00,716
I'm not gonna go.

246
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:02,634
Why?

247
00:14:04,011 --> 00:14:07,681
I just... don't think I can, all right?

248
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:10,058
You don't think you can?!

249
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:11,768
This is the biggest game of your son's life!

250
00:14:11,810 --> 00:14:13,061
Wny wouldn't you go and support him? What-?

251
00:14:13,103 --> 00:14:14,813
Because I'm scared, all right?!

252
00:14:16,857 --> 00:14:20,235
You wanna break me down?!
 You wanna hear me say it?! I'm scared!

253
00:14:21,445 --> 00:14:23,572
I don't know if I believe in myself anymore.

254
00:14:23,989 --> 00:14:26,283
I don't know if I can take this guy, Sharon.

255
00:14:27,743 --> 00:14:29,328
So then, don't.

256
00:14:29,453 --> 00:14:32,748
You don't have to get in fights
 with other parents at Little League games!

257
00:14:32,789 --> 00:14:34,249
Just sit there and watch!

258
00:14:35,167 --> 00:14:37,044
Look, I get what you're trying to do.

259
00:14:37,753 --> 00:14:41,048
You're trying to get me to realize that
 I have to fight him because it's who I am.

260
00:14:41,089 --> 00:14:45,469
No, I'm telling you you don't have to get thrown 
out of games and make an ass of yourself.

261
00:14:45,511 --> 00:14:46,678
I've lost the edge.

262
00:14:47,513 --> 00:14:48,764
I'm sorry, Sharon.

263
00:14:49,139 --> 00:14:51,558
But you have to take Stan to his 
Little League game alone.

264
00:14:56,813 --> 00:15:00,400
Welcoem to the Colorado Little League
 State Championship Game!

265
00:15:01,735 --> 00:15:03,529
This must be pretty exciting for these youngsters.

266
00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:05,280
A chance to go to the national circuit.

267
00:15:08,075 --> 00:15:09,493
You know what these guys look like to me?

268
00:15:09,576 --> 00:15:10,661
A bunch of winners!

269
00:15:10,702 --> 00:15:12,704
Yeah! We're about to get our asses kicked!

270
00:15:12,871 --> 00:15:15,374
I don't think so! You guys are way too good!

271
00:15:15,415 --> 00:15:16,750
You're the best at this game!

272
00:15:16,792 --> 00:15:17,751
You're the best!

273
00:15:17,793 --> 00:15:20,295
You guys are so good you'll probably go 
all the way to win the national title!

274
00:15:20,337 --> 00:15:22,297
Not a chance, 'cause we're gonna lose to you right now!

275
00:15:22,381 --> 00:15:26,260
Here we go, Denver!
 These South Park kids got nothin' on you!

276
00:15:26,301 --> 00:15:27,928
Let's go, Denver!

277
00:15:28,178 --> 00:15:29,680
Chris, will you sit down?

278
00:15:30,097 --> 00:15:32,683
First up to bat for South Park, Kyle Schwartz.

279
00:15:34,518 --> 00:15:35,811
Where do I stand?

280
00:15:36,228 --> 00:15:37,312
R-right over here.

281
00:15:44,361 --> 00:15:48,198
Don't throw the ball too fast, 
because I might get startled and I have asthma.

282
00:15:51,577 --> 00:15:52,744
Strike 1!
Yeah! All right!

283
00:15:54,705 --> 00:15:56,456
Jesus, not so close!

284
00:15:56,582 --> 00:15:59,251
That was three feet from hitting me in the head!

285
00:15:59,501 --> 00:16:01,170
He's not gonna swing! Throw balls!

286
00:16:03,172 --> 00:16:04,047
Oh Jesus!

287
00:16:04,214 --> 00:16:05,591
Strike 2!

288
00:16:07,176 --> 00:16:09,136
Wow, he IS great at sucking.

289
00:16:09,261 --> 00:16:11,180
We're gonna lose! We're gonna lose!

290
00:16:11,346 --> 00:16:13,932
Don't throw it so hard or so close next time!

291
00:16:13,974 --> 00:16:16,476
Is it cold out here? I think I need a jacket.

292
00:16:23,150 --> 00:16:25,501
- It's a bunt!
- Run kid, run!

293
00:16:26,153 --> 00:16:27,404
Oh Jesus!

294
00:16:30,157 --> 00:16:31,158
Aw crap!

295
00:16:37,664 --> 00:16:39,583
I can't, I can't keep running like this!

296
00:16:39,625 --> 00:16:41,001
I have corns in my feet!

297
00:16:41,752 --> 00:16:42,794
Keep running, kid!

298
00:16:43,003 --> 00:16:46,632
Throw the ball to third, you idiots! He's runnin' home!

299
00:16:48,509 --> 00:16:49,593
Safe!

300
00:16:53,889 --> 00:16:55,390
Oh Jesus, did you see that??

301
00:16:55,432 --> 00:16:57,935
I hit a homerun! High-five, everybody!

302
00:16:59,144 --> 00:17:02,523
Oh my God... their pitcher was 
able to hit him right on the bat.

303
00:17:02,773 --> 00:17:04,066
Dude, we had it all wrong.

304
00:17:04,149 --> 00:17:06,318
While we spent all our time trying to make our tean suck,

305
00:17:06,610 --> 00:17:08,946
these guys practiced
 and got really good at sucking.

306
00:17:16,119 --> 00:17:16,954
No!

307
00:17:17,037 --> 00:17:18,539
Yeeaahh! Go Token go!

308
00:17:20,165 --> 00:17:23,043
All right, Denver! You're up to bat now!

309
00:17:32,719 --> 00:17:33,554
Out!

310
00:17:34,847 --> 00:17:37,182
Jesus Christ! They can bat themselves out!

311
00:17:43,188 --> 00:17:47,067
Our whole summer, dude.
 We have to play this boring game all summer long.

312
00:17:47,317 --> 00:17:48,819
Son of a biscuit!

313
00:17:52,322 --> 00:17:54,616
It's the bottom of the last inning here at Coors Field;

314
00:17:54,658 --> 00:17:57,870
the score is South Park 23, Denver 0.

315
00:18:01,915 --> 00:18:02,958
Strike 1!

316
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,418
Come on, Denver!

317
00:18:04,501 --> 00:18:05,711
Get the lead out!

318
00:18:05,752 --> 00:18:08,505
Do not cross the Bat Daaad!

319
00:18:08,922 --> 00:18:10,716
Geez I realy wish this guy would shut up.

320
00:18:10,883 --> 00:18:15,721
Why don't you just go home, South Park?
 You can't beat Denver!

321
00:18:15,929 --> 00:18:17,723
Denver sucks ass!

322
00:18:25,439 --> 00:18:28,358
Come on, South Park! 
These kids can't play!

323
00:18:28,984 --> 00:18:31,987
In fact, these kids are terrible!

324
00:18:36,283 --> 00:18:37,367
Strike 2!

325
00:18:37,493 --> 00:18:39,161
Oh Jesus, we're gonna win!

326
00:18:39,203 --> 00:18:42,039
I I never won a sport before; this is so exciting.

327
00:18:43,332 --> 00:18:46,251
It's over, Denver! South Park whupped your ass!

328
00:18:46,668 --> 00:18:49,922
You'd better shut your mouth
 before I shut it for you!

329
00:18:51,632 --> 00:18:53,050
What do you wanna do, huh?

330
00:19:00,974 --> 00:19:02,392
This can't get any worse.

331
00:19:08,232 --> 00:19:10,234
Now for the finishing move!

332
00:19:10,776 --> 00:19:13,904
You're about to be Bat-Dadded!

333
00:19:18,450 --> 00:19:23,372
It all comes down to this! South Park is just
one pitch away from being State Champions.

334
00:19:26,625 --> 00:19:29,253
Oh geez, it looks like two parents are fighting.

335
00:19:29,545 --> 00:19:32,548
They'd better be careful. 
The Little League has a no-tolerance policy.

336
00:19:33,549 --> 00:19:37,010
Stop! Stop, or you're gonna get your teams disqualified!

337
00:19:38,178 --> 00:19:39,346
Disqualified?

338
00:19:40,556 --> 00:19:42,015
Fight! Keep fighting!

339
00:19:45,143 --> 00:19:46,478
Break it up! Break it up!

340
00:19:59,324 --> 00:20:02,953
That's enough! The next person that
fights is getting his team disqualified!

341
00:20:03,287 --> 00:20:05,038
He's done for anyway.

342
00:20:08,417 --> 00:20:09,459
Come on, Dad! Get up!

343
00:20:09,585 --> 00:20:11,211
Get up! You have to fight!

344
00:20:13,213 --> 00:20:14,590
All right, come on! Let's play ball!

345
00:20:14,631 --> 00:20:17,551
RANDY! RANDY! RANDY!

346
00:20:19,052 --> 00:20:20,095
Get up, Randy!

347
00:20:20,721 --> 00:20:21,972
Get up, ya bum!

348
00:20:22,014 --> 00:20:23,724
Get up, Randy! Get up, ya bum!

349
00:20:23,807 --> 00:20:25,058
Get up, Randy! Fight! Fight for me!

350
00:20:34,526 --> 00:20:35,694
Hey Bat Dad!

351
00:20:39,072 --> 00:20:40,616
I didn't hear no bell.

352
00:20:45,370 --> 00:20:46,622
Stop, stop right now!

353
00:20:51,168 --> 00:20:52,503
I'm warning you, sir!

354
00:20:57,591 --> 00:21:00,677
That's it! That's it! South Park is disqualified!

355
00:21:03,931 --> 00:21:07,309
South Park has been disqualified
from the game! Denver wins!

356
00:21:14,408 --> 00:21:15,943
We... We lost.

357
00:21:17,694 --> 00:21:19,905
What? I thought this was a free country!

358
00:21:20,113 --> 00:21:20,739
Dad!

359
00:21:22,407 --> 00:21:23,450
You're the greatest.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
