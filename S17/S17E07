2
00:00:31,781 --> 00:00:34,353
The holiday season is here.

3
00:00:34,606 --> 00:00:37,684
And Black Friday is upon us.

4
00:00:38,278 --> 00:00:41,144
As you know, Black Friday is the day

5
00:00:41,269 --> 00:00:44,136
shoppers go berserk
for holiday deals.

6
00:00:44,261 --> 00:00:50,221
Last year, 26 people died
and 461 were seriously injured.

7
00:00:51,843 --> 00:00:55,656
This winter,
the mall is offering 80% off

8
00:00:55,781 --> 00:00:57,641
to the first 20 people in the store.

9
00:00:57,807 --> 00:00:59,434
- It'll be a bloodbath!
- Are you crazy?

10
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:00,778
For you new recruits,

11
00:01:00,903 --> 00:01:04,656
perhaps you took this job to see
just what the violence was like,

12
00:01:05,022 --> 00:01:07,287
or perhaps you
thought working Black Friday

13
00:01:07,412 --> 00:01:09,403
wouldn't be a big deal.

14
00:01:10,631 --> 00:01:13,115
I'm just trying to earn
some extra holiday cash.

15
00:01:13,281 --> 00:01:15,656
Or maybe you're just
too stupid to realize

16
00:01:15,781 --> 00:01:17,160
what you've gotten yourselves into.

17
00:01:17,326 --> 00:01:18,328
That's enough!

18
00:01:19,292 --> 00:01:21,656
Our only chance of surviving
this year's sale

19
00:01:21,781 --> 00:01:23,452
is by sticking together.

20
00:01:23,577 --> 00:01:26,420
Those of you who signed up
are to be commended.

21
00:01:26,781 --> 00:01:28,345
But I warn you,

22
00:01:28,952 --> 00:01:32,656
do not underestimate the battle
that's about to take place

23
00:01:32,781 --> 00:01:34,428
outside those doors.

24
00:01:38,290 --> 00:01:39,942
Winter is coming.

25
00:01:54,989 --> 00:01:56,089
Good evening, sir.

26
00:01:56,214 --> 00:01:58,503
I'm calling together
all the Fighters of Zaron.

27
00:01:58,628 --> 00:02:00,495
I need to speak with Lady McKormick.

28
00:02:01,793 --> 00:02:03,040
She's not here right now.

29
00:02:03,206 --> 00:02:05,656
Please tell her there's to be
a meeting in the great hall.

30
00:02:05,781 --> 00:02:08,009
I have found a way to get Xbox Ones

31
00:02:08,134 --> 00:02:10,523
and the Fair Lady McKormick
will want to hear about it.

32
00:02:16,510 --> 00:02:17,724
Thank you all for coming.

33
00:02:17,849 --> 00:02:20,656
Prince Token, Sir Timmy Of Blacklake,

34
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:22,684
Lady McKormick.

35
00:02:25,347 --> 00:02:28,106
Warriors, we have fought
many great battles together

36
00:02:28,272 --> 00:02:30,901
at Claude's house,
at Scott Malkinson's house.

37
00:02:31,067 --> 00:02:32,656
But soon we will be fighting
the greatest battle

38
00:02:32,781 --> 00:02:34,196
of our young, hot lives.

39
00:02:34,645 --> 00:02:36,114
Winter is coming.

40
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:38,658
And the next gen gaming devices
are hitting the shelves.

41
00:02:38,824 --> 00:02:40,285
Which nobody can afford.

42
00:02:40,451 --> 00:02:42,829
What if I were to tell you
that if we all work together

43
00:02:42,995 --> 00:02:45,207
there's a way we can
get the new gaming systems?

44
00:02:46,173 --> 00:02:48,043
If you know of a way Wizard,
then speak.

45
00:02:48,391 --> 00:02:50,480
I've learned of a dark magic at work.

46
00:02:50,781 --> 00:02:52,297
The day after Thanksgiving,

47
00:02:52,422 --> 00:02:53,837
the first 20 people inside the mall

48
00:02:53,962 --> 00:02:55,803
get 80% of whatever they want.

49
00:02:56,126 --> 00:02:59,359
They're calling it "Black Friday".

50
00:03:01,566 --> 00:03:03,006
Whoa! Spooky!

51
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:06,645
Black Friday?
Come on, that can't be real.

52
00:03:06,811 --> 00:03:08,772
It is real, Craig.
I saw it on the news, butthole.

53
00:03:08,938 --> 00:03:11,217
It is real.
They do it every year.

54
00:03:11,342 --> 00:03:13,311
But everyone in town tries
to be the first inside the mall

55
00:03:13,436 --> 00:03:14,212
on Black Friday.

56
00:03:14,337 --> 00:03:16,438
- What chance do we have?
- On our own, none.

57
00:03:16,563 --> 00:03:19,404
But if we plan, strategize,
and fight together,

58
00:03:19,529 --> 00:03:21,656
we can be the first people
inside on Black Friday

59
00:03:21,781 --> 00:03:23,891
and use the 60% to get
the gaming systems

60
00:03:24,016 --> 00:03:25,580
we need to survive.

61
00:03:26,170 --> 00:03:28,048
Well, it's almost Thanksgiving,

62
00:03:28,173 --> 00:03:29,656
and we all know what that means.

63
00:03:29,781 --> 00:03:32,446
That's right, Black Friday
is just around the corner.

64
00:03:32,571 --> 00:03:33,152
Ouch.

65
00:03:33,277 --> 00:03:35,215
And people are already gearing up.

66
00:03:35,381 --> 00:03:38,656
We usually start lining up
around 3:00 a.m.

67
00:03:38,781 --> 00:03:41,249
We, uh, douse ourselves in pig blood,

68
00:03:41,374 --> 00:03:43,437
because it does help us
slip through the crowd

69
00:03:43,562 --> 00:03:44,766
when the doors open.

70
00:03:44,932 --> 00:03:47,494
We do it every year,
part of the family tradition.

71
00:03:47,619 --> 00:03:49,656
Last year
we lost our youngest daughter.

72
00:03:49,781 --> 00:03:51,043
Her head was stepped on and crushed.

73
00:03:51,168 --> 00:03:51,989
But in her memory,

74
00:03:52,114 --> 00:03:55,068
we're going to find a young girl
and step on her head this year.

75
00:03:55,234 --> 00:03:59,287
If anyone thinks they're gonna
beat me inside that mall

76
00:03:59,412 --> 00:04:02,656
and keep me from getting
my kids' Christmas presents,

77
00:04:02,781 --> 00:04:05,495
they can kiss my fat vagina,

78
00:04:05,661 --> 00:04:08,498
'cause I'm bringing
the motherfucking pain.

79
00:04:08,664 --> 00:04:11,362
Tom, the South park mall
says they've beefed up security

80
00:04:11,487 --> 00:04:12,378
in an effort to reduce

81
00:04:12,503 --> 00:04:14,453
the number of fatalities this year.

82
00:04:14,578 --> 00:04:15,780
One thing's for sure,

83
00:04:15,905 --> 00:04:19,464
people take Black Friday
very seriously.

84
00:04:30,061 --> 00:04:32,827
Yes. Yes, very nice.
Good.

85
00:04:32,952 --> 00:04:35,656
Wizard Cartman, I have news
from the Internet, Milord.

86
00:04:35,781 --> 00:04:37,859
They don't salute
in <i>Game Of Thrones</i>, Butters.

87
00:04:37,984 --> 00:04:39,656
Sorry, I haven't watched it yet.

88
00:04:39,781 --> 00:04:40,859
Okay, well, you need
to start immediately, please.

89
00:04:40,984 --> 00:04:42,782
Ah, very good!

90
00:04:42,948 --> 00:04:45,118
The House of Greyhawk
has agreed to join our fight.

91
00:04:45,781 --> 00:04:48,121
- The House of Greyhawk?
- Larry and Brad stolsky.

92
00:04:48,287 --> 00:04:49,855
But, my friends,
we must still find others

93
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:50,959
who will fight by our side.

94
00:04:51,084 --> 00:04:53,418
Are there no other factions
we can call to our aid?

95
00:04:53,584 --> 00:04:54,463
Yeah, I know.

96
00:04:54,588 --> 00:04:56,546
How about we ask those kids
who play <i>Star Trek?</i>

97
00:04:56,947 --> 00:04:58,825
Uh, no, screw those guys.

98
00:04:58,950 --> 00:05:00,967
They're dorks
and I'm not playing with them.

99
00:05:03,552 --> 00:05:05,509
Hey, that's what I'm talking about.

100
00:05:05,634 --> 00:05:07,005
Got any extra of that?

101
00:05:08,238 --> 00:05:09,288
Oh, thanks.

102
00:05:09,876 --> 00:05:11,739
Gets a little boring
around here, you know?

103
00:05:12,671 --> 00:05:14,656
Enjoy the boredom while you can.

104
00:05:15,456 --> 00:05:17,023
So you worked here last winter?

105
00:05:17,148 --> 00:05:18,998
You worked on Black Friday?

106
00:05:19,536 --> 00:05:20,537
I did.

107
00:05:21,061 --> 00:05:23,362
Is it really as bad
as they say it is?

108
00:05:26,182 --> 00:05:27,432
The shoppers...

109
00:05:29,233 --> 00:05:31,393
Started showing up
at midnight on Thursday.

110
00:05:32,932 --> 00:05:34,781
They didn't line up,

111
00:05:34,906 --> 00:05:37,308
they just crammed themselves
near the main entrance.

112
00:05:37,859 --> 00:05:39,948
I can see their faces smushed up
against the glass,

113
00:05:40,073 --> 00:05:42,136
licking their lips,
waiting to get in.

114
00:05:42,716 --> 00:05:45,095
God, the sounds that they made.

115
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:47,627
It was 5:00 a.m.
when they opened they doors.

116
00:05:48,502 --> 00:05:50,732
There was screaming, blood,

117
00:05:51,989 --> 00:05:54,939
people tearing each other's faces off

118
00:05:55,064 --> 00:05:57,440
while holiday music played
in the background.

119
00:05:58,511 --> 00:06:01,476
I saw a woman pick up
her daughter by the ankle

120
00:06:01,601 --> 00:06:03,424
and swing her
into some old guy's head.

121
00:06:04,363 --> 00:06:07,660
Before I knew it, they were
all around me fighting, clawing.

122
00:06:08,367 --> 00:06:10,045
Then a hand reached in
and pulled me out.

123
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:13,942
Old cap.
He saved us all that day.

124
00:06:15,458 --> 00:06:16,399
When it was over,

125
00:06:16,978 --> 00:06:19,279
the front of the mall
was covered in red,

126
00:06:19,781 --> 00:06:22,090
bodies, shopping bags.

127
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:26,340
And now winter comes again.

128
00:06:29,399 --> 00:06:30,317
Wizard Cartman,

129
00:06:30,442 --> 00:06:32,128
I've watched some more
<i>Game Of Thrones.</i>

130
00:06:32,253 --> 00:06:33,993
Ah, yes, paladin Butters.
Are you enjoying it?

131
00:06:34,118 --> 00:06:35,656
Well, it's pretty good, I guess.

132
00:06:35,781 --> 00:06:37,071
But have you ever noticed
that almost every time

133
00:06:37,196 --> 00:06:40,149
they show a guy's wiener
that guy's character is gay?

134
00:06:40,274 --> 00:06:40,996
What do you mean?

135
00:06:41,121 --> 00:06:42,845
Well, it's just that they have
a lot of girls' boobs

136
00:06:42,970 --> 00:06:44,053
and vaginas and stuff,

137
00:06:44,178 --> 00:06:45,656
but most times
they show a man's wiener,

138
00:06:45,781 --> 00:06:48,093
it's because that guy's in
a love scene with another guy.

139
00:06:48,218 --> 00:06:49,878
You think it's because
gay wieners are less threatening

140
00:06:50,003 --> 00:06:51,080
to women viewers?

141
00:06:51,205 --> 00:06:53,057
I believe you might be missing
the greater point of show,

142
00:06:53,182 --> 00:06:53,944
Paladin Butters.

143
00:06:54,069 --> 00:06:54,791
Yeah, I know.

144
00:06:54,916 --> 00:06:57,373
Winter is coming, and there's
dragons and zombies on the way.

145
00:06:57,498 --> 00:06:58,672
I'm pretty excited for that.

146
00:06:58,797 --> 00:07:00,790
Just can do with a little less
gay wiener is all.

147
00:07:04,970 --> 00:07:06,656
We have word from the Kindergartners.

148
00:07:06,781 --> 00:07:07,656
They've agreed to join us.

149
00:07:09,139 --> 00:07:11,146
Those Xbox Ones are as good as ours.

150
00:07:11,271 --> 00:07:12,974
- Yeah!
- Wait, wait.

151
00:07:13,278 --> 00:07:15,143
What are you talking about,
Xbox Ones?

152
00:07:16,167 --> 00:07:17,656
That's what this is all about, Craig.

153
00:07:17,781 --> 00:07:19,564
We're all trying to get
Xbox Ones on Black Friday.

154
00:07:19,781 --> 00:07:21,691
I thought we were getting
Playstation 4s.

155
00:07:21,857 --> 00:07:24,736
- What?
- Uh, me too.

156
00:07:25,257 --> 00:07:26,245
No, guys,

157
00:07:26,370 --> 00:07:28,165
when I said we're gonna get
the next gen gaming systems,

158
00:07:28,290 --> 00:07:30,742
- I was obviously talking about Xboxes.
- Yeah.

159
00:07:30,908 --> 00:07:32,535
But I want a PS4, not a crappy Xbox.

160
00:07:32,701 --> 00:07:33,656
Look, guys.

161
00:07:33,781 --> 00:07:36,172
- We all have to agree on one system.
- That's right.

162
00:07:36,297 --> 00:07:39,192
If some of us are on PS4s,
but the rest of us are on Xboxes

163
00:07:39,317 --> 00:07:40,845
then we all
can't play together online.

164
00:07:40,970 --> 00:07:43,656
See? This is all about
committing to one machine.

165
00:07:43,963 --> 00:07:45,590
Right.
Let's all get PS4s.

166
00:07:46,170 --> 00:07:47,788
No, the Xboxes are gonna be better.

167
00:07:47,913 --> 00:07:49,476
They're not better,
they're just more expensive.

168
00:07:49,601 --> 00:07:53,056
We are getting Xbox Ones,
guys, and that is final.

169
00:07:53,222 --> 00:07:55,100
That's exactly how Xbox people are.

170
00:07:55,266 --> 00:07:56,690
- Yeah!
- Fine!

171
00:07:56,815 --> 00:07:58,327
If you guys don't wanna
join us on Black Friday

172
00:07:58,452 --> 00:07:59,896
to get Xboxes, then that's fine!

173
00:08:00,062 --> 00:08:01,529
We're still going to fight
on Black Friday,

174
00:08:01,654 --> 00:08:02,757
just not with you.

175
00:08:05,371 --> 00:08:06,910
Oh, it's going to be
like that, is it?

176
00:08:07,035 --> 00:08:09,634
Everyone who wants
to get PS4s, join with us.

177
00:08:10,375 --> 00:08:12,507
No, we can't divide like this.

178
00:08:18,371 --> 00:08:20,875
Stan, you're on our side, right?

179
00:08:22,823 --> 00:08:24,781
I like the PS4's controller better.

180
00:08:26,905 --> 00:08:29,263
Stan, the PS4 doesn't have
the seamless transition

181
00:08:29,388 --> 00:08:31,970
between games, movies, and TV
offered by Xbox One.

182
00:08:32,496 --> 00:08:35,361
The PS4 controller
has a touchpad interface.

183
00:08:35,486 --> 00:08:36,886
You never listen.

184
00:08:37,182 --> 00:08:38,726
I told you I thought
the PS4 was better,

185
00:08:38,892 --> 00:08:40,909
but you never wanted
to listen to me, Kyle.

186
00:08:41,306 --> 00:08:43,314
You just had your head so set
because...

187
00:08:44,821 --> 00:08:47,121
Because that's how Xbox people are.

188
00:08:49,377 --> 00:08:51,382
Then I guess I'll see you
on Black Friday.

189
00:08:52,666 --> 00:08:54,656
If I see you at the mall, Kyle,

190
00:08:54,781 --> 00:08:56,703
I will have to try
to beat you inside.

191
00:08:56,869 --> 00:08:57,870
I know.

192
00:08:59,246 --> 00:09:00,446
Come on, Kyle.

193
00:09:00,571 --> 00:09:01,508
Let these Sony fucks wallow

194
00:09:01,633 --> 00:09:03,793
in their limited voice control
functionality.

195
00:09:12,468 --> 00:09:15,369
♪ Christmas is coming,
goose is getting fat♪

196
00:09:17,574 --> 00:09:19,788
♪ Please do put a penny
in the old man's...♪

197
00:09:19,913 --> 00:09:20,982
What the hell are you doing?

198
00:09:21,107 --> 00:09:22,944
Oh, hey, Sharon.
You're up, huh?

199
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:25,872
I, uh...
all right, look.

200
00:09:25,997 --> 00:09:27,785
I took a temp job at the mall.

201
00:09:27,910 --> 00:09:30,158
I just wanted to make
some extra holiday cash.

202
00:09:30,283 --> 00:09:31,284
Bullshit.

203
00:09:32,083 --> 00:09:33,212
I did, Sharon!

204
00:09:33,337 --> 00:09:35,019
I saw they were hiring
extra security,

205
00:09:35,144 --> 00:09:36,576
and I thought it'd be a good way
to make money.

206
00:09:36,742 --> 00:09:38,656
You're doing this to try
and get to the front of line

207
00:09:38,781 --> 00:09:40,663
on Black Friday, aren't you?

208
00:09:42,706 --> 00:09:44,523
Nobody else
has thought of it, Sharon.

209
00:09:44,648 --> 00:09:45,949
I won't even be out in the crowd.

210
00:09:46,074 --> 00:09:48,087
I'll be on the inside
when the doors open.

211
00:09:48,253 --> 00:09:50,507
While everyone is trying
to run over each other,

212
00:09:50,673 --> 00:09:52,656
I'll turn around
and run right into the stores.

213
00:09:52,781 --> 00:09:55,011
I'll be the first to get
whatever I want.

214
00:09:55,177 --> 00:09:56,424
Isn't Black Friday supposed

215
00:09:56,549 --> 00:09:58,723
to be about buying things
for other people?

216
00:09:58,889 --> 00:10:00,724
Winter's coming, Sharon,

217
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:04,366
and I'm a sneaky little bee.
Buzz, buzz.

218
00:10:08,311 --> 00:10:10,110
{pub}Thrusters are at 20%, Captain.

219
00:10:10,235 --> 00:10:12,237
Engage, Ensign, warp factor one.

220
00:10:12,403 --> 00:10:15,490
Captain, we have an incoming
Facetime request from Eric Cartman.

221
00:10:15,656 --> 00:10:16,708
On screen.

222
00:10:16,833 --> 00:10:18,076
Oh, hey, guys.
What's up?

223
00:10:18,242 --> 00:10:18,725
Nothing much.

224
00:10:18,850 --> 00:10:20,482
We're just about to check out
a class "M" planet

225
00:10:20,607 --> 00:10:22,413
that might have new sources
of tririllium.

226
00:10:22,762 --> 00:10:24,274
God, these guys are such dorks.

227
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:25,918
Just find out who they're loyal to.

228
00:10:26,043 --> 00:10:27,518
Uh, yeah, big dong and prosper.

229
00:10:27,643 --> 00:10:29,879
Um, listen, guys.
You're Xbox people, right?

230
00:10:30,904 --> 00:10:32,567
Given the Xbox's faster frame rate,

231
00:10:32,692 --> 00:10:33,878
we have no choice but to declare it

232
00:10:34,003 --> 00:10:36,135
the most technologically fit
for Starfleet.

233
00:10:36,301 --> 00:10:37,878
Oh, my God, they're so gay.

234
00:10:38,003 --> 00:10:38,993
Um, cool.

235
00:10:39,118 --> 00:10:40,110
What if I were to tell you

236
00:10:40,235 --> 00:10:41,725
that we have a way for you to join us

237
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:44,060
in getting Xbox Ones super cheap?

238
00:10:44,226 --> 00:10:46,271
Cheap Xbox Ones?
For reals?

239
00:10:47,815 --> 00:10:49,357
The Federation has agreed
to fight with us.

240
00:10:49,523 --> 00:10:52,819
With them and the Kindergartners,
our army has just doubled in size.

241
00:10:54,903 --> 00:10:56,389
You still think you can convince Stan

242
00:10:56,514 --> 00:10:58,546
to come back to our side,
don't you, Sir Kyle?

243
00:10:59,452 --> 00:11:00,602
I don't know.

244
00:11:01,273 --> 00:11:02,996
You can't change his mind, Sir Kyle.

245
00:11:03,235 --> 00:11:05,110
Sony people don't think with logic.

246
00:11:05,235 --> 00:11:08,285
He betrayed us and now we must
out-Game-Of-Thrones him

247
00:11:08,410 --> 00:11:09,836
by making powerful alliances.

248
00:11:10,002 --> 00:11:11,337
Oh, don't even get me started!

249
00:11:11,503 --> 00:11:13,272
I keep watching that show
and I'm still waiting

250
00:11:13,397 --> 00:11:16,110
for the darn dragons to show up
and kick everyone's butts.

251
00:11:16,235 --> 00:11:18,110
But all I get is wiener,
wiener, wiener.

252
00:11:18,235 --> 00:11:19,610
It's not <i>all</i> gay wiener,

253
00:11:19,735 --> 00:11:21,110
but when they do show
a straight guy's wiener,

254
00:11:21,235 --> 00:11:22,511
it's all soft and floppy,

255
00:11:22,636 --> 00:11:24,511
even though he just got done
humping a pretty girl.

256
00:11:24,636 --> 00:11:25,472
Why is that?

257
00:11:25,597 --> 00:11:27,409
Because a soft wiener
isn't threatening,

258
00:11:27,534 --> 00:11:29,200
just like a gay wiener.

259
00:11:32,404 --> 00:11:34,694
Butters, you seem to be
somewhat obsessed with wieners.

260
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:37,655
<i>I'm</i> obsessed with wieners?
What about HBO?

261
00:11:37,821 --> 00:11:39,198
This isn't helping us, Butters.

262
00:11:39,364 --> 00:11:41,284
The Sony people might not be
our biggest problem.

263
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:44,110
Twitter says they're
introducing a new Elmo doll

264
00:11:44,235 --> 00:11:44,829
this Christmas.

265
00:11:45,307 --> 00:11:46,757
What new Elmo doll?

266
00:11:47,164 --> 00:11:48,916
Who, me?

267
00:11:49,082 --> 00:11:50,559
Just in time for the holidays,

268
00:11:50,684 --> 00:11:52,514
it's "Stop Touching Me Elmo".

269
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:53,799
When you press his back,

270
00:11:53,924 --> 00:11:56,467
Elmo puts his hand on your knee
and says fun things.

271
00:11:56,592 --> 00:11:58,948
Have you ever been tickled
on the inside?

272
00:11:59,802 --> 00:12:01,871
I'm lonely.
Are you lonely?

273
00:12:02,471 --> 00:12:05,141
Can I watch you go potty?

274
00:12:05,307 --> 00:12:07,708
You wanna kiss the guy
who does Elmo's voice?

275
00:12:08,910 --> 00:12:10,110
Stop touching me, Elmo!

276
00:12:10,235 --> 00:12:12,398
Elmo also helps kids
brush their teeth

277
00:12:12,564 --> 00:12:14,110
with his toothpaste dispenser.

278
00:12:14,235 --> 00:12:15,793
More, more, more, ohhh!

279
00:12:16,245 --> 00:12:18,673
Don't miss out on this holiday
season's biggest gift.

280
00:12:18,798 --> 00:12:20,110
Stop Touching Me Elmo.

281
00:12:20,235 --> 00:12:23,409
Available at South park Mall,
starting Black Friday.

282
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:25,645
Good morning, Joe, Marcus.

283
00:12:25,770 --> 00:12:29,101
- Morning, Randy.
- What madness is this?

284
00:12:30,332 --> 00:12:31,632
What is it, sir?

285
00:12:32,222 --> 00:12:33,878
A new Elmo doll.

286
00:12:34,044 --> 00:12:35,839
They're releasing a new Elmo doll

287
00:12:35,964 --> 00:12:37,882
just in time for Black Friday.

288
00:12:38,048 --> 00:12:39,175
Oh, Christ, no.

289
00:12:39,731 --> 00:12:43,429
You've murdered us,
you soulless monsters.

290
00:12:43,595 --> 00:12:44,824
You've killed us all.

291
00:12:48,851 --> 00:12:51,229
Oh, God, they're already lining up.

292
00:12:52,504 --> 00:12:55,110
Elmoooo.

293
00:12:55,607 --> 00:12:56,951
No, they can't line up this soon.

294
00:12:57,076 --> 00:13:00,381
- This is crazy.
- I'll deal with these demons.

295
00:13:02,353 --> 00:13:04,110
If you're here for Black Friday,

296
00:13:04,235 --> 00:13:06,285
the line starts on that side
of the rope.

297
00:13:06,451 --> 00:13:08,110
This rope right here?

298
00:13:08,235 --> 00:13:09,680
That's the line for Black Friday

299
00:13:09,805 --> 00:13:11,840
so other people can do
normal shopping today.

300
00:13:11,965 --> 00:13:13,280
Oh, okay, thanks.

301
00:13:15,341 --> 00:13:17,110
Elmoooo.

302
00:13:17,235 --> 00:13:19,716
Give me Elmo.

303
00:13:19,882 --> 00:13:21,426
We come seeking your help.

304
00:13:21,793 --> 00:13:23,797
Do you side
with those wanting Xboxes,

305
00:13:24,052 --> 00:13:25,591
or will you join us on Black Friday

306
00:13:25,716 --> 00:13:27,482
and fight for PS4s?

307
00:13:29,290 --> 00:13:30,560
Are you for real?

308
00:13:30,726 --> 00:13:32,110
You know that the PS4
is a better choice.

309
00:13:32,235 --> 00:13:33,438
I mean, come on.

310
00:13:33,604 --> 00:13:35,110
Of course we're going to go
with the PS4.

311
00:13:35,235 --> 00:13:37,321
- They're blacker.
- Then join us.

312
00:13:37,446 --> 00:13:40,236
We need people to help us
be the first 20 inside the mall.

313
00:13:40,402 --> 00:13:41,383
Uh, we're just gonna wait

314
00:13:41,508 --> 00:13:43,823
until the PS4s become cheaper
and more available.

315
00:13:43,989 --> 00:13:46,110
- No, you can't do that.
- You can't do that.

316
00:13:46,235 --> 00:13:46,841
Don't you see?

317
00:13:46,966 --> 00:13:48,536
This is about more than Black Friday.

318
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:50,110
Battle lines are being drawn.

319
00:13:50,235 --> 00:13:51,401
If you wait it out

320
00:13:51,526 --> 00:13:53,440
but everyone else has already
decided to go with Xbox,

321
00:13:53,565 --> 00:13:55,458
then that will become the standard.

322
00:13:55,768 --> 00:13:58,421
The PS4 would be like
what Betamax was to VHS.

323
00:13:59,426 --> 00:14:02,008
- What's Betamax?
- Exactly.

324
00:14:02,174 --> 00:14:03,509
What's VHS?

325
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:07,699
Look, we're just asking people
who want to play on PS4s

326
00:14:07,824 --> 00:14:09,432
to fight for what they believe in.

327
00:14:10,517 --> 00:14:12,643
Sorry, I guess
we just don't care enough.

328
00:14:13,388 --> 00:14:14,574
Come on, Sir Stan.

329
00:14:14,699 --> 00:14:16,939
There must be kids somewhere
who will join us.

330
00:14:22,317 --> 00:14:25,110
Lady McKormick, I was hoping
I could talk to you about Kyle.

331
00:14:27,235 --> 00:14:29,110
I'm not sure if his heart
is in the right place.

332
00:14:29,235 --> 00:14:32,683
If he were to ever switch sides,

333
00:14:33,235 --> 00:14:35,110
it could make Stan's army
problematic for us.

334
00:14:37,334 --> 00:14:38,267
True, but we can't let Kyle

335
00:14:38,392 --> 00:14:40,171
come in the way
of what's rightfully ours.

336
00:14:40,337 --> 00:14:42,110
Let's face it, Lady McKormick,

337
00:14:42,235 --> 00:14:44,674
this is really about you and me
getting Xbox Ones.

338
00:14:44,799 --> 00:14:46,110
The others are simply there

339
00:14:46,235 --> 00:14:47,762
to help us get inside those doors.

340
00:14:51,235 --> 00:14:52,963
You have a strong influence
over the rest of the men,

341
00:14:53,088 --> 00:14:54,110
Lady McKormick.

342
00:14:54,768 --> 00:14:56,547
All I'm saying is that
when the time comes,

343
00:14:56,672 --> 00:14:59,110
I might need you
to use that influence

344
00:14:59,235 --> 00:15:01,087
to have Kyle taken care of.

345
00:15:02,092 --> 00:15:03,602
Do we understand each other?

346
00:15:05,464 --> 00:15:08,866
Hey, you damn kids!
Get the hell out of my yard.

347
00:15:09,032 --> 00:15:11,077
Fuck you, dude.
This is the Garden of Andros.

348
00:15:11,243 --> 00:15:12,694
No, it's my damn garden,

349
00:15:12,819 --> 00:15:14,233
and I'm sick of you kids dressing up

350
00:15:14,358 --> 00:15:16,666
and having talks of betrayal in it.

351
00:15:16,832 --> 00:15:17,785
? Buzz, buzz, buzz

352
00:15:17,910 --> 00:15:20,127
? Buzz, buzz, buzz

353
00:15:20,692 --> 00:15:22,110
70-inch television.

354
00:15:22,235 --> 00:15:23,638
That would be good.

355
00:15:23,763 --> 00:15:26,025
Ooh, but 80% off a computer.

356
00:15:26,150 --> 00:15:28,344
Maybe I'll be able to snag both.

357
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:29,929
- Doing all right there, rookie?
- Oh! Yes, sir.

358
00:15:30,095 --> 00:15:31,110
Sorry, didn't mean to scare you.

359
00:15:31,235 --> 00:15:33,110
No, I was just looking
at all these great things

360
00:15:33,235 --> 00:15:34,652
I can't afford.

361
00:15:35,450 --> 00:15:39,355
Listen, I know why you took
this part-time job.

362
00:15:40,221 --> 00:15:41,482
Youyou do?

363
00:15:41,939 --> 00:15:45,110
I see it in you.
You care about people.

364
00:15:45,698 --> 00:15:47,613
Same reason I do it every year.

365
00:15:48,472 --> 00:15:50,172
You remind me of my son.

366
00:15:50,814 --> 00:15:53,115
He died on Black Friday in '89.

367
00:15:53,539 --> 00:15:55,502
Guess I'm still trying to save him.

368
00:15:56,410 --> 00:15:58,040
Look, I just want to say I...

369
00:15:58,206 --> 00:16:00,685
I really appreciate
what you're doing.

370
00:16:01,097 --> 00:16:04,640
I promised my wife this would be
the last Black Friday I worked.

371
00:16:04,765 --> 00:16:06,941
When I see folks like you,

372
00:16:07,359 --> 00:16:10,110
it makes me hopeful
that people will still be okay.

373
00:16:10,684 --> 00:16:12,763
Yeah, awesome.

374
00:16:12,929 --> 00:16:15,604
Aw, damn it, no lining up
behind the velvet rope.

375
00:16:15,729 --> 00:16:17,792
They just don't listen.

376
00:16:19,127 --> 00:16:20,128
&

377
00:16:20,610 --> 00:16:22,233
Buzz, buzz.

378
00:16:27,644 --> 00:16:29,780
{pub}Cartman's army is getting
bigger every day.

379
00:16:29,946 --> 00:16:32,113
In addition to the Federation
and the Kindergartners,

380
00:16:32,238 --> 00:16:33,956
the Xbox Army now also has the kids

381
00:16:34,081 --> 00:16:35,457
who play <i>Harry Potter,</i> the Jocks,

382
00:16:35,582 --> 00:16:37,113
the Swim Team, and the Glee Club.

383
00:16:37,687 --> 00:16:40,207
Word is that the sixth graders
all prefer Xbox too

384
00:16:40,373 --> 00:16:42,113
and will team up
with Cartman as well.

385
00:16:42,238 --> 00:16:43,514
And who do we have on our side?

386
00:16:43,639 --> 00:16:46,182
Besides us, it's the Book Club
and Janice Pinkerton.

387
00:16:47,128 --> 00:16:50,428
- Did you ask the Vamp Kids?
- They're still undecided.

388
00:16:51,150 --> 00:16:53,471
There has to be a way to get people
on the fence to join our side.

389
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:56,113
Playstation.

390
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:59,583
Look, sir Stan, it's probably
time to give this up.

391
00:16:59,708 --> 00:17:01,515
We're just a dying breed, Stan.

392
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:03,564
Xbox is going to win
this whole thing.

393
00:17:03,730 --> 00:17:07,318
So we're just going to let other kids
decide which game system we all play on?

394
00:17:08,389 --> 00:17:10,154
What would they do
on <i>Game Of Thrones?</i>

395
00:17:11,052 --> 00:17:14,003
What would they do
when things look their darkest?

396
00:17:25,238 --> 00:17:26,239
Huh?

397
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:30,113
Sorry, to disturb you, sir,

398
00:17:30,238 --> 00:17:32,218
but we thought you should see this.

399
00:17:39,144 --> 00:17:41,530
"Winter is coming.

400
00:17:42,238 --> 00:17:44,113
Choose side."

401
00:17:45,981 --> 00:17:48,113
Just a small town in middle America,

402
00:17:48,238 --> 00:17:50,717
but apparently a war's escalating.

403
00:17:50,842 --> 00:17:53,113
Sir, if this were to become
a news story,

404
00:17:53,238 --> 00:17:56,487
and if the first people
inside that mall all got Xboxes,

405
00:17:57,238 --> 00:17:59,161
it clearly looks bad for our image.

406
00:18:05,540 --> 00:18:09,113
What's going to be the big item
everyone goes for this Black Friday?

407
00:18:09,238 --> 00:18:11,903
It just might be the Playstation 4.

408
00:18:12,028 --> 00:18:16,276
Sony has just announced they're
offering a special Black Friday bundle

409
00:18:16,401 --> 00:18:18,844
called the "Brack Friday Bunduru",

410
00:18:18,969 --> 00:18:20,877
which will include four controllers,

411
00:18:21,002 --> 00:18:23,251
a map of Japan, $100 rebate,

412
00:18:23,376 --> 00:18:26,022
and allow you
to automatically preorder

413
00:18:26,147 --> 00:18:27,980
for <i>Metal Gear Solid 5</i>.

414
00:18:28,238 --> 00:18:31,349
No doubt Sony
has just raised the stakes.

415
00:18:32,714 --> 00:18:34,170
Yes.
Good, Federation Kids.

416
00:18:34,295 --> 00:18:35,794
You're learning to fight
with your hands.

417
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:37,408
Keep pushing, Kindergartners.

418
00:18:39,729 --> 00:18:42,330
Sir Kyle, I know that Sony's offering

419
00:18:42,455 --> 00:18:44,113
a special Black Friday Bunduru.

420
00:18:44,238 --> 00:18:46,113
You know the Xbox
is still better, right?

421
00:18:46,238 --> 00:18:48,250
Yeah, but why can't Xbox

422
00:18:48,375 --> 00:18:50,383
automatically let you
preorder <i>Metal Gear Solid 5</i>?

423
00:18:50,623 --> 00:18:53,729
Sir Kyle, preorder doesn't
mean shit, okay?

424
00:18:54,299 --> 00:18:56,514
When you preorder a game, you're just
committing to paying for something

425
00:18:56,639 --> 00:18:59,346
that some assholes in California
haven't even finished working on yet.

426
00:18:59,512 --> 00:19:01,113
You know what you get
for preordering a game?

427
00:19:01,238 --> 00:19:02,933
A big dick in your mouth.

428
00:19:07,231 --> 00:19:08,471
All right, listen up.

429
00:19:08,596 --> 00:19:10,350
The mall's no longer allowing people

430
00:19:10,475 --> 00:19:13,402
to line up for Black Friday
until Thanksgiving night.

431
00:19:15,737 --> 00:19:16,951
It's okay.

432
00:19:17,076 --> 00:19:20,113
To hold places in line,
we're handing out wristbands.

433
00:19:21,159 --> 00:19:23,113
Ahh! Oh, God!
Oh, my God!

434
00:19:23,238 --> 00:19:25,206
Wristbands!

435
00:19:25,372 --> 00:19:27,966
Back! Back all of you!

436
00:19:28,917 --> 00:19:31,113
If that's how you are,
there'll be no wristbands.

437
00:19:31,238 --> 00:19:32,421
- Now go!
- Ow!

438
00:19:32,546 --> 00:19:33,881
Back away.

439
00:19:35,215 --> 00:19:37,676
I'm getting my son
that Elmo doll, you fuck!

440
00:19:39,719 --> 00:19:40,720
No!

441
00:19:43,801 --> 00:19:48,020
You did good.
The watch is yours now.

442
00:19:48,446 --> 00:19:53,113
No, you can't die.
Everybody really likes you.

443
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:55,942
This is what we signed up for,

444
00:19:56,384 --> 00:19:57,988
right, my friend?

445
00:19:58,238 --> 00:20:00,113
No, I was lying to you.

446
00:20:00,238 --> 00:20:04,563
I took this job to be at the front of
the line on Black Friday.

447
00:20:05,227 --> 00:20:08,728
Ha. Now you know how serious this is.

448
00:20:10,238 --> 00:20:13,530
Whatever your intentions before,
protect this town.

449
00:20:13,954 --> 00:20:16,396
You are in charge now.

450
00:20:16,989 --> 00:20:18,302
Take this.

451
00:20:20,332 --> 00:20:24,807
Don't let Black Friday be the end.

452
00:20:42,836 --> 00:20:46,619
Get back inside.
We have work to do.

453
00:20:53,340 --> 00:20:55,113
When we started this fight,

454
00:20:55,429 --> 00:20:57,330
it was because we were tired
of Xbox people

455
00:20:57,455 --> 00:20:59,113
telling us Playstation sucked.

456
00:20:59,475 --> 00:21:02,428
Now we're an army of our own.

457
00:21:07,182 --> 00:21:09,018
I can't guarantee you will live,

458
00:21:09,687 --> 00:21:12,188
but I can guarantee
that before this is over

459
00:21:12,354 --> 00:21:15,065
the winner of the console wars
will be decided.

460
00:21:17,942 --> 00:21:19,778
Our new leader has joined us

461
00:21:19,944 --> 00:21:23,032
to help make sure that system
is the PS4.

462
00:21:23,905 --> 00:21:26,333
All hail the Princess!

463
00:21:30,121 --> 00:21:31,874
The Princess!

464
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:36,545
